I'm afraid I made a huge mistake.\nPOST: I left my girlfriend after two years of being together, moving to France, and proposing to her. She said yes, but I felt as if there was so much pressure to live a life that I didn't want. I wasn't myself anymore, and I had sacrificed a lot. So I left. Her. I moved back to the US, and now we're going on 2-3 months apart. We talk a little, but I'm always reserved.\n\nI miss her. So badly. My life is empty without her, and I'm afraid I made a huge mistake. Part of me wants to get back with her, but going back into that cage of a foreign land, no career prospects and struggling to break even at the age of 30 seems daunting. Also, I'm not really sure she'd even take me back.\n\nI've begun to rebuild my life here in the US,  but it doesn't feel the same anymore. It's.... not the same to do this without her. I know she misses what we had, but I don't know if she'll take me back. Or even if it's the right thing to do. I'm just afraid I didn't try hard enough.\n\nHelp? Please.\nTL;DR:"}

We've discussed engagement, children, and picked out a ring last weekend.  Things are going well right?  Well, the last week or so she's been on my case, constantly texting/nagging when I'm not at home.  I've told her multiple times to take a look at my phone whenever she wants if it's bothering her that much.\n\nLast weekend, she informs me her and her best friend (who's an absolute disaster) are planning to go to Mexico as they're both teachers and have the same spring break this year.  I wouldn't have an issue with them going somewhere together but do 30 year old women still go on spring break together?  What really irritates me is that we're SUPPOSED to be saving money to buy another home.  In addition, the best friend is AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER.  She recently received her 2nd DUI and was able to wrack up 2 or 3 felony assault charges when she was fighting with police during the DUI stop (how does she still have her job??).  My GF and I have had multiple fights/discussions over her lack of control when she's with her friend.\n\nThe two of them used to regularly go on spring break together and the stories I've heard are ridiculous.  Drinking too much, passing out in random spots all over the resort, etc.  I can't help but think my GF would blow a gasket if I told her I was going on spring break without her.  While I do trust my gf I'm also a realist ... I know what happens on spring break.  I don't want to give her the ultimatum of 'it's me or spring break' but I'm having a tough time believing her when she says she's ready for kids, marriage, etc.\nTL;DR:"}

She is very clear that she doesn't expect me to pay rent since this was the apartment that she chose and I can't financially do this now.\n\nI love her and I love the idea of moving in together but I guess I'm worried that this will backfire because of the economical situation.\n\nAm I worried for no reason?\nTL;DR:"}

In the beginning for 4 months I was in a job I enjoyed and with my friends having not too many problems. This is my first real relationship too, I might add. I've worried about things throughout the relationship. Usually minor and he's allayed them as we reached them.\n\nThen in the 5th month it got serious, I changed jobs to one I didn't like and started to worry about my life. By month 8, I wanted to move on from my job and get a job near him. I applied for some jobs and decided to move in with him, thinking that I would secure one of them. I applied for a job I really want but it doesn't start until Sept and until I know (soon I will) if I got it or not, life seems to be going down hill emotionally for me. I am farther away from friends who are also going through problems and we no longer work together.\n\nI think we both doubt this relationship. While supportive, we haven't said any \"I love you\"s...I don't think we are ready to do that. There are some fundamental differences that are eating away at me... he sucks the fun out of traveling and me making food, two things I love to do. He sort of has a \"meh\" outlook on life. I feel like there are a lot of issues with my being lost and without a job and not near friends and positiveness. I don't know how things are supposed to be, but it's not really fun and exciting when I'm with him. But I want to make it so. I feel like everything is going down hill... I'm not confident it will last and I don't know if it can be fixed.\nTL;DR:"}

The third place being where we currently live. We moved recently to her hometown after living pretty far away for about a year and a half. We met in college and when we met we were both cheating on our significant others. She lied about that to me while I was upfront about it with her. We were in college so I didn't think much of it I guess.\n\nEverything was great up until we moved.  Shes been distant towards me, physically and verbally. We were having sex about once a day or once every two days, and talking all the time. We had great chemistry. But since we moved we have had sex about 4 times a month and we barely talk. We just sit in silence and watch tv and I can never get her to do anything with me unless it's hitting a drive-thru or something. \n\nShe recently started talking to this guy that she cheated with her ex-boyfriend with a lot. She is very protective of her phone and will change the whole way she sits if I can see her phone. I have asked her about it and brought up my concerns about this other guy. She will go on walks late in the evening and won't text back for hours at a time, usually about four hours is how long she's gone. Whenever I bring any of this up to her and try to have a rational discussion with her she just gets angry\n\nI am not sure what to think of all of this. I don't know what to do, if I should go through her phone, or keep trying to talk to her. I'm just young, clueless, and lost. I need some advice\nTL;DR:"}

I started a relationship, and things got bad - I leaked some details to my GF about an ex of mine who my former best friend considers a sister that led my GF to believe I still had a thing for the ex or regarded her in a special way (I don't and didn't). Eventually, the fallout from that friction between me, BF, ex, and GF led to me explicitly cutting my friend out of my life, and we haven't talked for nearly 2 years - I emailed him a couple times and he didn't respond at all. \n\nI miss him every time I think of him, I've considered breaking up with my GF and contacting him to see if he'd be interested in resuming contact, and I haven't been able to find someone to fill this hole that I created. I have no delusions here: this choice of her over him was fundamentally up to me, though it would have been tough to choose BF over GF since she and I lived together then and were pretty broke. At this point, the health of my relationship is secondary to my health as a person, and I can't separate my lackluster feelings about her from my general malaise about having no close friends anymore. I have to get over this somehow - what questions should I ask myself to decide what my right course of action is (some combination of: dump GF, hang out with dudes to find new good friends, force ex-best friend to respond and get his feelings about this to see if it's worth rekindling, accept the loss and move on)?

I've tried to talk to her and get everything worked out between us, but she's headstrong, and I'm distant, so it ends in more problems caused then solved as well as both of us angry.\n\nI really do love her, and she is an amazing person. We both just have a lot of stress in our lives, and neither of us have a very good way of fixing that stress, so we take it out on each other. \n\nThis situation certainly isn't helping, and on top of all of this, we're just kids trying to finish high school. I'm absolutely lost, and I'm begging for help.\nTL;DR:"}

I have been having periods since I was 13 but over the past year as they got more regular they have become really bad. They only last about about five days but the first three days are extremely painful. I think its worse then normal cramps, the pain is so bad I sometimes throw up, its similar to the pain I felt when I had to have my appendix removed. The first two or three days I can't really get out of bed and just have to curl  up in a ball for hours. I have had to miss days of school and shifts at work because it. I have tried taking different pain killers but they don't do very much.\n\nI have told my mum about it but she thinks I'm making it up. She thinks I'm just trying to get days off school and the thing is I have lied about being sick to get days off in the past and its kind of like the boy who cried wolf now. I have also told my dad and he just said I was being a drama queen and need to get over myself. I have asked them to take me to a doctor (we live about an hours drive away and public transport is almost nonexistent) in case something really is wrong but they say that they aren't going to feed into it.\n\n The more I bring it up the more mum refuses to talk to me about it and now she has started ignoring me completely. The other day I tried to ask talk to my dad about it and he made some pretty gross jokes in front of the whole family. It has kind of become a household joke now and its really embarrassing. \n\nAny advice on what to do is very welcome.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm male, and currently around 260lbs.  I think I need to be around 150lbs for my height so I have a ~~nice~~ long way to go.\n\nI'm also ridiculously unfit.  Ideally I want to build muscle so that I appear more toned when I'm at my ideal weight, but I also just want to increase my fitness levels generally too.  I bought the Insanity workout thinking 'oh if you can do it at home with no equipment I should be able to do that'.  Well, at 260lbs, the Fit Test alone kicked my butt. \n\nMy biggest concern with it was the amount of jumping - I feel its probably better for someone of a lower weight who wants to tone up.  It felt awkward on my joints when 260lbs came crashing down on them!  So I don't think its really suitable for me at this point in time.  To be honest, just the 'warm up' nearly killed me!\n\nSo I wanted to ask your advice of some exercise I can do at home to start increasing my fitness levels.  I'm afraid the gym isn't an option at the moment - my self esteem and confidence levels are at an all time low and there's simply no way at the moment I could cope with joining a gym.  I need something that won't destroy my joints (not too much jumping!) but will increase my fitness levels, maybe to the point I can start the Insanity workout at a later date.  I guess I'm looking for some sort of cardio but don't know where to start.  A lot of the home workout stuff I've found is based on bodyweight fitness, and I think my size is going to make it too difficult for that.\n\nAt the moment I walk around 3 miles a day, but I've done this for years and it doesn't seem to affect my fitness levels at all really.  The Fit Test of the Insanity workout had me on the floor within about 20 seconds!\nTL;DR:"}

There is just so much I want to do while Im young, I want to travel, see the world, experience things, people and cultures. She isn't really in to all that because she hates flying so our travel options would be limited.

The smaller part of my head is saying that I might not find someone like this girl again, which I know seems silly but like I said, we REALLYYYY just are in sync about everything and have similar wants and goals in life(aside from traveling and all that stuff)\nTL;DR:"}

She and I agreed it was because of the dog that we got, however she also says that her birth control lowers her libido.\n\nWe just went on a couples vacation to Punta Cana and then to New Orleans with friends. The vacation in Punta Cana was great but she was on her period and we only had sex once. In New Orleans she partied with our friends until 5 AM two nights in a row. I had to turn in early because I had to attend a conference in the mornings.\n\nWhen we got back from New Orleans she became more distant -no sex for 2 weeks at this point. She stopped wedding planning and I picked up the slack. She has been avoiding being home much at all -working extra shifts ect. I called her out last night and asked her why she was acting so strange. She told me that she was freaking out about the wedding and didnt know if she wanted to get married. I am not sure what she said after that because my world fell apart. I left and went to a bar to compose myself.

He can hold conversations with my but there often kind of out of place, a little awkward and without much eye contact. He's pretty intelligent and friendly but socially awkaward. \n\nGuy 2: He's called Josh he's a little more extreme on the scale. He used to eat lunch in the same room as me and my friends sophmore and he never said anything to me until the end of that year where he said he thought of me as a good friend even though we never talked before that. He occassionally finds me in the hallway or after school and asks how my day is and i say its been good and he'll say his day was good as well and will abruptly end the conversation and walk away quickly. He usually can't look at my eyes sometimes he walks behind me and talks to me. \n \nSo far I've been just talking to them like anyone else because I'm sure they just want to be treated like anyone else. But i want to be prepared incase it gets a little difficult so i can handle it the best way possible.

She had a boyfriend , who she had been with for 3 years and I really wanted to be with her but at the same time felt awful if I had sabotaged a relationship. \n\nTime goes by and we seem to become really close; there were several instances of her leaning for the kiss, sexual inuendos and a lot of tension but I was sometimes caught off guard and responded stupidly or i was feeling guilty, so nothing really happened. Later that year she changes univeristy and in a last attempt of regret , i make an ass of myself telling her that I care about her as she is set on leaving the next day ; again i turn down the kiss (WHY?....JUST WHY???). \n\nEvery single day since, I think about her and i'm filled with regret. But we skype every other day or so , then it becomes every week, then every two weeks and now once a month. Its like she is slowly falling in indifference. Unable to take it any longer I phone her one night (last week) , putting everyhting on the table and I obviously it didnt pan out well - in fact worse than what I had ever thought; she just says that she never saw me as more than a friend. I'm horribly confused, all of those moments, what does it all mean? \n\nI know i have to move on, but i'm angry at myself for having been such a pussy with her, i have so much regret and overall those last few months have been tough on me and i've slowly isolated myself from everyone. On top of that, in the past I have alienated some friends with oversharing my problems and I don't want to do this again. Any advice on how I could put my love life and my social life back on track. Thank you to all the redditers.\nTL;DR:"}

He leaves his washing and ironing until the last minute and lets it pile up on the floor.\n\n6. He will sometimes not shower for 2+ days. I never noticed this before as I assumed he used to shower before seeing me, but it's really starting to get to me because it's gross and his whole manly area smells of cheese.\n\n7.

I had just turned 19. My parents were told it would be covered by insurance but turns out that it expired the day after said surgery. I couldn't afford to return to the dentist to get it checked after the surgery so I have been stuck with a gaping hole with jagged super sharp root-deep pieces of tooth for almost 3 years.\n\nI'm about to turn 22, and I simply cannot afford health insurance. I've tried making an appointment at UCLA medical center but it hasn't happened.\n\nThis has severely impacted my life, I used to have head-splitting toothaches and completely avoid eating with the right side of my mouth.\nMy question for you guys: Is this something I could continue living with health-wise?

I'd like to know if there are serious health risks that I am exposed to.

If you look up the rates in my area, that's lower than it should be.  The reason is that I have a discount through my employer.\n\nLast month, Cox offered me a free trial of Premier for 6 months.  I figured, what the hell let me try it for 6 months then cancel it.  Turns out, this free trial was incompatible with other deals (oops; duh) so they silently canceled my employee discount and bumped me up to the standard cost of Preferred Internet... about 70 bucks a month after fees.  The worst thing, is that speed tests showed that the real-world speed for the upgrade was barely any faster.\n\nNo big deal right... I just need to downgrade and have my employee discount set up again.  This is where my fuck-up became clear.  The old rate was grandfathered in.

We aren't boyfriend and girlfriend, but we pretty much act as we are. We talk everyday go on dates etc. She is a Senior in College about an hour away and i work in our hometown. \n\nSo when we talk i just feel like i put so much more effort in than she does for example i always text her first, which i dont mind but its nice to receive a text first every now and then.

I know this arent horrible problems but now i understand what people mean by saying it's the little things that matter.\n\nSo this weekend i brought it up to her and she knew right away and she agreed. So she said she was going to work on it. So we were hanging out on sunday and she instagramed a picture of us. She never did something like that before.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: How does one gain romantic/sexual \"confidence\" with little to no basis for such confidence?\nPOST: 26/M here. Despite my title making me sound like I'm lacking confidence, I've done a lot of dating and have had plenty of experiences. Some of them good, but a lot of bad ones. I'm not super tall (5'6'') and I wouldn't say I'm great looking, but I clean up nice. I'm handsome, but I'm not \"hot\".\n\nHere's what I'm wondering. I've already established that I'm a short, fairly average looking guy. People talk all the time about how \"confidence is key, confidence is sexy, blah, blah\", which is fine at face value, but it would seem that confidence is largely gained from external assurance (i.e., someone telling you that you're attractive, getting hit on, etc). It would be easy to walk up to a man/woman \"knowing\" that you've got a good chance of success because you've gotten plenty of positive reinforcement. But what about those of use who aren't in the upper echelons of physical beauty, who have had little to no assurance of their attractiveness (or worse even, negative reinforcement)?\n\nThe approach I've taken over the years is \"fake it 'til you make it\", which seems to work from time to time. If I'm honest, there are times when I DO feel a genuine confidence, but there are still many time where I find myself thinking \"she's out of your league, she won't go for a guy like you\". It's not because I hold myself at a low value, it's because my past experience have \"taught\" me where my boundaries lie.\n\nTo put a bow on this whole thing, I don't think little of myself. In fact, I'd say my self-worth is high. I'm intelligent, educated, I've got my life together, I'm ambitious, athletic, etc, etc... But none of those traits are visible when approaching a stranger. How does one gain confidence in the romantic arena when they have no prior basis for such confidence.\n\nThank you all! Any advice, insight, wisdom is greatly appreciate and valued!\nTL;DR:"}

I personally believe that he has bipolar disorder or a paranoid personality disorder, but I'm no doctor. He has really good days, where he is a normal person with good behavior, and really bad days where he will criticize me for anything and everything and yell at and talk down to waiters or store staff over really menial things and make extremely racist comments and call entire groups of people stupid or other negative things... \n\nIt's gotten worse in recent years and he has pretty much isolated himself from his friends and family by acting the way he does. It humiliates me when he erupts in the middle of somewhere we go and he believes that \"most people are self serving\" and that without acting that way, you are a doormat essentially. I've told him that treating people that way is unacceptable but he refuses to listen, and when I (as well as many many other family members) have suggested therapy, he vehemently refuses.\n\n He does not see anything wrong with his behavior and doesn't understand why people don't like him or invite him to things... I do not like going into public places with him or having him meet any of my friends or have anything to do with people and places that I value because I know he will do something to humiliate me like insult one of my friends or cause a scene in my favorite restaurant.\n\n I have considered cutting him completely out of my life but I'm really the only person he has left. He has been to therapy before for family reasons like marriage counseling when he and my mom were married and as part of the custody agreement, we had family counseling when I was a child. He quickly stopped attending both. I don't know how to get through to him that he needs help without him shutting down and ignoring me.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Could social media revolutionize democracy?\nPOST: Allow me to elaborate. I always thought that democracy, for all its wonders, is not really democratic. I had always understood that democracy is the rule of the many, but that rule ends with only a few choices, mainly conservative and liberal parties. But once the elections are over, we the people leave the politicians to their own devices and we get mad at them almost immediately.\n\nI always imagined something more efficient. A council of know-it-alls, scientists, business people, professionals, people who are leaders in their respective fields would be voted in by their respective communities. The council would be our government. But they do not dictate the law. Instead they would debate the issues and bring forward suggestions and possible new legislations and all that stuff to what I call a, or the, Collective Voice.\n\nWith the advent of social media and networking, the Collective Voice is us, the masses, the general public. We might get texts, emails, small little polls, whatever the medium, we'd get an interactive say in politics. In the same way we can choose to vote, we can choose to participate in these frequent specific votes. I'm sure the technicalities of such a system are not beyond our capabilities.\n\nIf it affects you personal you might feel compelled to vote in, if not, who gives a damn? If you're a heavy internet user, then laws that might affect your usage will be your main concern, if it's about immigration, perhaps not so much. In this way, a number of relevant voters will chime in and decide for the governing council. A middle department can take charge of interpreting the raw feedback from the people to present a final number that will dictate whether new laws come into effect.\n\nThe governing body, the council, and the country's most powerful individuals will all answer to the Collective Voice, the virtual embodiment of the general public. You would have no singular powerful people in politics, not on the Collective Voice's watch.\n\nWith no parties and no opposing sides in politics, this type of ad hoc government would do plenty of good, I think.\n\nAll hail the Collective Voice!\n\nWhat say you Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

We have been FWB's for the past half year. Last year, I saw him almost every day, since we went to the same school. I'd see him in passing between classes, and we'd hang out occasionally during the weekend and have fun. We'd text almost every day. No relationship ever came of it, and we both didn't want that, either.\n\nRecently, we got caught together when my parents snuck through my phone and read my messages, so we mutually agreed to stop texting each other.\n\nI love him as a friend and companion, but I know I would never date him because of certain personality aspects. I don't know if I mean as much to him as he does to me, because he would never admit anything like that unless he was in a relationship. However, I do know that I matter to him, just maybe not as much as he does to me. That's okay.\n\nBut, he's going to college next month, and I won't see him anymore except for **maybe** during breaks. Since we won't talk or see each other much anymore, is there a realistic way to maintain our friendship? We agreed to keep some distance for now, but said that once school starts again we could just shoot the other a text or call and catch up a bit.\n\nI know high school friendships rarely last through life, and I know we'll probably end up talking less and less until we're just strangers or acquaintances again. However, this makes me incredibly sad because I don't want to lose such a close friend. It feels like a friend \"break-up\" and I'm terrified of losing him; I always look back on people who used to be so close to me, and seeing how they mean nothing now hurts a lot.\nTL;DR:"}

I had a few dark thoughts of \"oh shes creating distance to break it off\", or \"she's giving you back clothes because she doesn't want to have your stuff when she ends it\" but I thought nothing of it.\n\nWhen I brought it up she took the fact that she was being distant and less affectionate kind of hard. She said her roommate had mentioned something to her about us as well. \n\nShe's working a ton, trying to start her own business, and in the process of moving so I get that she has a lot on her plate. This leads to little time for us. I made it clear that I wanted to support her through all of this and we would make up \"us time\" when we could.\n\nHer rebuttal was that it wasn't fair to me and it would actually make her feel horrible to just take what support I'm giving her with minimal love in return. So it basically ended in \"I love you, I want the best for you, I just hate thinking that I'm not giving you what you deserve.\"\n\nI'm torn.\n\nI want to believe that this is salvageable but I am really having trouble trusting in someone who I am deeply in love with, who is so readily able to let me go.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for almost 6 months. He gave me a whole wonderful speech and said some of the nicest things I'd ever heard anyone say about me before he professed it. I said I loved him back--but I didn't mean it. I was too chicken to tell the truth. Now I feel like I'm lying every time we exchange the words. \n\nHe's a nice guy, don't get me wrong. But I have often questioned our long-term future and though he makes me laugh and feel supported most times, I certainly can't label what I feel for him \"love\". And some of his hang-ups really bother me. (For instance, he spends a lot of time with friends, which I'm okay with, but not when he cancels on me for them.) \n\nI'm a horrible person, right? Has anyone been in my shoes? Is it okay to keep plugging along and hope that I eventually DO feel love for him? I didn't want him to feel unloved after everything he'd told me but I know how irresponsible it is to lie like this. I just need some advice or wisdom--or even criticism.\nTL;DR:"}

But we've always clashed when it comes to parenting choices. She gives my daughter fast food, soda, and used to put sugar and vanilla in her milk when she was an infant. Whatever, we resolved those issues. Her and I are very close. \n\nShe knows about the incidents where I was molested numerous times (one was from a family member) when I was a kid. So when she told me my daughter was sleeping in the same bed as her 12 year old son, it rubbed me the wrong way. He is a good kid and I know he loves my daughter very much, but I am not comfortable with my toddler sleeping in the same bed as an almost-teenager. I told her this and she got defensive about her son (which I can understand) and just disregarded my feelings. \n\nI haven't let my daughter sleep over since, because MIL said she can't guarantee where my daughter ends up falling asleep.

I don't know what to tell my family at this point, because I don't knew when I want to start trying.\n\nAlso, my family doesn't know about this, but my husband and I believe in sex only for procreation.  Yes, I know what birth control is and I recommend it to my patients, this is merely a matter of personal preference.  I bring this up because Im honestly a bit anxious about taking that step too, though I have no reason to be.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Freemium vs. paid\nPOST: So I'm developing an app I want to upload to the apple app store in a couple of weeks. The only thing is I haven't been able to settle the debate between freemium and paid in my mind. I was hoping Reddit could share it's opinions on the matter.\n\nI do indeed want to make money off of this app, ideally it would make enough money to justify further projects, if not then I would accept it and move on. I initially planned to release it as a 99 cent app, because although nifty, its pretty trivial and doesn't exactly save lives. I was also planning to release a free version as a proof of concept to show tentative purchasers that the app would indeed perform as advertised. However as I look at the app store I'm seeing a lot of apps adopting the in-app purchase model whereby you can buy individual items a la farmville and so many other \"casual\" games/apps. The thing is: I don't want to be THAT guy who nickel and dimes ya and I'm not sure if this makes a lot of sense business wise. The argument for a more featured free app with in-app purchases is greater word of mouth from people who would use the app but don't exactly pay for apps in the first place. Then some users might pay for 2 or 3 packs at 99 cents each which would be a better sales proposition for me. The against is that the core feature I would be leaving in the free app is the main draw and people would decide thats enough for them. Kind of like me and Pandora.\n\nOn the other hand I could just release everything onto one 99 cents app, but risk the app not getting any traction in a crowded marketplace. I've been toying with having it free for for a limited time and then having it go paid, but I can't seem to decide on what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

But I get these wild urges to be uncomfortable, and it is like I have a time limit.

Every day I'd begin the wake up process at 7:30 and remind him to get up every 10 minutes or so until he finally dragged himself out of bed after I started getting upset with him. My irritation seemed to be the only effective method of waking him. This started taking a toll on our relationship, it makes me feel like his mom, and I'm an early riser and an organized person, I'm never late, I never forget things at home, and he's the opposite, so it stresses me out to feel so disorganized. I should also note that we work for the same company which is why this is an issue. Otherwise I'd let him oversleep everyday and suffer the natural consequences at work. It's possible for me to drive to work separately but we take a toll bridge which costs about $6 a day. Close to $120 a month, a bill I'm not eager to double. \n\nI explained to him how I was feeling and he agreed to start setting an alarm and getting himself up. He was very sincere, apologized for stressing me out and said he would set an alarm. Well he forgot to set it or he wasnt setting it properly. After a few days of that I yelled at him and he got the picture and started double checking. Well now he's getting himself out of bed everyday. But only after hitting snooze ten times. So we're back at square one. I'm not getting him out of bed every day anymore, but I'm still stressed out because we're late everyday. \n\nI know that at least part of the problem is that he stays up too late playing Prison Architect and Kerbal, but could he have a legitimate sleep disorder? He snores heavily, I think because his allergies affect his breathing and occasionally suffers from night terrors. I'm going to feel like a shit head if he has a legitimate reason for not being able to get out of bed, but from where I'm sitting he just looks like he's not trying hard enough.\nTL;DR:"}

Had I not been there sticking up for him, they probably would have convinced him to call back his work and say he was wrong.  They yelled at him for about an hour over missing work, something that's not really even their business. They do this every time he makes a decision they disagree with and they continue to yell at him until he does what they want; and he always eventually does what they want. I also mentioned that he should probably quit his job since he didn't have time to do school full time while also taking 15 hours of classes. My parents were angry I suggested this and let me know that the reason they weren't letting him quit his job was because he has Aspergers and has to stick to a schedule. Personally I think that if a schedule is making you nearly fail your classes, then it's not a very good schedule but that's beside the point. For one, he shouldn't need permission at age 21 to quit his job. And also, I feel that the decisions they're making for him are letting his Aspergers define his life (they only want him in a job because schedules help him) rather than helping him work through his Aspergers to be successful and indipendent.\n\nI want to help my brother gain more control of his life. I'm not sure he even realizes that the amount of control they have over him isn't normal for people his age.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: In need of a \"charity party game\" as a replacement for the office Christmas party gift exchange game\nPOST: Every year our office does a gift exchange game at the staff Christmas party. Many of you probably know this game either from work (if you work at a small company) or family gatherings. The specific rules usually vary slightly, but it revolves around everyone bringing a generic gift and then taking turns taking a gift and unwrapping it. The \"fun\" comes in when you don't like what you opened, and are allowed to steal/swap your gift for someone else's gift they have already opened. If you were the one swapped with, you may accept the exchange or steal someone else's.\n\nThe problem is, while it can be fun, the same patterns emerge and it gets old after a few years. More importantly, since you are not buying gifts that are specifically suited for a particular person, it is inevitable that a good portion of people will not end up using or enjoying their gift anyway. Unfortunately this means wasting money, and creating physical waste (of course you can donate or re-gift later if it is not complete junk).\n\nSo I thought we could try something a bit different this year. My idea is that everyone contributes the money they would have spent on stuff, and then we donate all the money to a charity. But since we still want to do something fun at the Christmas party, I thought we could play a game where the winner gets to have the money go to the charity of their choice. I think this way we can do good with our money (Which I think is big part of the Christmas spirit) and we can feel good and have fun at the Christmas party doing it.\n\nEveryone seems onboard with this idea, so all that is left is to find a game that is fun to play and results in picking a charity. Maybe you have a game that your have played before that you can share. Or maybe you have a new unique idea. I feel like almost any party game where there is a single winner (or even teams) could be adapted for this. So please share your opinions on your favourite game that could work. But, I am also curious if there are any party games that are really well suited for picking charities and make a great replacement for the gift exchange game.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Where is the weirdest place you've ever had sex?\nPOST: Last summer, my current boyfriend and I had just gotten together and still in the honeymoon phase, were really horny. I still lived at home, and he was living at his grandparents' house for the summer so we were pretty limited in the privacy department. So we decided to get a little creative.  \nIt was a hot afternoon in August and we were driving around looking for a secluded place to do our thing. We found a car wash (right next to a major road *oh god why*) and parked next to the little vacuuming station. Trying to look like we were vacuuming the vehicle, my boyfriend stuck a hose into the driver's window and we quickly got down to business. We were getting pretty into it and were both stark naked. A woman pulls up to the vacuum next to us, and even though the windows were tinted she must have been curious because she tried to take a peak inside as my boyfriend was thrusting away. She leaves and we continue fucking.  \n \n10 minutes later, I see a police car parked right behind us. Yes, I was nervous the whole time but holy fuckadoodle doo-- **I realize I am in the back of a Honda CR-V, completely naked, with my boyfriend sat next to me with a semen-filled condom on his dick with a police officer staring at us.**  \nOk, like I said *luckily* the windows were tinted because in the time it took for the officer to walk up to the car, we both fumbled around to put our clothes back on.  \nHe came up to us and thought we were doing drugs and using the vacuum hose as a ventilating system. We told him we were doing no such thing and that we were just \"making-out\".  \nMaybe it was our raging hormones that possessed us to strip down and fuck in a car at a car wash but all I know that it was the weirdest place I've ever had sex and I don't regret it.\nTL;DR:"}

We have a very healthy drive and we have fun and always have mutual satisfaction. I would never pressure her into this and I am making sure to tell her this in every step.\nRecently she has been bringing up the idea of trying PIV and we have recently started having actual contact of genitalia, dry humping I guess.  We've never attempted it, but obvious in this position there is a lot of tensions and friction leaning towards that.  Once she asked to finger her when she was very relaxed and we had several hours of foreplay, it went really well, but we talked about it afterwards and decided to still take it slow with adding that to something that we normally do.\n\nWe find a lot of mutual pleasure in these acts, but recently I can tell she is disappointed that she cannot allow herself to to move any further. I let her know that I'm perfectly happy with our limits and that the ideas of causing her pain or making her uncomfortable are more than enough reasons for my understanding. I would be okay if she had no reasons.\n\nI guess ultimately my question is, I know that she knows that I not requiring us to move forward with any intercourse, but it seems like she genuinely wants to try. How can I make this process easier for her? Either letting her know that it is not something that I require in a relationship or steps to make intercourse easier.\n\nIf you need any more info or clarification let me know and I will do my best.\n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

Recently my parents booked a flight with Lufthansa but they booked the pet tickets for cargo.\nOne of my dogs is 6 kg, so I told them they should call lufthansa and tell them that one dog is going in cabin and the other one is going in cargo.\nThe problem is that the 6 kg dog is taller than what they allow to go in cabin- even though she is less than 8 kgs. I dont think this should be a problem because they are travelling in business class and I know they have more leg space, so a slightly bigger dog should be allowed if it is less than 8 kilos.\n\nMy concern is: if I call lufthansa, tell them my dog will be in cabin but then in the airport they think it is too big...can my dog still travel in cargo? or does she lose her booked place completely? If a dog is rejected for traveling in cabin, can it still go in cargo and can that change be made the same day of the flight?\nor do I need to know in advance if they dog will go in cabin or cargo? because I really cant know until the very day and Im anxious about it.\n\nI hope someone else who has had the same can enlighten me .

I really don't know where else to turn as I'm getting very different opinions on how to approach this situation...\nMy boyfriend is currently in Brazil, with his boss and another colleague on vacation. They were staying in Resplendor, Minas Gerais and were driving up to Porto Seguro in Bahia for Carnival. He did not buy a SIM card for his phone, but was in frequent touch last week via Viber and FaceTime. We last spoke Friday night before they began the 9 hour drive to Bahia and I have not heard from him since. While he is a little irresponsible at times, it is very uncharacteristic of him to not have touched base with me at this point to let me know they have all arrived. I understand that it is Carnival and there is a lot going on and that letting me know that he's safe if not a top priority, but by now I would like to think he would have a least managed to send me an email.\nIs it possible that he is unable to access any internet, even in a more touristy city? I would like to continue on thinking that no news is good news and that I would have heard something by now if he was hurt. His colleague uses \"whats app\" and was \"last seen\" the morning they left for the road trip as well.\nI'm aware this makes me sound naive and that he is perhaps just thoroughly enjoying Carnival, but I cannot impress enough that it is just not who he is to be out of touch this long.\nAny insight would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

We talked everyday. We admitted we liked each other. We were very much compatible in every way possible. He was every kind of my type, and was very affectionate. We were moving too fast. My parents and my friends said he looked like trouble and I should get out while it's still early. We went out on a date, sparks flew, we made out, and it was my first kiss. I've never felt happier with someone than with him during that time coz I've never had a serious boyfriend. A few days later he stopped talking to me. I'm devastated. I know it was a fling, and people who fall too easily fall out too easily too. I know he's not for me, but it hurts that things didn't end up the way I wanted them to. It hurts, and I want to get over it. Please help. I know it's dumb of me to feel bad about a fling that I expected to be more, but I feel really bad.

After those six workouts, I had a shin splint in my left leg, so I took a week off of running (I did continue yoga and strength training). Yesterday I went out for a run and ended up going for an hour because I felt really good, despite the nagging pain in my left shin Afterwards, I iced both my legs, elevated them, rehydrated and refueled, and did little walking for the rest of the night. I even slept with my left leg elevated (though when I woke up it was no longer elevated). This morning my leg feels like someone snapped it half and repaired it with paper clips or something.

A mutual friend had told me that she did the same thing to her last boyfriend (asking for space, saying that she wanted to get back together) but never did. This thought caused me to over-think even more and I felt utterly confused. So the following day, I asked my ex for some space, saying that I was going through some things.\n\nI quickly regretted it, I guess because of how foreign it felt and how I didn't fully understand the meaning of space until it was given to me. I tried talking to her 2 days after I asked for space to swallow my pride and ask for my friend back. But when I sat down with her to tell her, we kept being interrupted and I guess that point never got across. I feel so awkward with her now, since I see her everyday. \n\nI want to be on good terms with her, but I don't know how to get out of \"space\" and how to mend a friendship. She's a great person and I'd rather have a friend than no one at all. I just don't know what to do... \nAny advice would be very helpful, thank you for your time!\nTL;DR:"}

Am I doing something wrong?\nPOST: Last december I purchased a ticket to surprise my girlfriend in NYC a few days before Christmas. Unfortunately my plans were ruined by an accident where my hand was severely cut when I fell on a glass and had to have immediate surgery. The original ticket was purchased on october 11th of 2011 and was for Dec 22 through Jan 2. I would have spent Christmas and New Year's with her. Due to the accident I had to cancel my flight and was promised a 322.08 credit for a new flight. I called orbitz a few minutes ago and was told that I had to pay a 180 dollar change fee and the travel had to be completed before October the 10th of 2012. My new plans were to go to NYC Comic Con which is the 12th - 14th. I asked if I could just book a one way flight and take a 150 dollar hit since I cancelled before. They said that on top of the new ticket fee, I had to pay an additional 180 dollars for the change. Am I asking the wrong questions? can someone explain this to me? Im so pissed off right now I can feel the heat in my face and can't think straight >.<\nTL;DR:"}

The next year, I joined the same university and it has gone smoothly until now.  I will be the first to admit that he isn't the nicest person to me, but I have to admit that compared to other people I've dated, he is the nicest.  and don't worry, I am not being physically hurt, just slightly emotionally.  \n\nSo, maybe in the past four or five months we have been having less and less sex.  I guess that is okay, except for the fact that he constantly watches porn.  It is stored on his computer's hard drive and he has at least five different porn sites, not including r/gonewild and things here on reddit.  He doesn't compliment me anymore on my looks, but comments on how attractive other girls are.\n\nNow that we have that covered, we can look at other things.  I am not allowed to touch his phone or his computer.  I don't know why he wont let me, and I don't want to ask.  I think that he might be hiding something, but I don't want to ask.\n\nThe other day, there was something about the app \"MeetMe\" that popped up on facebook and linked back to his account.  Now, I might just be over reacting, but I think it is a legitimate concern.\n\nDo you think that there could be an underlying problem with him lying/not telling the whole truth?  I am so hurt by the thought of him emotionally cheating on me that I deny it.  Thanks in advance for any help or advice that you have.\nTL;DR:"}

Her mother and herself said I can move in with her family, but I don't want to do that, as it feels like and obligation and her family doesn't have that much money. I am going to dorm there at the Unv now, but I have no problem with this, as it sounds exciting.. however.. It sounds like its a break up as soon as I move over, as shes back with her family. I have already braced myself on a possible break up, for this situation because I try to plan ahead as much as possible. Our sex life has indeed dropped because of it. I'm trying to re spark it, but I fear she's no longer interested. \n\nAm I loosing my mind? Im still in a lease with apartment with her till..

We've been a couple for well over a year now, but her parents only found out about half a year ago and she told them (originally, when they knew we had been seeing each other but thought we were friends) that I used to go to one of her old schools as a child, as opposed to how we really met, on the internet. The reason for this is how strict and protective her parents are of her, and how much they dislike her interacting with people from the internet.\n\nHer brother, who knows about most of the stuff and is cool with it, allowed her to invite me to his wedding which will be in October, however her parents want to meet me first, in the summer or something. Her parents are almost definitely going to ask me about growing up in their town, and knowing their daughter in school, which means we're going to have to tell them that we met online and that we've been together for over a year. They'll find out that she's been lying to them all this time, and that I'm not entirely who they thought I was.\n\nI would be surprised if both her mum and dad were okay with it, it seems like her dad is already unhappy about meeting me and definitely about the idea of me staying over, if I go to her brother's wedding.\n\nJust to clarify why my girlfriend lied about me in the first place, had her parents known we've only spoken over the internet they would not have let her meet me in person, let alone be in a relationship with me.

It's no specific person, just a collection of idea about how the perfect girl and all the fun things we'd do together that for whatever reason me and my current girlfriend aren't doing.

I found a basic contract template online and just basically filled in my information, his information, car, make, model, price and etc.  \n\nSo all is good up until two weeks ago...\nHe calls me and says that there's a mistake.  The contract says that he has to make 33 payments of $370 at an interest rate of 12% but when calculating it, the final number is much higher than expected.  \n\nHe says that he's only supposed to be paying 33 payments equaling to $12210 and there shouldn't be an extra $4k left from interest.  We went back and forth for a bit then I realized that I did not calculate interest and take in account that he's taking over my original loan (interest is calculated from my original loan amount therefore the remaining amount on the loan is higher).\n\nSo now he's saying that I'm screwing him over but all I wanted was to get out of my loan and basically help him out because he couldn't qualify for a loan himself.  I even let him onto my insurance policy so it's cheaper for him!  \n\nI told him that when he got into this agreement, we verbally agreed that he would be taking over my payments.

I'm medicated, and am very self aware and rational most of the time and do try quite hard to manage my issues. \n\nBasically I got it into my head that my boyfriend was going to break up with me one night. He was out and I was suddenly worried and it snowballed until I was crying and being completely pathetic. I went onto his social media and checked his messages to try and find some reassurance so I didn't have to phone him while he was out with friends. I found a message in which he was telling someone that \"all women suck\" and I felt the need to inquire of the context right away. It turned out to be irrelevant to me. And now it is a month down the line and he is still furious that I went through his messages. \n\nI've apologized, tried to explain how my anxiety manifests while still taking responsibility but he says he doesn't think he can get past this. He wants to work on us but as it stands there is admittedly a huge possibility that he is going to break up with me. \n\nI feel completely broken. I don't know how many more days I can go to work not knowing. This is the only person I've ever properly pictured a future with, and it was up until now, the best relationship I've ever been in. I don't know how I can get his trust back. He says there isn't a way for me to fix this. I know that what I did was wrong, but I really want to get past it. I don't even know if I want advice. I'm lost. I've been crying constantly and can't concentrate on anything. I just need this to work. I need someone to tell me what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

So I'm going to try and make this as quick and painless as possible and give you the cliff-notes version of the whole situation. Girlfriend lost her feelings for me over the course of the past month before our breakup three weeks ago but is adamant about remaining friends. Initially, I was hesitant, however, over the past couple weeks I see a glimmer of hope. With that said, I believe we both are struggling with situation that we both share two of the same classes (community college) and general group of friends (Initially her group of friends who over the time of our relationship became my friends as well). In addition, we both remain friends on social media such as Facebook and Snapchat which has definitely not helped the cause of getting over one another I think from both sides. I'm just trying to reconcile how much contact is too much at least on my end. Thanks!\n\nP.S. I also know that no contact is a highly praised practice in this sub but I have no idea how I that would possibly work in our situation (at least for a initial period).\nTL;DR:"}

She is beautiful, smart, kind, and everything I ever dreamed of in a partner. We are best friends as well, and she has helped me through a LOT. She helped me learn how to express my emotions instead of bottling them up and eventually exploding, which allowed me to actually feel happiness and joy, leading me to quit drugs and smoking since I only used those things to fill the emptiness I felt inside. My life story aside, I love her more than anything, and I can really myself growing old with her, and being by her side for the rest of our lives together. She feels the same way, and everything is happy.\n\nWe are both grade 12 in Australia, and we graduate high school at the end of this year. We both want to get into medicine, which is pretty damn hard to do. The chances of us getting into the same university among the few with undergraduate medicine in Australia is very low, let alone both getting into universities at the same city. I know there are post-graduate medicine options available, so if only one of us got into undergraduate medicine, the other would simply go to the same university and do an undergrad in another major, because we both get good enough grades to easily get into any other major at any university in Australia. The issue is if we both were to get into medicine in different cities, how would we make long distance work? The general consensus on reddit seem to be that they NEVER work and are extremely emotionally draining. In such a situation, should I just give up going in undergraduate medicine and follow my girlfriend? The thing is, I know I'm only 17, and I don't want to live with resentment towards my girlfriend if that wasn't the right decision. I also don't want to be seperated from my girlfriend, because she is the girl I want to marry. Then other concerns, like the slight possibility that we may break up, which would make this all for nothing. How do I even come about making such life decisions like this?\nTL;DR:"}

I was worried this was done fraudulently because I do have a Verizon account for my cell phones.\n\nThe first thing I did was call Verizon to check that it wasn't something fraudulent.

He was very controlling of her and a complete dick. About a month and a half after he dumped her, we started dating. It was clear to everyone we were better together. However when school started we started to fall apart as well. Her friends hate me, and according to her they come before me in about everything. I put up with this for a while, until she started to take advantage of me and we started to fall apart. She wouldn't talk to me around her friends, I felt completely excluded. I brought it up to her and she told me that we shouldn't be cuddly in school. I agreed, but then she started to pull away even more. Kissing was off limits. Making out was unheard of. In fact if i put my arm around her at the wrong time she would throw it off. It pissed me off but I kept my calm because I'm a nice guy and i respect her feelings. She continued to abuse this power until last weekend when I made plans with her and she went and asked her friends to hang out on the same day. I told her to cancel with her friends.

I'll suck it up and just do it if I have to, and I'll act happy, but it'll be miserable for me. \n\nNot belittling anyone who has been a Man of Honor, I just will be incredibly nervous the whole time and feel like I will be a bit useless.\nTL;DR:"}

Essentially, they have said their policy is to ignore the losses and rather to just focus on the assets and income (despite tax returns showing my parents limited income). In addition, I have loan documentation and even a forbearance agreement that my parents have filed. I have repeatedly told them all this, but it almost seems like advisor is going straight by the book/equation. Should I try to contact someone above him or perhaps bring all of this in and try to explain this to him in person? I have also considered contacting my area's congressman. Honestly, the financial aid department has not even offered loans or anything, they have blatantly said that the parental contribution will be nearly the entire amount of cost. This is impossible for our family, as our income is middle class with all the costs that come with it (in America) and cannot afford 60k a year.

He frames all of this as trying to make her happy because she \"seems sad\" (though she's not, she's just uncomfortable when he's around).\n\nAbout a month ago he started coming to me to ask about how she is, to which I reply with \"I don't know, I'm busy right now.\" While I was waiting for my friend after class recently he came over and wanted to know if I was \"feeling ok\". I replied with a curt \"I'm fine\" to avoid the inevitable friend-inquiry. He messaged me with the almost word-for-word same message he usually sends my friend, just with the details changed. He also sent me a video of bear cubs because I was \"sad after class\".\n\nI'm worried that he's transferring/extending his stalker-ish tendencies to me since this is about how he started with my friend.

I had a pretty rough time switching gears for senior year out of nowhere. When my (now) boyfriend started talking to me, I latched on to him as a friend. From the beginning, I didn't feel sexually attracted to him. \n\nFast forward a year, and now we've been together this entire time. I love him a whole lot (as much as an 18 year old can), and can't imagine not being with him. We have had sex, but nothing I do with him makes me heart pound or my palms sweaty.

Not quite the tinglings that you get when your hands fall asleep, but more like if you were to touch a piece of electrical equipment that isn't properly grounded. After about 2 minutes of this it began to get worse and worse and my hands slowly began to seize up. The fingers were stuck outstretched and began to push in against each other (sort of like the Death Touch from Kill Bill). It wasn't exactly painful, but the buzzing was very intense. It was to the point that I had to lay down to stop from freaking out. \n\nMy wife massaged my lower arms and I'm not sure if that made a difference or not. It took about five to eight minutes before the buzzing feeling began to subside and I was able to control a few of my fingers a little bit. About 3 minutes after that complete control returned and it was as if nothing had happened.\n\nI'm certain that over extending myself in the jog caused my hands to seize up like this, but any advice about what I may have specifically done wrong would be amazing.

I got to a crossroads and had a choice to leave her or not but I loved this person and wanted to marry her, again, so I was stupid and stayed with her. Come a year later and I just started to trust her but I noticed she had literally zero interest in doing anything at all with me. During that time, though, I got her a job where I work because it was more pay and I was under the impression that we would finally move out, be happy and start a family. I have heavy abandonment issues from my father and I told her multiple times, if you are going to leave me for someone else, then leave me and just tell me.

They \"dated\" for six months, but she didn't really like him for a long portion of the relationship, so she tells me. My brother suspects both of us of liking each other and has basically encouraged me to ask her out, and I've recently learned that basically everyone I know wants me to ask her out as well. Even my parents have encouraged me to, without me ever divulging explicitly to anyone that I like this girl. I guess it's obvious. She's super oblivious to everything so I doubt she has figured it out (I mean she cannot pick up on hints or even sarcasm), but basically my only reservation is that she would think it's weird because of my brother. He's pretty much moving out soon. \nFurther complications! She has a twin [16f] who's like really gender/sexuality confused, and who asked me out at one point. So like, both of us have weird sibling things which might make dating kind of weird. We also happen to be pretty much best friends, have been for a year or two now, and I'm a bit worried that if I divulge to her that I like her, she might think the friendship was due mostly to attraction, which is very much not the case. I'm totally open to being just friends, but I'd like to know if there is a prospect of a relationship on her end. How do I go about this?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, what's the best way to break out of the \"friend zone\"?\nPOST: Here's the backstory. There's a girl that I work with that I've ended up becoming really interested in, but I'm not sure what I should do to break out of the \"friend zone\" with her. We've only known each other for a few months, and we've grown really close over the time that we've known one another. We have a ton in common, and whatever we don't we love debating about it (foundation of a healthy relationship, if you ask me). Holy hell, just last night I went over to her place and we played Crash Team Racing and Tetris Plus, watched a movie, and never had a dull or awkward moment. I look for the signs that she may be interested (unnecissary physical contact, playing with her hair, body language, etc.) and those signs tell me she's down. But the next moment, she'll snuggle up to me and say she's glad she has \"such a good friend\". So I just don't know what to think, and I think I may have fucked myself over by joking and telling her \"you're too young for me\" when we first met (she's 20, I'm 27.) I don't know what to do, and it's more sensitive of a situation than just \"going for it\". We do work together, after all. I'd prefer shit not getting awkward if I misread her. Any advice on the matter would be extremely appreciated. Thank you!\nTL;DR:"}

He says he loves his animals, but the conditions that he keeps them in are substandard, from my perspective. \n\nNone of the cats and dogs are spayed/neutered. He says he's waiting while he \"decides which ones he's going to keep\". He's been \"deciding\" since March of last year. Meanwhile, the cats breed however they please and dozens of kittens go off to the pound in the spring. The dogs are not on heartworm preventative. They are hosting all sorts of parasites. Both dogs are morbidly obese and have their mobility limited because of it. One dog has a pretty serious skin condition that he won't do anything about because \"she doesn't like going to the vet\". Because the animals are overpopulated, they get sick and die, no vet care. \n\nThe conditions that he lives in himself are substandard to my perspective, also. The place seems filthy and covered in bugs to me. He gets defensive if I say anything about it. \n\nAm I a judgey bitch or is it time to call someone? I know times are hard and it's a hard thing for me to impose my middle-class living standards on someone else. Also, he has an intellectual disability. I think he is genuinely unable to understand that living like this is bad for himself and his animals. \n\nNB: This situation is in the United States, state of Georgia.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel so trapped.\nPOST: Last September I started dating a guy, long distance (he was in New York, and I in California).  In February, I found out I was pregnant.  He said he would support whatever decision I made, and I decided I wanted to keep the baby and continue living in California, for at least another year.  So in June, he moved out here, and things have been downhill ever since, fighting (verbally) all the time.  We fought the night before my water broke, but he was there to bring me to the hospital and throughout labor.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, since the birth of our daughter, things have not improved between us.  He treats our daughter quite well, and he pays the rent and food, but we have realized that we have very different and conflicting expectations in a partner.\n\nI would be inclined to keep trying and/or seek counseling, but he is simply no longer interested in nor sexually attracted to me.  It's a tough pill to swallow, and I am increasingly more unhappy cohabitating with him, especially given the way he feels.  He spends several hours a day playing video games and surfing the internet, while I am juggling breastfeeding, diapering and mealmaking.  I want to move back to my old place (which I own), but he says that while I am free to go, our daughter must stay with him.  She is only 3 months, and I would like to continue breastfeeding her for at least a year, but it is so emotionally draining to be around her father--I still love him, and it just hurts to be around his indifference toward me, especially in the face of his love of our daughter.\n\nThe last thing I want is to get the law involved.

I'll keep my reasoning for breaking up brief, as it's a lot of small and some medium sized things, but my heart is just not in the relationship anymore. It's as simple as that and that's the reasoning I'm planning on giving her. I was planning on telling her after I drop her off at the train station because I wanted to give myself one more weekend to absolutely make sure that's what **I** want (also the timing would feel weird to say I'm going to pick her up at work on Friday, breakup, and send her back to the train station).\n\nSo here's the wrinkle. She had breast implant surgery last Thursday (Feb 18), and since she is a transwoman, she was also off her hormone treatment for a few weeks (although she is back on them, she warned me she might be extra emotional during that time). She might also be experiencing post-surgery depression (I seriously did not know that was a thing before this morning). She's in a state where she needs me to be emotionally supportive, and here I am planning on doing the exact opposite.\n\nSo reddit, here I am. Do I still breakup with her on Sunday? I'm travelling for business the next two weekends, so I won't see her until March 18th and feels wrong to continue for that long if I'm not interested.

Do I have a claim?\nPOST: First, a bit of backstory:\n\nA few months ago I boarded a plane (in Maryland) for the first time. Because of the narrow leg space, my foot got caught on my way to my seat and I heard a crunch in my knee followed by severe pain. During the flight, the attendants were busy with a lady who had a seizure. As I was getting off of the plane in Illinois, the same thing happened. The crunch, the pain, but I could walk so I hoped it was nothing. The attendants hurried everyone off, after helping paramedics get the lady out, and I was on my way.\n\nThe next day my knee was very swollen, I couldn't straighten it and walking and standing was difficult. I decided to go to the ER. I told them how it happened and they took an x-ray. They couldn't tell me much other than it might be just a simple strain or it could be something more but I'd have to have an MRI when I got home. \n\nLong story short, MRI confirms that I have a torn meniscus. \n\nJust recently, I got a letter in the mail because my insurance company has turned the original claim over to The Phia Group. They want to determine who is liable for paying the bill.\n\nI didn't realize this was a potential issue against the airline, but I believe this company is opening an investigation for subrogation. Is that something I should look into or is my insurance company just checking all of its bases? \n\nWhat does subrogation mean for me? Should I contact a lawyer? I'm only asking because this will require surgery at some point and I need my insurance to cover it.\nTL;DR:"}

Yeah, I sexted.\n\nFast forward: my husband found out and is very hurt. I, on the other hand, became somewhat addicted to the attention I was getting from much younger men. I then set up fake email accounts and posted personal ads and even met two guys for lame hook ups (basically making out in a car).\n\nI realize all of the above could probably be symptoms of depression or seeking a new connection or something, and I'm making efforts to find a therapist to talk to about it. But it's led to the bigger question: do I still want to be married? Am I even cut out for marriage?\n\nI miss living alone.

There is no way of getting her to introduce me (which is also a bit weird in our circle of friends), I can't casually add her on facebook or anything, and also, I have no clue if the chances of me getting to know her are ZERO due to me and Lisa, or if she is not bothered by it.

We both come from the products of divorce and both have children from our previous relationships and got the bitter ends of the divorce. \n\nThis year has honestly been amazing for us both and she tells me that I have been the most sweetest and caring man that she has been with and that she loves me. \n\nIt wasn't until a few months ago where her depression started to consume her. When she has a depression episode, she gets in a really bad funk and pushes me away. She and I have always had good communication and we have never had any issues like this until the first episode she had which was about four months ago; shortly after she found out she was miscarrying our baby.

She told me she feels terrible for all of this and that she still loves me and that she broke up with me solely for the purpose of her taking time for herself and to get help. \n\nNow, I love this girl very much. We have been there for each other in these times of need and I want her to get better so she can find her way; I just hurt from it all because we were fine and then she sunk into this funk, resulting in me moving out and back into my mom's house. \n\nI feel extremely conflicted in this scenario.

Call it alexithymia if you will.  I just don't know how I feel.  Right now I'm single.  I've had 3 relationships lasting approximately 1-2 years each.   I wouldn't say I'm a bad person but I always secretly sort of questioned if I loved them.  I liked their company but frankly 2/3 relationships ended on not so good notes.  One of the guys I had broken up with twice because I felt bad about 'not liking him enough' and frankly I think I mistook love for friendship.  I felt guilty.

Another guy was really complicated... long story short, he was a douche.  Anyway recently I also experienced a 'best friend' breakup.  I thought I would have felt way more but nope, life didn't end and all is good.   This being said, looking at all of this, deep down if I really think about it, I'll start to miss them and figure I probably threw out good relationships but its like I can't commit to anything... and those feelings of regret/longing mostly happen when I'm bored if I'm being honest, which probably make me a horrible person.

She was rather inexperienced, and because of that, very vanilla, and still is. I've been around a little more and also I believe I have a much higher libido than her. She is and has been my best friend the entire time and we have lived together for almost 2 years. Over the last half year or so, our sex life has drastically dwindled. \n\nNow recently, we have sex about once every 10 days, and its always kind of short (she will become sore or we both just get tired, often neither of us finishing). It seems like we have little to no romance anymore, and its putting a strain on our relationship. \n\nWe both work a lot and go to school so we just see each other at night when we both get off work. We watch Netflix and fall asleep and neither of us ever is in the mood to have sex. Also she never masturbates which I find weird. I got her an njoy wand and she has used it once and that was with me asking her to use it. \n\nI realize its not one of our faults, but rather something we both need to work on. Sex is extremely important to me and I think she could take it or leave it.\n\nIs there use in trying to make it work and bring back our sex life? Or am I too young to be struggling with intimacy issues in a relationship?\n\nThank you in advance for your responses, and let me know if there is anything I can answer\nTL;DR:"}

Day 1, was yesterday, I was excited to go to Washington D.C. to be in the annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle parade.  This was my first time ever and was on my bucket list ever since I purchased my motorcycle.  We leave at 0800 in the morning and arrive at the parking lot at 1000, not bad as the parade starts around 1200.  I go around and look at bikes, estimated 600,000, but to my dismay they are mostly black Harleys.  I found out we are in the last overflow lot so we are able to watch the start and then walk back to our lot to get ready.  One the ten minute walk was over I sat in/near my bike until we were ready to go...... three hours later (spongebob voice over)...... I am more red than a freshly cooked later.... mistake one....\n\nNote today I volunteered to help with an elementary 1k/5k fun run.  I helped direct the runners on certain areas of the track, they even have me a bright flag to look official!  As I am waiting on the race to start the nats begin attacking.  I know, I will use the flag and wave it around my head to keep them away.  About my third wave I flick the flag back and just like a wet towel it makes a loud **CRACK** , only it makes contact with my burnt, crispity, crackly forehead.  I feel like an idiot and I can't run my head due to the tight, burnt skin that feels as though it is on fire if you when look at it wrong......\nTL;DR:"}

We met in high school, and everything was great from there on. In the beginning she was so affectionate so different in a good way from the way she is now. This was the case for about 2 years and then something changed. After she started college and working she just changed, she gets upset with me far quicker, we fight more often and she just seems all around more different. The affection that was there before is rarely ever there. When were alone she's different in a better way than if we're together with friends or family. She behaves less affectionate around them except this wasn't always the case. For the first two years she was affectionate both in front of friends and family and when we were alone together. I don't know what happened. I know I'm no saint and I've changed as well but I feel as though my changes were in reaction to hers. I have tried discussing this with her and she just began to cry and guilt me that I was \"finding faults\" with her. \n\nWhat I don't know is , did I change? Is there something else I should I be looking for? Is our relationship doomed? \n\nI always intended marrying the woman I love, and for a long time I was with her - but it feels like in the last two years he has changed a lot and is no longer the kind of person I fell in love with. \n\nYet If I'm the problem I'm willing to improve myself or my attitude in order to make this work.

I've heard he has a crush on me so I know he likes me at least to some degree. But gosh, when he looks at me I get so tense. It's crazy. I just need to know, has this happened to anyone else!? I feel totally psycho for this fixated crush but I just need some stories from others to read or reassurance that I'm not just some crazy person. Also side-note, even with hearing about his less than favorable reputation, I still like him after everything! So there's that haha.\nTL;DR:"}

(more inside)\nPOST: Dear Reddit,\n\nI moved from Denver, CO back to the east coast in June 2012. I went to a nearby Office Depot to send a lot of my stuff back in boxes. For whatever reason, some boxes went through UPS Ground and some went through USPS. Apparently the label on one box became separated from the box itself and USPS asked me for info on the lost box: what was in it, size, etc. Luckily I have the exact dimensions, contents, and weight of the box, so you'd think they would be able to find it, right? WRONG\n\nLast I heard the box is in some warehouse in Atlanta, GA where all the naked boxes sans labels go. It have followed up, send in numerous forms with the box info/contents and called. I don't know what else to do! The box was full of books, one of which was signed by one of my favorite authors Julia Alvarez :( Any ideas? I would be forever grateful. Thank you for your time.\nTL;DR:"}

We met at a camp in Boston (neither of us are from there). After the camp we just kind of kept talking and decided to try dating long distance. While I now realize that was stupid, to be fair she was really hot, at the time I didn't care. We talked on the phone all the time and we even visted each other a few times. I was her first , but she wasn't mine. We broke up after 6 months and never talked again. I think if we lived in the same place it could have been more, but it was doomed from the beggining. Fast forward to now, last time I was back home and getting some stuff together to take back to my apartment I cam across this box that had stuff from when we were dating. I was feeling nostalgic and looked her up and found her. I haven't talked to her since because I have no clue what to say to her. I don't want to date her again but I just want to talk to her. How do I approach that?\nTL;DR:"}

How can I overcome this, and let my partners know about it in a way that doesn't cause them to run for the hills?\nPOST: I have always had anxiety, but I've noticed that my anxiety exponentially increases when I'm dating. When seeing a guy, even after seeing him many times, my mind goes blank- I become meek and shy, and I am not fun to be around. I sound stupid and just become overwhelmed by the anxiety, and by the end of the night I've shut down. I've tried deep breathing but my mind is still on overload. Sometimes I'll \"ride\" the anxiety and become overly enthusiastic and my mind will race out loud when I'm talking to the guy. My poor behavior makes me feel bad and thus I become evasive about scheduling plans and stuff. \n\nI thought about it and I think the root of it as it relates to dating, is that I'm very worried about rejection. I feel like every sentence that comes out of my mouth is \"wrong\" - based on feedback I've gotten on sites like this and in person, like \"saying things like I miss you will scare him away\" or \"don't talk about your problems- be vulnerable - but don't tell him why he shouldn't date you.\"\n\nI'm otherwise a normal person and I do like myself. I just feel like this anxiety is ruining my life. \n\nThings I've tried unsuccessfully: \n* regular yoga\n* breathing\n* meditation\n\nMy problem I think is from my underlying mentality of fear of walking on eggshells given the negative feedback I've gotten about how I act. Can someone please help me overcome this? Also, how can I share my anxiety problem with a partner without scaring him away?\nTL;DR:"}

All of our waste goes into something called a septic tank which I don't know anything about so don't ask me about it, I'm only 16. \n\nSo maybe a few months in to moving I have one of the wettest dumps of my life. I'm talking more water than shit came out. I used up about a half a roll. Well the next day I come home from school and let my dogs out (I have two). After about three minutes they haven't come back in so I have to go outside and drag them back in. They smell absolutely awful and for some reason I didn't think anything about it. So the day continues on and my parents come home and they say hi to the dogs and the dogs kiss them and my parents kiss them back. They also smell the god awful smell and this goes on for maybe three days before my parents start to finally inspect it. They go outside to see where the dogs keep going when we let them out. Apparently our septic tank broke from all the toilet paper I used. So every time someone took a dump in my family it would go up into our backyard. If you haven't already realized our dogs have been eating our shit and then licking us when they came inside. My dad actually vomited and I was traumatized. We had to set fences around the area because our dogs were addicted. They'd always go over there when they were let outside. We had to wait for a plumber to come and fix everything before we could take away the fence.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, what do you think of my theory of the \"afterlife\"?\nPOST: There have been many statements made suggesting the notion that the brain is capable of living on for approximately 7 minutes after your heart stops and you are pronounced \"dead\". Taking this theory into account, I have devised my own theory on the \"afterlife\" and what becomes of us when we die.\n\nDuring this seven minute period in which your brain is still living and your heart has stopped you would be in a lucid coma-like state and condemned to your thoughts and memories. Not necessarily knowing that you are on your way out, the old \"life flashing before your eyes\" phenomenon occurs.\n\nMy theory is that during this seven minute time frame, your conscience takes hold of your mind subliminally and depending on the way that you lived your life and what choices you made you either have a good or bad manifestation inside your head. Very similar to a nightmare, or the opposite, a \"good\" dream. If you have a clear and pure conscience and you have lived a wholesome life, your last 7 minutes will be manifested with everything you have ever desired (heaven). If you have lived an evil life, your manifestation will reflect as such. Simply put, you make your own hell. There is no divine intervention, no heavely father. None of that is real. You manifest your own destiny in that 7 minute window that your brain lives on. The best part is that if you manifest your \"heaven\" then everything you want is yours and you never have to wake up to find that you couldn't keep the things you've found in your dreams. The worst part is if you're braindead, you're stuck. You become a lost soul. Condemned to wander aimlessly searching for your last dream forever.\nTL;DR:"}

She suggested that I go back into the dating pool, go on a few more dates and see if there is someone else that I click with. She wanted to keep dating, but wanted me to explore more girls to see if I also like someone else. Her reasoning was that our relationship is going really, really well (based on her previous experiences) and she doesn't want to be hurt later on if I don't actually like her. She said that she doesn't want me to regret not being with anyone else and start to resent her for that after a like six or so months.

He is extremely physically attractive and he tells me I'm the most beautiful girl he's dated. However if he tells me about girls checking him out I get scared. I sometimes get nervous that he's just going to realize he misses other girls and leave me. I have been worried for months and it still hasn't come true. He loves me and is my best friend. He tells me I'm his best friend too. \nI just feel I'm not good enough. I feel my boobs are too small or I'm only one girl why does he want me or my skin isn't perfect or etc. I find a new reason all the time and sometimes my insecurities come out into a heated discussion (we never yell) about something that upsets me but it shouldn't. His actions always prove how much he loves me, but if he says anything that accidentally plays into an insecurity, I internally freak out and sometimes I express it to him. \nHe is my first good experience with a man, my dad was emotionally abusive and my first three boyfriends/flings hurt me. \n\nHe deserves better than to be doubted. I am in therapy for an anxiety disorder and depression. \n\nBasically I just want to know how to stop being so insecure even when all logic tells me he chose me over everyone else and continues to stay with me.\nTL;DR:"}

I went through my usual routine of washing my hair, cleaning my body, and pretending to be a water bender. When I was done I turned around to turn off the water, and I stepped on a bar of soap. I slipped and fell back into the temperature gauge and the faucet. I ripped both completely off (I'm 5'10 185 lbs.). I crawl out of the shower, and look in the mirror at my back. I have a large gauge going down my back, and a few scratches. I turn back to the bathtub and water was spraying everywhere. I run downstairs and find water coming out of the wall and ceiling that are under the bathroom. I panic and run to the basement to turn off the water. When I get their, I realize I don't remember to turn off the water. My neighbor heard me screaming \"fuck, fuck, fuck.\" So he comes over to help (and I had put on shorts and a shirt by this time). He helped me turn off the water, and my dad took me to redi-med. I got stitches, some Vicodin, and a shamrock shake. All in all, it wasn't that bad.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Is it okay to give weight-loss related relationship advice here?\nPOST: I was reflecting upon my life experiences earlier and thought of one that I would really like to share and put some advice out there in the hopes that it helps someone. \n\nAs you all know, weight loss and fitness is a very personal journey. Many people are overweight because of events in their lives that they have not dealt with, as was my case. I was in the \"bulking\" stage of my life when I met my then boyfriend. I was hurting from a very negative part of my life, and the healing process was very slow. My fitness and weight were tied to the healing process.\n\nI started dating a person who wanted to help me through. Which sounds great, right? Here's what I should have seen as a red flag. He was okay with dating me at my high weight for the time being, but I had to be actively working on it or else I would lose his interest.\n\n This led to me trying to rush my healing and the rest of my journey to fitness in order to keep his favor and keep to his schedule of what HE thought I should be losing. Of how hard HE thought I should be working. It became very stressful and honestly abusive. He would hold it over my head. \n\nI felt like I was broken and wasn't worth anyone else's time, and was grateful for the \"opportunity\" for love and acceptance that I was *so graciously* gifted. A lot of this low self worth was tied to my weight, so I tried to jump as high as he told me as fast as he told me, whether it was really healthy or not. \n\nI've been out of that relationship for a while now, and I want to stress to all of you that YOUR JOURNEY IS YOUR OWN, NOONE ELSE'S. You don't have to conform to another person's schedule. You move along at your own pace, and don't ever let anyone make you feel ashamed of yourself. Watch out for people who are \"accepting of your weight for now,\" because they may have a timeline for your weightloss, and that's just not healthy. Love and respect yourself yourself, because it took me a long time to, and I regret it.\nTL;DR:"}

He's never taken any drugs and although he drinks some alcohol now, he's never gotten drunk.\n\nHe admitted that he regrets not doing stupid things when he was younger and had the chance, his \"college years\".

What I'm saying is, I guess, that I enjoyed mine and I don't want to deny my boyfriend his. It took me a while to accept it and I'm not exactly comfortable with it, but I want him to have his experience.\n\nSo I basically told him I don't mind if he goes around drinking and doing drugs and having casual sex as long as he follows a few rules (be safe, don't tell me about any of it, don't let if affect your worklife, nothing emotional, etc).\n\nHe said he didn't want to. I know he definitely wants to: admitted he regrets he didn't do it. I think he's just saying he doesn't because he doesn't want to hurt me. But, the thing is, his happiness is important to me.

I am deeply in love with him but lately his actions make me welcome the thought of breaking up. When it comes to it though I cant seem to break it off so I really want to know if there is any way we can get back to a healthy relationship.\nA couple of months ago he asked me if I had feelings for a mutual friend and I told him I didn't. He started to call me a liar and say that he catches me staring at him because I probably feel flattered that he shows interest in me. We don't get to see this friend much anymore so now he has moved on to saying the exact same thing about another mutual friend. I don't even think mutual friend is the appropriate word to describe them. I think acquaintance is better because my conversations with either of these guys has never gotten past \"Hey how are you?\" \nI feel like the only thing I can do is tell him that he's the only one I want to be with because that's the truth. His response to that is he knows I'm not perfect and he can't believe that I've never talked (romantically) with anybody else during our relationship. I have given him permission to go through my phone and all of my social media and when he finds nothing he says that's not enough because I can delete things.\nI have no idea how to get through to him and as I'm typing all of this out I'm getting more and more scared that I'll never be able to get through.

However, he has dropped many many signs of having feelings for me, and I'm not sure what to make of it.  \n\n* We always have witty, \"flirty\" banter.\n* He has continually brought up how we have good chemistry together.\n* He has called me his boyfriend and has joked around about us being in a relationship many times.\n* He has made many references to gay sex to me, and has even flat out said that there was sexual tension between us.\n* He has never shown that much interest in his current girlfriend.\n* He has \"jokingly\" brought up breaking up with her to her face. (Weird, I know)\n* AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, he once asked a small group of friends what would happen if he came out.\n\nThrough the course of these events, I have gone through periods of having feelings for him and not.  As of right now I am not entirely sure how I feel.  I don't know if these are signals that are painfully obvious, but I have always been bad at picking up cues.  I came out under more interesting circumstances and I never really had a girlfriend while I was in the closet, so anything having to do with relationships and dating are completely new and foreign to me.  \n\nI also am not sure what to do if he does have feelings for me, because I am good friends with his girlfriend, and it would be a massive surprise to everyone if he turned out to be gay for me.   I have not brought this up to any mutual friends because of how completely random and out of left field this whole situation is.  I don't want to be a homewrecker, but I also know that I will probably have feelings for him in the future and would like to act on these feelings if they are reciprocated.\nTL;DR:"}

We have and still do have a great relationship. The only disagreements we've had have been about one particular male friend of mine (but he's fine with my other male friends). We lost our virginities to each other, and I was even his first kiss. We love each other so much and are both very devoted. However, throughout this last year, I haven't been doing so well mentally. While I am an introverted person, I've been feeling very lonely and isolated. I have just one small group of friends at college, but that one male friend I mentioned earlier is in that group. Because the guy my boyfriend doesn't like is always around when I'm with those friends, I was spending less and less time with them throughout the year.\n\nI'll hand it to my boyfriend, he was trying really hard to not let this guy bug him. Nonetheless, I spent less time with them for the sake of his feelings. My boyfriend has many friends and acquaintances in his major's community. So while he tells me that it's not like he has other people to hang out with, I know he does. \n\nThis might seems silly, because our relationship is so good other than this aspect, but I feel like maybe we're inhibiting each other. As I said before, I was his FIRST kiss. We've ONLY slept with each other. I occasionally have this sinking feeling that I'll finish college with my boyfriend being my only friend I spend any time with and that we'll eventually resent each other for not experiencing more. \n\nLike I said before, I've been struggling with loneliness and depression lately. A few weeks ago I just didn't show up to work (thus abandoning my job) because I couldn't make myself get out of bed. It's getting to the point where I'm even considered counseling at my school's health center. \n\nI just want another voice of opinion. As I said before, the only friend I feel really close to is my boyfriend, so I don't know who else to talk to about this.\nTL;DR:"}

They always mess up my shifts because I work overnight (I literally just proved they owed me  $200 today for working Tuesdays). My old shift is Friday to Saturday, Saturday to Sunday, Sunday to Monday 11pm to 7am. My new shift will be Monday to Tuesday, Tuesday to Wednesday, Wednesday to Thursday 11pm to 7am. While asking me to work an extra Thursday this week they moved me to the new shift as well and gave me both shifts to work. So I am working 8 days consecutively Thursday to Thursday. I went in to get my missing paycheck and confirm this but she said its not overtime because it doesn't start from the beginning of our payroll. Which is Tuesday to Monday. So even though its a consecutive 8 days its 4 in the old week and 4 in the new week.

We are pretty good friends and hang out on a regular basis. She really seems to enjoy being with me and she once told me that she's \"lucky to have genuine people like you in my life.\" There's just one problem: she's dating someone.\n\nI could go on and on about all the cliches about her beauty and good humor, but the most important aspect to me is how I feel when I am with her. Everything just feels right. When she came to me crying at a party and collapsed into my arms, I almost immediately began crying too. Not out of happiness that she was coming to me for comfort, but because I could feel every bit of her pain and I was truly hurting for her. It felt terrible sharing those emotions with her, but I didn't want to let go. I wanted to just hold her and squeeze every last bit of pain from her body. \n\nShe told me about her relationship and how it wasn't working. I gave her the best advice I could. That she had to do what was best for her and made her happy. I didn't say anything about my feelings for her. It didn't seem right to try and use her moment of sadness and confusion for my own purposes. I wanted her to be happy, even if that meant being with someone that I think is wrong for her. Anyway, she thanked me for listening and we hugged again. She stayed with him and I'm still hurting with desire for her.\n\nI have always felt that she might like me, but won't be the one to make a move. Should I tell her how I feel? I don't mean that I want to tell her to leave him and be with me. I just can't stand knowing that I am always too afraid to tell her the truth. I don't want to let her slip away if she might actually want to be with me. I just don't want to ruin a friendship or play the role of a thief. I simply don't know what to do and I'm hoping somebody has the answer.\nTL;DR:"}

But he constantly insults me and make me feel bad about that. I can never bring up anything with him because he'll just start arguing with me. He always says he's sorry but it gets to a point where that's not good enough anymore. Many people have told me to break up with him. My therapist told me that I'm not meant for long term relationships due to my history of abuse and fear of affection. Is that even possible?

We didnt really know each other, but i thought she was adorable so i figured i'd see if we had anything in common.  She ended up txting me later saying she was up for coffee as friends.  We txted here and there up until coffee and she seemed really cool.  Coffee came after we had to reschedule due to what seemed like legitimate excuses to me.  She seemed like she had a good time and i know i did, we talked for 2 hours b4 she said her dad had to pick her up for x reason.  She wasnt noticeably flirty to me (she did twirl her hair a lot and i wasnt flirty either for fear of coming off as creepy on the first date). I did, however mention i thought her the way she does her hair was cute at a relevant time when we were txting. Anyways, throughout the weeks before coffee and the 3 days since coffee she has never been the one to initiate contact other than things to do with scheduling. So i have a few questions regarding my situation.  First, should i back off due to the lack of initiation on her side?  Second, when she tagged on \"as friends\" when she agreed to coffee was that her just making sure she wasnt making a commitment or her implying she wasnt interested in me thalt way?  I have been worried she might be afraid to tell me she's not interested, and i dont want to bother her.\nTL;DR:"}

But it has come to my attention that my degree is going to become sort of worthless and i wanted some advice - I'm in a public university in singapore. \n\nMy complacency in the first year of college (b.eng computer engineering) caused me to fail a few subjects. I worked really hard to clear those and not get kicked out of school - lost a few sems playing catch-up. I have now got my grades up to a A/B average - i shall not bore you with the specifics. However, it will now take me an extra year to complete my 4-year honors degree. This means I will no longer get the Honors listed on my degree - it will just be a pass degree - irregardless of my grade point average. \n\nI have a work attachment and an intensive Final Year Project I need to do as well - so no way i can overclock and finish it in four years, unless i take special semesters and industrial orientation, which is of a lower value than industrial attachment but shorter. And take about 6 heavy subjects together with my final year project. There is a chance that i may screw up these exams and pass them but get really lousy grades :(.\n\nSo my questions are these: \n\n1) Did employers look at your degree or your grade? \n\n2) How did you explain yourselves when they asked you why it took you longer? \n\n3) Did they hire someone who completed on time, but had worse grades than you, over you? \n\n4) Are you guys paid less than those who completed on time? \n\n5) What other skills did you learn while taking the longer route? \n\n6) Did you do a masters after bachelors'?\n\n7) Should i get lower grades, finish the degree faster and graduate with plain honors or should i focus on learning the subject matter, though it will take an extra year? \n\nI thank you for your time and your advice!\nTL;DR:"}

There are some periods of time where they dont even talk and many of her friends dont even realize she has a boyfriend.

He has two overdrafts and two credit cards maxed out, but the money he makes never goes in any way towards paying these off.\nEvery night he drives home drunk from work. I and several of his friends have tried to get him to stop this, but he blows us off and if we press it further he gets angry because he thinks it isn't a big deal when it's happening in the early hours and there are less cars on the road. He has also boasted about falling asleep at the wheel multiple times when driving late on the motorway, telling it as if it were a funny story.\nAside from this, which I'm pretty sure is enough to get somebody's medical license revoked, he can barely take care of himself, and I would be seriously concerned if I were ever to have someone like him as a doctor. He drinks almost every night, and often spends the next day sleeping off his hangovers instead of going to class, only attending when he knows for certain that a missing attendance will be recorded. He has expressed that as long as he manages to scrape passes in everything he thinks he is fine, but doesn't seem to understand that a medical degree is geared towards a career where cramming before exams and promptly forgetting everything afterwards just isn't an option.\n\nFor two years now people have been trying to get him to take things more seriously and brush up his act, but it's getting to the point where I'm seriously concerned that he might be put in charge of patients whilst working placement in hospital, and even more so that he might someday become a doctor.\n\nTalking it through with him gets me nowhere, how can I draw all this to the university's attention and either put a stop to his behaviour, or bring an end to his degree?

What I feel is more of a need. \n\nAs the last male in my line, it has taken me up until this point to feel this need to ensure that the line of my people continues. What's more, I feel a particular need to have a bunch of offspring. \n\nAccepting that this is the case with me now was easy enough.  But the bigger question is this: how do I figure out if a particular woman would be a good partner and a good mother? \n\nTruth be told, I haven't dated in the last few years. I finally had enough a few years ago of the type of women I was dating and decided to just focus on other things. Looking back, that might have actually been the beginning manifestation of this: wanting to move beyond casual dating relationships and onto a very serious and permanent one for the purpose of having children. I didnt realize it at the time. \n\nAnyhow, not knowing that type of woman - specifically, women who also wanted to have children and who weren't looking to just date - was a serious hurdle. In fact, it remains a serous hurdle. But as I'm not longer moving around all the time and have a far more stable life, I feel that may change.\nTL;DR:"}

My brother's friend had a [dingy] with a motor that we were using to get to the reefs. We we're going about our regular business spearing the shit out of fishes when we see some waves breaking nearby. They were probably just about 3 foot waves and being the idiots that we were, we decided to try and surf them just for shits and laughs... using our boat... So we head up towards them and try to catch a wave. We caught one and we actually got some 3-5 seconds of actual boat surfing out of this fucking experience when the wave turned the boat to its side and flipped it over and fucking sent us and all our gear flying. My brother's friend almost got his face cut off by the motor, luckily it got flooded and died a few seconds from his face. Then the fucking 3 foot waves looked like they doubled in size and kept hitting us hard. We were just panicking and trying to tip the boat over which turned out impossible. We ended up holding on to the boat for our dear lives until we drifted out of the waves and some people on a boat saw our ravaged dingy and towed us all the way back to shore. We ended up ruining a thousand dollar boat motor and lost all our spearfishing gear... for some shits and giggles.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by mowing the grass in front of two beehives\nPOST: So my dad told me that I needed to mow the grass today and that I would need to weed whack the area that sits behind our two beehives.  I didn't think it would be a big deal, so I put on some jeans and tucked in a white tee-shirt and put on a beekeeper's gloves and veil.  So I walked down to the hives and started weed whacking.  I then became annoyed knowing how long it would take and figured I could do the same faster with a big lawn mower.  So I pulled out our big red lawn mower (I didn't know this but bees are aggressive towards the color red) and went down the steep hill to cut the grass in the same outfit I was in before.  I figured if I stayed far enough away from them I would be fine.  Well that was not the case.  So I started my first pass across the hill near our bees, and all of a sudden I felt a sharp pain in my back; I knew I was screwed.  Immediately I flipped out and panicked when I started getting stung by more than one bee. I hurriedly turned off the lawnmower and hauled up my hill to run back inside.  I threw my shirt and gloves off and caught my breath.  I then peered out the window to look toward the bees and then I saw my big red lawnmower slowly rolling down our hill: my heart sank. So I broke the world record putting on a full bee suit and ran all the way down the hill to look for my gloves, ran all the way back up, found the gloves inside, and then went down the stairs on my back porch, slipped and fell, and smashed my back on the stairs.  I was exhausted, but I ran down the hill and stopped the mower just before it was going to fall down into ditch.  I probably looked mentally insane running around my yard in a full bee suit.  Anyways I ended up saving the mower and skipped cutting grass.   Moral of the story, wear a full bee suit when cutting your grass with something loud and red. Honeybees are normally friendly creatures.\nTL;DR:"}

However, I am 17 and am mistaken for maybe 13/14 years constantly.  I have a relatively high IQ and maturity is not the issue.  I have always been the short, prepubescent-looking kid.  It's really about appearance more than personality.  People honestly do not give me a chance, professionally and socially.  I try to dress my age, even a little older.  I feel that the lack of muscle mass is a contributing factor.  I'm currently 5' 6\" and 133 (a little chubby I guess?).  I just got a gym membership and want to know where to start so that I can fill out a decent amount by senior year or even mid summer if possible.

We get along amazing. I'll be the first one to admit to instagram stalk her. I check the pictures she likes. I'll be 100% honest and you'll have to trust me on this one - I do it not because I distrust her, but mainly because I want to see what she finds interesting and for ideas for dates/gifts. And considering I follow few people on ig, the 'liked stream' of my the people I follow is a part of the fun, in a way. But I digress - she generally likes pictures of birds (she loves birds), her coworker's friends, and Peter's photos.\n\nPeter is a guy with 700 followers and follows 900. They follow eachother since around December I believe, but I could be wrong. My girlfriend generally does not like any of her 'closer' guy friends' pictures. She's rather selective with her liking. Yet she has liked about 6 of his last 30 photos on instagram. She has never spoken to me about him, even if she usually tells me about people who she likes and are part of her life. Bottom line is that this behaviour is not typical for her from what I've seen.\n\nI checked on facebook, it seems like they are not friends on Facebook and have no friends in common.\n\nCoupled with the fact that admitted cheating on one of her ex (trickle truthed, I'd imagine she cheated on more than one of her exes), and on one other occasion being excited to see her ex at a party we went to, her fucky behaviour is making me anxious.\n\nI think it's well established that I'm kind of crazy, no need to remind me of that. My question is whether I am justifiably anxious and put off by her liking so many of this guy's selfies. And also, how do I bring my discomfort, or should I bring it up at all?\nTL;DR:"}

Furthermore, I paid; it was the first thing I did after going through the turnstile.\n\nLater I go home and scan my ticket right next to the proof of payment, and mail it back to them in their envelope.  Case closed, I thought.\n\nFast-forward to today -- I get a notice, without explanation, stating that the material I submitted was insufficient for them to withdraw the citation, and that it would still stand.  I am welcome, however, to have an appeal hearing, AFTER paying the fine.  And, after cashing my check, IF they decide to grant me the hearing, they may or may not decide to refund the money they extorted.\n\nFor a bogus $40 ticket, \"lawyer-up\" seems a little excessive, but what should I do?  I do NOT want to pay this shit.  I already paid the parking fee.  I'm not paying both.\nTL;DR:"}

He's in a different department, but we were in the same class last semester and he really just gave me the butterflies from day one. Extremely intelligent, funny, cute, but also seems genuinely kind and down-to-earth.

I rarely spoke around him, and when I did talk something exceptionally stupid or weird came tumbling out of my mouth. I'm sure I made an awful impression on him.\n\nThis has all left me rather frustrated, as I'm really not the wilting flower type.

She didn't speak much English, but in my dream, the language barrier only strengthened our mutual attraction. She went back home, but we wrote to each other often (she could now write in English because dreams are weird), and I planned a visit to Copenhagen. Eventually, I found myself in Denmark, holding this beautiful woman who looked at me with nothing but love in her eyes. I felt true love, and then I woke up.

Details have been changed, as both other parties are redditors. I'm a uni student. I (20m) have a history of depression and confidence issues, which has led to me having very little sexual experience and zero romantic experience (I've never even been on a date). During the summer, I was talking with a friend (lets call her D) who I've become rather attracted to, and in an enormous leap of faith, I asked her out. I've never asked anybody out in my entire life, and I was elated when she yes. We resolved to work out details when school resumes. We continued talking off and on, exchanging what I percieced as somewhat flirty messages. \n\nI should now mention that D (21F) is a bdsm practicioner, as is G, her ex. G (21 M) is our mutual friend. I've never tried it, but I'm curious. She messages me a month after the initial agreement, asking if I'd be play partner to both of them. I agree, thinking that G's presence would be in a mentoring capacity.\n\nLater on, I hear from G that they're going to get back together, leaving me unsure of where I stand. I realize me and D's prior agreement has been negated without my knowledge, which I feel hurt about, and I'm not sure if it was done intentionally or not. I know if I'm making a good move by entering in this 3-way partnership. I'm now second-guessing everything about this situation, and I don't want to damage it. I'm not sure if I'm settling just for a chance at D, or even what sexual dynamic will be at play here. I'm just very lost.\nTL;DR:"}

Twice over the last two weeks, she's stayed out until 4am or so, doing cocaine with a guy in her class who she met there. She's been hanging out with another guy, too, who has a house by the beach. They play music together.\n\nShe's typically had a lot of guy friends  in the past. This doesn't bother me. In fact, I love this about her. All my friends enjoy her company. Also, I know she typically handles herself well while intoxicated. \n\nLast night was her birthday. She was going out and told me that she was going to call me when she got back to her place. She called me at 4am. She told me she was locked out of her place. Then she said that she tried to call me from someone else's phone earlier that night while she was out. She typically doesn't carry her phone while out, because it's risky to carry around a nice phone where she is. How could she have called me at four if locked out? \n\nI've already asked if these guys try to hit on her, and she says they haven't. I know the guy from her class is cheating on a girlfriend he has back home, unless they're in an open relationship that I don't know about. \n\nI love this girl more than anyone else I've ever met.

At this point, I was starting to give merit to what my friends had been trying to tell me.\n\nThe last 2 days is when this gets really interesting. Somehow one of our normal conversations led to her saying doing things such as asking me to shave my pubes, asking my favorite kind of porn, whether I'm circumcised, etc. That's not all, but that's what stuck out to me. How else is a guy to interpret that other than some kind of interest?\n\nLast night I finally made my move. She told me that she wished school would get cancelled. I responded by saying there are so many things better to do with a day, and she asked me what I meant. I took the opportunity to say \"a cliche dinner and movie date\". Cue being ignored until this morning.\n\nToday, everything was totally normal between us. She smiled at me whenever we passed, we texted all day. She even sent me a picture of her ass captioned \"you know you want it\". At this point I'm pretty well confused. I drove her home after school and we had our usual banter. Everything was normal.\n\nToday I made just about the most blatant move I could by saying, \"How would you like to go on a date sometime soon?\" No answer.\n\nI guess what I want to know is what is going on here. Am I ignoring something important?\nTL;DR:"}

I haven't ordered a pizza online in a while, so i go to the Dominos website. While one of my high friends tries to \"make her own pizza\" she takes the cheese off one side, and the website pops up going \"Whoa there!\" ect. That makes us laugh. So I want to reciprocate. \n\nLong story short, we are watching the pizza being made on the pizza tracker. It says Jeff is baking your pizza. I think it is funny it tries to get so personal, that it tells you who is making your pizza. \n\nSo down in the \"Advice,Feedback,Grumblings\" spot while Jeff is working diligently, I write \"I am WATCHING you, Jeff.\"\n\nA few minutes later i receive a txt that says, \"No, I am watching, YOU.\"\n\nI wait a few and respond with, \"You win this time, Jeff...\"\n\n*No response* \n\nNext day i think i will be clever and ask a friend that works at a different Dominos, if he knows a Jeff. He says he does and sends me his *supposed* last name.\n\nObviously you can see where this is going. My friend was slow and told me the last name of a Jeff that works at his Dominos, even after i told him which store to look for. Here is my conversation with Jeff before i figured out my friend didn't get the whole picture, and sent me the wrong last name. \n\nMe: Your move, Jeff (insert wrong last name)\nJeff: Wrong last name, try again (Insert my full name) \nMe: Well played\nJeff: Until next time\nTL;DR:"}

Her best friend told me Friday night that I should, so I figured that was a good sign. \n \nSo finally last night I gathered my courage and asked her to homecoming.  I guess she was busy doing something at the time or something, because when I asked she didn't respond, she just held her finger up to me like \"hold on a second.\"  So I waited for a while, she left the room and reentered so I figured she would come answer.\n\nWell instead she talked to some of her friends, kind of glancing at me every now and then, and then walked out of the room without approaching me.\n\nSo I have no idea what to make of this.\nTL;DR:"}

The posted limit was 70 and I was going 80, which I'm told by others is still a legal speed in America as you are allowed to be a maximum of 10mph over the limit for it to be considered a state violation. \n\nThe officer claimed I was going 88 and was very adamant about showing his radar, but radar can easily be fixed. Not to mention, every other car was flying past me, but they chose me for some reason.\n\nAnyway, back on topic, I was in a car I am leasing and still have to pay off. If I refuse to pay this ticket, will the ticket impact the return of the car to the car dealership I am leasing it from?\n\nIn 2010, I was pulled over in Georgia, my very first ticket(the one I'm writing about being my second), and it was a several thousand dollar fine. I never paid it. I honestly thought that if I got pulled over again in Georgia I'd be arrested for not paying my first ticket, but it just sort of... vanished. Nothing ever became of it. I had the violation on a different car that at the time I owned, but I trashed it soon after when someone crashed into it while it was parked outside my home in New York. That ticket doesn't seem to be in Georgia's system, nor New York's, so it's just gone... \n\nNow, I don't want to pay or go to court. I'm not doing either. Although, if it affects the car I am currently leasing somehow, I'll just pay it. I just need to know if it affects the lease. If it doesn't, it won't get paid and I will throw it out like the last one.\nTL;DR:"}

He hung out with me and my friends one night but I soon found out he had a girlfriend (they're broken up now). That was fine. We hung out as friends a few times more until I had to go home for the summer (this was in college and I live out of state). I spent the last year overseas and now I'm back in my college town. I ran into him again and we hung out two days in a row.\n\nLast night we went to a bar and ended the night with a kiss and him coming back to my dorm, but just to sleep. In the morning we did some more physical stuff, but I stopped him when he tried to initiate actual sex, and he was okay with it.\n\nAnyway, now I'm very confused. In my experience people I like either don't like me or just want to hook up. I'm afraid he's only into my body because he's not very talkative and we always drink when we're together. We don't know too much about each other really and when I ask him about things it never becomes a real conversation. I feel I don't know where this is going, but he knows I'm not into hooking up, so I don't know what's happening. Plus, he's moving in a few months. He's so nice and sweet, but it could just be a front to get laid. That being said, I don't know if I'm looking to date either because I've never done that and have no idea how that works lol.\nTL;DR:"}

He sent an email to a few of her friends asking for their help to get her to stop, but I don't know what's become of that, (from my experience she's very manipulative). He's also tried talking to her. We decided a while ago that the best way to go is to just ignore her. It hasn't been working.

I asked her out on a date around 4 weeks ago, and she politely declined, and thankfully it hasn't been awkward at all and in a weird way it may have even brought us closer together. She said she \"did not want to date at the moment\" which I believe is true because at the time she was about 4 months out of a 2 year relationship that ended sourly (she was cheated on basically). An even bigger factor than that though is that she was going to go to university this September, but didn't get the grades required which is why she's now staying put. \n\nSo the last couple times I've seen her since asking her out I've been nothing but normal, I'll admit I was bit bummed out about being turned down, (I really like her) but I haven't been creepy or persistent about it. When we've been together (in group settings) generally her attention has been toward me, and I've done subtle 'tests' like leaning my leg against hers to see if she's comfortable with the contact (she doesn't pull away). We laugh a lot too, and now I'm stuck wondering whether i should ask her out again, wait longer before asking, or just move on. Any and all advice appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

As you could probably guess, my first dose is in the morning and I try my best not to forget to take it because of nausea since my panic/anxiety attacks are quite prevalent in the morning hours. I also take 10 mg propranolol episodically for tremors, which might be contributing to my dizziness since I miss breakfast so often. Just about everyday I skip breakfast because almost immediately upon waking up I am bombarded with nausea. It usually subsides around 3pm regardless of whether or not I ate lunch. \n\nThese symptoms are really starting to mess with my college curriculum. Missing Gen. Ed. classes is one thing, but missing valuable shop time because I always feel the need to vomit and nothing comes up is a whole another deal.\nTL;DR:"}

Has anyone else delt with this before?\nPOST: My ex and I were together for a total of 7 months. On New Year's Eve this year she broke up with me because we are in different places in our lives. (She is significantly older than me and doesn't want to wait for me to finish my masters before settling down.) She said some really hurtful things and I don't think getting back together is what's good for me.\n\nI work as a barista at a local coffee shop and since 2 weeks after the break up she has been coming in at least once a week. Yes, she was a regular before, but she only comes in on days I work now despite schedule changes. \n\nIt upset me a lot the first time, and now it's just frustrating. It is mostly frustrating because I have been trying to get some of my things back, but she is always too busy or too sick to do it. Even after I text her and she's too sick I'll see her in the shop the next day.\n\nMy question is am I just being too sensitive about this? I have only ever been in long distance relationships and this is the first time I have dated someone from my area. Yes, seeing her was inevitable, but I haven't gone into her work at all out of respect. Has anyone else had an ex that has done this and how do you deal with it?\nTL;DR:"}

We were \"seeing\" each other, but not quite \"dating\".  About the middle of the summer, I decided to commit, but by then she wasn't into it.  After a couple of months we came back together, and realize that we are perfect for each other, though in the time we were apart she had made plans to move to California indefinitely.  Not for a career or anything, just for a change of weather (we live in the wintery parts of the midwest) and check out something new for a while.  \n\nI support her entirely.  Being just a little bit older, I've done what she's doing.  I get it, that point in life where you need to get out on an adventure of your own, and I would hate to pressure her to stay and later have her resent me for not going.  \n\nWe've since talked some about more clearly defining how long \"indefinite\" is, but she's set on at least a year.  \n\nShe has graduated college (BS apparel/textiles/minor in art), I have three semesters left (BA sculpture/AA business).  I also have a son from a previous relationship that lives in my town and I would be loath to move away from.\n\nI'm not asking if it's worth it, she is absolutely worth it.  I just don't know how best to handle this for the highest probability of success, and maybe some success stories.  Has anyone experienced a long distance relationship?

There should be no issue with her going home to her own house when he is not here. \n\nWhen I talked to him about it, he acted like it shouldn't be a big deal because my girlfriend stays over on some weekends. But the difference is, I am at her house just as much (or more) as she is here. And my girlfriend lives over an hour away. It's not like she can just drive back and forth evey day.

I found out that back in September, another university's choir visited ours and she met a guy and they had a long distancey sort of fling. When we started dating in February I knew about this guy and that she visited him but didn't care a ton. We all have a past, right?\n\nSo it took us a really long time to have sex. About 4 months. I was definitely frustrated but I enjoyed being with her so I didn't let it get to me too much. In my opinion and based on past experience that is a very long time to wait, and I was very insecure about the whole thing because I thought she must not be attracted to me if she has to wait this long. But we had many talks, she assured me that she takes it slow and eventually in June we had sex for the first time. We've consistently had sex since. I thought she was worth the wait.\n\nI then found out that she slept with the aforementioned other guy. Two months after meeting each other. At a school very far away (she flew up there) and it was only the SECOND time they had EVER seen each other. I was shocked. I thought she was just not that type and it really surprised me. She also lied about it one time, as in she told me that they didn't do anything. Honestly it crushes me that she slept with him while I worked so hard on our relationship for her to sleep with me. \n\nLike sex isn't everything but it is very important to me. She assured me that she waited so long with me because she thought we had a future which I think we do. She claimed that the other guy was important to her and that she cared about him. I'm painfully jealous and am wondering if I should just get over it since we've been together for so long.\n\nThanks\nTL;DR:"}

We developed feelings for each other, and about six months ago, we start dating and eventually become a couple.\n\nEvery so often, lately, we'd have petty arguments over really small things.

It's something I'm ashamed of, and she's been kind enough to take it for a while, but the other night, she decided enough was enough.\n\nShe said that we should break up, but with a bit of soul searching, she came over and said that she really wanted a break like she originally intended.

She said she wanted space so she could get her thoughts together and also so she could concentrate on her final year work.\n\nIt really chips away at you when you're forced to look at someone you still love from a distance, and I ended up calling her asking for some explanation of where we stood.

I ended up hitting it off with one of them [24F], with the friends saying to go for it. Ended up making out at a party, then went on a real date like a week later as time permitted.

So pretty active two weeks with communication and hanging out in a more romantic sense then previously.\n\nAfter that I didn't see her all week, and only texted minimally because we're both in school and working. I attempted both Friday and Saturday to invite her to go out with friends, with Sat. offering an option to just hang out together instead as well.

Went did my own thing that weekend, interacting other girls and friends, and tried to put her out of my mind until she initiated. Suffering from chronic cases of one-itus, this is actually uncharacteristic of me. Another week goes by, I hear from her once in a brief conversation, but no attempts to actually talk or hang out on her behalf beyond that. \n\nThen yesterday I get a \"are you avoiding me? I know I can be hard to read sometimes\" type text. We talked and will be hanging out this week which cleared the air a bit, but I've got this metaphoric sour taste in my mouth about it.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: After dating my BF [22M] for over 2 years, he still doesn't know if he loves me [20F]\nPOST: I'll try to keep this short and to the point, if I leave out anything important, feel free to ask down below. Sorry if I dont make any sense, I just finished crying. \n\nAfter a year of dating my BF, I said \"I love you\". He expresses how it made him happy to hear that yet he can't say the same. He didn't really give a reason then, just that he can't. We had a long talk, with him explaining that I shouldn't hold myself back if I want to say it just that he can't. I was hurt yes, but I accepted it. \n\nFast forward to today, I mentioned how now it has been over 2 years we have dated. I asked him if he had a reason why he can't say, \" I love you\" to me. Ever since that first time, I haven't told him I love him except when I'm drunk. He replied with, \"honestly i dont have an answer myself\".  From that I told him it is most likely he doesn't love me back, simple as that. Yet he insisted he doesn't know, he has thought about why but doesn't have an answer he is certain of. He says he feels it may be because of some uncertainties he has (i dont know what those are).We ended this conversation by me saying, I'll wait for that answer and I'd appreciate one. But we both agreeded maybe time will tell.\n\nBefore I brought this up to him a second time, I was convinced he loved me back. Nothing seemed to prove other wise. I thought that maybe he just expresses his love through different ways rather than words. No big problems, we had the trust, communication, and commitment. Now after hearing his answer I feel my heart being ripped into a million pieces, dramatic I know. This weekend I'm going on a trip with him and his family. I feel lost and confused. I want to this relationship to work but I dont know how long I can wait for him to love me.\n\nI guess I'm wondering of anyone has been through a similar situation? What their actions were? Or any opinions anyone may have. Thank you.\nTL;DR:"}

Because of all social events (partying, etc) which comes with the student life + the risk of bumping in to her, getting over her is harder than it needs to be. \n\nAt first I thought I would be fine, but I've come to realize that seeing your ex only makes the process of getting over her harder.

Sometimes I feel that I can do it, other times I panic because I feel like I can't take this anymore and just want to give up. \n\nAnyway, every day is hard enough, and seeing her makes it worse.

We've known each other for over a month, been on about 3 official dates, and seen each other casually a bit more than that and we're both clear that we'd like to take it further with the view of a serious relationship. But, I don't get the feeling that her feelings for me are strong enough to last 3 weeks, considering it's early days and as a pretty girl she has a number of guys hanging around and I don't know whether her feelings for me are strong enough to wait (she says i'm the only guy she's seeing and I believe her but don't know if it's only because other guys haven't made a move yet or something. I know of other guys she's interested in that are texting her that she could easily potentially jump over to, plus her ex boyfriend is circling, who she admits she still has feelings for). \n\nI really like her (unfortunately i've fallen for her, despite people telling me not to get too invested so early on). I'm worried that without physical contact, and with the potential for other guys to fill my place in her day-to-day life if she comes into contact with them, as perhaps their schedules match up or whatever, i'll lose her. I've had this happen before, so I kind of anticipate this happening now since this seems to be how it goes. I said to her casually to 'stick around' and not go anywhere, meaning and implying that I hope we can continue when she's available next. She said 'can't promise I won't' but am not sure if she's joking...but I would have liked a committed answer as it kind of seems to me like she was only half joking and shows she's not entirely keen on me to promise she won't go off with someone else. \n\nSo how do I keep this going if we can't meet?\nTL;DR:"}

Last year, we adopted two kids who are now 1 and 1.5 years old.  From the day we had SSNs for them, we opened up savings accounts where we have deposited any cash gifts to them, as well as $25 each per paycheck ($50/mo each- for now) auto deposited from our account.\n\nWe have looked at some of the college savings plans, but if the kids decide not to go to college, we aren't happy with the other limited options for the money.  I went to college, and while education is important to me, I not everyone is cut out for college.  My wife went from high school directly into the military and would be proud if one or both of our kids would follow that path.  The military option wouldn't necesarily require any loans for higher education (which is usually the only option in the college savings plans).\n\nOur goal is to have a pretty good little 'nest egg' for each kid when they turn 18 which they can use for college or any other productive, responsible thing they may need when they become adults.  We are really looking for a good long-term savings solution with low risk and high returns.  CD's seem like our only option, but their returns are pretty low.

She is foreign and comes from a lot of money-- she has bought him gifts without him telling his actual gf where they have come from. \n\nMy roommate has A LOT of loans and has historically made a lot of decisions that have been spiteful toward me, irresponsible, and cost me a lot of money.

His actual girlfriend is aware of this fact and supports it since he is in so much debt. It's really an unhealthy situation for me, but whether I want to condemn him to prison is a whole different story (I really don't). On the other hand, what are the legal obligations of my position? Now that I know... I feel that if I get questioned by somebody investigating the marriage, I don't have any deniability since he has told me. \n\nMy roommate is known  for lying, so at first I thought it might be one of those situations where he exaggerates things. Additionally, it's a good excuse for him to continue contact with this other girl without his girlfriend's permission. However, his girlfriend told me the other day he was out getting \"engagement photos.\" \n\nI know, I know I should keep my mouth shut... but honestly after him ruining a lot of things with his irresponsibility, I don't know what to do.

E and I decided to not officially date over the summer, due to a variety of reasons including being single for a while, as we both recently got out of long relationships. But we talk every day, and two weeks in (about a month ago) I booked a plane ticket to go visit her for a week.\n\nMy problem - and please tell me if I'm being a complete idiot - is that while I'm back home a coworker and I have been getting closer. I'll probably know this girl (let's call her A) for a total of two months and then I'll never see her again. \n\nI'm torn about hooking up with A. I really care about E, but we were clear about NOT being a couple this summer. I think that if something happened with A I wouldn't tell her. A also knows this would be just a summer thing - probably even just a one time thing. \n\nAnyways, I have a dinner with A tomorrow and I'm leaving to see E in exactly one week. If I do this, does that make me a piece of shit? I know I would feel at least a little bit guilty. I have no way of knowing if E is doing the same back where she is, though.

I only know the details from what she told me since I never really asked nor do I want to know exactly about those people, but it seems like it was just this one guy, and another guy in November whom she only kissed and such but didn't sleep with. She claims that when she realized I would be willing to have casual sex with her when we meet, she didn't want to sleep with anyone else, and she didn't. \n\nEven if she did, I have no reason to feel jealous. She wanted me for a long time and didn't have to stay abstinent but she did anyways.

I pay rent monthly, and all the utilities (gas, power, water, cable) as well as my cell phone.\n\nI have a checking and savings account with a bank.

To this day I **only** have this card. So at this time I've had the card for over one year. I pay the card off each month, so I constantly have a $0.00 balance on the card. I usually only use it for some gas / groceries. So it's not often the amount on the card exceeds $100 at any given time (emergencies are another case).\n\nEven while paying of the card and being current on other bills, my credit score has been the same for the past five to six months or so (according to TransUnion). I currently have 1 credit card and I'm using the card wisely to try and build credit.\n\nI've never been late on a payment, and the information available to TransUnion seems to show that as well. So it wasn't like delinquent behavior is holding me down.\n\nMy goal was to have a good enough credit score to get a loan by the end of the year for a new set of wheels. Sadly, I don't have anyone who can cosign for me...so I'm kind of SOL there. But I feel like I'm not going to hit my goal now that I am unable to make my credit score budge.

It seems like a game-changer that's just making dating harder.\n\nI grew up being taught from my parents, adult siblings, and movies, that dating is something that happens about once a week, maybe twice a month. The first date would consist of an intimate dinner, which the man would pay for.\n\nNowadays, my friends are all telling me that you just \"text\" the woman whenever you want, and ask her to \"hang out\", as if you were just interested in being platonic friends.\n\nThis doesn't sit right with me.\n\nThe whole point of asking a woman to dinner, is to convey your interest in a relationship without directly saying it. I don't ask my friends out to dinner, unless it's an occasion.\n\nAnd why are these women always saying they \"would have paid for themselves\" like it was some sort of problem that I did it for them? Is the \"texting and hanging out\" thing so expected that what I'm doing is coming across as \"just being friendly\"?\n\nAnd I've heard a thing or two about \"hanging out\". From what I've heard, it's pretty much code for sex. I've heard that in this crude version of dating, the guy pretty much immediately goes in for sex without getting to really know or understand the girl on any respectable level.\n\nFrom what I've experienced with texting, it seems like a shitty, inferior mode of communication. Messages are usually extremely ambiguous, and people will always assume the most negative meaning that your message could possibly have, and the inescapable intrusiveness of texts seems so clingy. And we're supposed to carry full conversations with this? This all seems horribly detrimental to the progress of a relationship.\n\nYet these are the expectations that our generation is consecrating. I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy when it comes to this sort of thing, and I'm not going to follow a norm that will become just another forgotten error in the ongoing trial-and-error we call life.\nTL;DR:"}

I have dated the same girl since high school. When we started she was in grade 9 and I was in grade 11. We were very young and didn't really know what we were getting into but we were always happy. Fast forward 6 years. Still no major problems. No major fights, no cheating, no really big issues that were worth breaking up over in my opinion. Before Christmas she expressed her concern that we have been together a really long time and it was scary that we hadn't known anything that wasn't each other. She mentioned taking a break but we decided against it. About 5 weeks ago she asked me to hangout and broke up with me. She said she was really confused and was unsure if she was still in love with me. At first I wasn't even very upset with the decision. I too had a little doubt in us. Not necessarily in our relationship but just in the fact that we dated for so long. It's not really something you are suppose to do in today's society. \n\nDuring the 5 weeks I realized very quickly that my doubts were incredibly stupid and that I love her. The first couple weeks we would talk every couple days. The fourth week we talked every single day about our relationship. I explained that we could work at making it exciting again together and she seemed interested in doing so but didn't want to get back together just to break up again. She wants to be sure about us before getting back together so it is fair for both of us and so she isn't changing her mind all the time. I respect that but I also wish we were together.\n\nMany of my female friends gave me advice to avoid contact which will make her miss me more I guess. We have not spoke in a week now. My first question is when does this no contact end? Does she have to approach me first? Also does anyone have any comments or suggestions on the break up and ways I can get this going again.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm considering it, on the condition that I am the center of attention, but don't know where to look for inspiration.\nPOST: Background: Long-term relationship (almost 4 years). We're comfortable experimenting sexually, and my BF (28m) recently posed the idea of a threesome to me (28f). I'm not against it. But my ground-rule is that I want to be the center of attention. I'm not signing up to watch my BF pile drive another girl while I rub their backs. What turns me on is the idea of both my BF and another girl doing stuff to me. I think for this first time (if it happens) I'd like to minimize the amount of time another girl spends touching my boyfriend, and maximize the amount of time she spends on me. After that we'll see. But I'm not yet 100% sure I'm into this, and am still totally unclear as to how the technicalities of a m+f+f threesome will play out.\n\nIdea: Since my BF and I sometimes watch porn together, I thought we should watch some threesome vids to get inspired before we take the leap.\n\nProblem: all the threesome videos we can find seem to involve two girls slobbering all over one guy, who is invariably the center of attention. Do videos even exist in which a girl and a guy are focusing their attention on one lucky girl? Or at least something close enough to pique my imagination? Or maybe not and I'm going about this all wrong?\n\nReddit, help! Your ideas and suggestions for this slightly nerve-wracking endeavor would be much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

The three of us (plus one of Michelle's lady friends) went out for dinner. We talked, laughed, I controlled much of the conversation without seeming too overbearing/dominant. Stacy and I connected (arm-touching, lots of smiles, genuinely interested in convo). But I didn't have any one-on-one time with Stacy, so I got her number from Michelle two days later. I told Michelle that Stacy seemed quiet. \"She's usually not like that, she's more talkative. But she said you're sweet and cute!\" So we texted a few times that day, then I called her that week to ask her out. She was going away for the weekend so we set something up for that Wednesday.\n\nOn Wed, she texted to say she still wasn't feeling well (she had to lay in bed all weekend while her family skied ), canceled dinner, and rescheduled to get coffee the next day. She seemed fine, coffee was great, excellent conversation, went back to her place to meet her dog. I asked if she was doing anything for V-Day, but she already had plans with Michelle. So we hugged goodbye and I left for a prior engagement (sports-related). That was last week.\n\nI saw her in a coffee shop on Sunday and talked for a few minutes. I decided to call her on Monday to ask her out on a *real* date, no answer. I called again on Tuesday, no answer, so I left a message. I haven't heard back since. \n\nHere's the thing. She seems interested when we talk/text, but she never answers her phone when I call to make plans. Am I too late--did I miss my opportunity? Or should I ease up and let things progress slowly? Or push forward and be more insistent (in a gentlemanly way, of course) on going out? Should I just directly ask her whether or not she's interested?\nTL;DR:"}

One of the problems I have with my BF (we are a m/f couple, both 22, 3.5 yrs) is that when we get into an argument and I tell him that I didn't appreciate some of his words or actions, he tends to say \"well I did it in response to you.\" Or, he will say \"but remember, why did we start talking like this? Who started being stressed first?\" \n\nThis happens in almost every argument and I am sick and tired of it. I have tried having a serious talk with the bf but it goes nowhere. Yes, there are times when I am the one that starts an argument or becomes stressed, but it leads quickly to a snowballing, nasty argument. For example, the other day I told him I was not comfortable with him going out with a group of friends with girls that I did not know. He said I was overreacting, the argument snowballed, and pretty soon the insults were flying. I told him that there were things that he did that I didn't appreciate and he said \"but remember why did I get like that? It was all because of you!\" He likes to call it finding the \"source of the problem\" and that he is \"not doing it to hurt me\". He says he doesn't want the arguments either. \n\nreddit, I am at my wits end. Can you tell me why he might be saying this stuff? It confuses me to the point where I am not sure if I am the one doing wrong or if he doesn't take responsibility for his own actions. It makes me cry my eyes out because I want to be with him, but so far things are going horribly. I can't sleep because this issue makes me think that we just can't make it work. I need him to not blame me anymore. Even if I do something wrong, is there a way he could just not say it like this?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been a boy for a while now and I want to become a man. I'm twenty years old and I've noticed a lot of my feelings haven't matured. I grew up in what I'd like to surmise as an unstable situation. As a result I've grown to be unstable myself. I make impulsive decisions on just about every aspect of my life and most certainly end up regretting the place I've put myself in as a result of these choices (not the decision, just where I end up). I'm insecure and constantly feeling that I need to have a sense of want from someone else. I can't function alone and almost always require attention and approval from those around me. I'm not a dominant person and almost always take the submissive route.\n\nSo what should I do?

He was not peeing in the litter box, his urine was discolored and he was continuously itching which we assumed was fleas. Aside from that he was acting like a normal cat and was already playing with my other cat. I took him into the vet as soon as possible and they diagnosed him with ringworm. Unfortunately it had already been long enough that I am not covered entirely in sores from ringworm and my other cat has 3 sores on his face. I am unusually susceptible but it still sucks. In regards to the urine problem they did a urine analysis and it came back positive for a UTI and unusual amounts of bilirubin. He is now on antibiotics for the UTI but had to go back for bloodwork because the bilirubin levels really concerned the vet. In a cat his age (4 months) he should not have those levels. She phoned the shelter that I had received him from and has been having difficulty getting straight answers from them as to what medication he had been on if any and any other problems he has had. They are paying for his bloodwork and if it comes back positive for ANYTHING they have agreed to pay for my other cats bloodwork in case it is something contagious.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Does it make sense for me to transfer my IRA from Scottrade to Vanguard?\nPOST: Hey there, I tried taking a look at previous postings, but couldn't find a good answer. Here's my situation:\n\nI have two accounts with Scottrade, a brokerage account worth about 60k right now and Rollover IRA worth just north of 10k. This rollover IRA came from when I left a job back in 2003, and I just haven't done much with it. I have a few holdings, but the majority of the account is in unsettled trading funds. \n\nSo, here are my questions:\n\nA. Is a rollover IRA essentially just a traditional IRA?\n\nB. I was looking into the 2045 Targeted Retirement Fund at Vanguard. I'm not good with having to spend a lot of time on this (I know myself) and so I like the idea that I could just put all of my money into that fund and it will manage holdings and reallocate as my needs change on the way to retirement. If I chose, could I just purchase this fund through Scottrade? Would there be differences on the fees, aside from the transaction fee? \n\nC. Whether or not I move the funds to Vanguard or not, I am considering a conversion to a Roth IRA. I know that the tax code changed for this year and I am a bit lost trying to figure how such a change would impact my tax liability for this year. \n\nFor the years 2008-2011 (and part of 2012), I had been claiming zero exemptions on my W4, which resulted in annual tax refunds in the $2000-3000 range. Last year I decided that I wanted more money coming in, so I adjusted my withholding. The result was that in 2011, I saw roughly $6600 in FIT withheld, vs. just $5500 in 2012. I am concerned that this decreased withholding, combined with the tax liability from the Roth conversion, would put me in danger of owing money for this year. \n\nWith that being said, my employment situation may be changing drastically in August, which would most likely result in decreased earning for this year. Should that play into my decision at all?\n\nI appreciate any thoughts you all may have. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

I would appreciate your objective feedback and opinions. \n\nBackground:\n\nI am female who has just returned from a short trip to a large city in Nevada where liquor flows freely and men overtly flirt with women in order to bed them. I will never see the man I slept with again as he lives somewhere far away, I am not emotionally attached to him and I do not want to see him again. When we met my drunken mental Id told me to accept his advances. My ego and super ego filtered the request and gave the okay because open relationships make allowances for these instances. \n\nThe man I am/was in an open relationship with is my ex high school sweetheart. We decided that the open relationship status would be most effective so that we do not tie ourselves down to someone we've already dated and so that we can keep our dating options open. We agreed on the arrangement about 3 months ago after 3 months of casual sex/friends with benefits. (6 months total)\n\nSince the start of our open relationship we slowly, organically began to care for each other more than intended. I've had to mentally stop myself from slipping an \"I love you\" because I thought he didn't reciprocate my feelings. I do care for him very much and I am sorry for my actions. Had I been in an established exclusive relationship, this situation would not have arisen at all. \n\nI told my boyfriend about the situation about it as soon as I was able to make face contact. We have discussed some aspects already but he needs time to himself to think about whether or not he can forgive me.

Very early in the relationship (actually technically we weren't in a relationship yet, but we had agreed to be monogamous) he has sex with another woman. I decided not to leave him. I haven't had issues trusting him since then, mostly because we spent so much time together, and he never did anything suspicious.

He spent the summer in his hometown where one of his ex girlfriends lives and I cannot shake the feeling that they had sex at some point. A couple days ago I saw a text from her on his phone and I asked what she was messaging him about. He told me that she had sent him something funny earlier that day and they started having a casual conversation and catching up. This is really the only evidence I have of any contact between them, and I know it's kind of crazy to assume cheating. \n\nWhat I'm realizing is that I may not have fully regained trust in him.

Imajerk said the specs were bad, because it had an input lag of 8.5ms. Cool, that's fine. I guess I'll look for alternatives. At this point, he offers to sell his TV.\n\nHis TV was a 40\" Toshiba 1080 with better input response, more HDMI ports, for the cost of $300. He told me he originally bought it for $400 and it he will not budge for lower than $300. I waited and thought about it for a week, and I decided I would go with the deal. My thinking was that this didn't seem like too bad of a deal, and my friend wouldn't go through with ripping me off if it was. After talking with another friend, he found comparable TV prices for $150-$250. The $250 was also considered a bad deal.\n\nI understand that I didn't do enough research, and I should have realized this was a bad deal. I'm still learning how to be a consumer and such. My question is if Imajerk did a dick move. We are still good friends, I just want to prove he's a jerk.\nTL;DR:"}

But I really feel this has gotten under my skin in a bad way. \n\nBasically, her college f*ck buddy was a guy in a local band and it turns out that they've booked a fairly major gig in our city (not the originial college town.) They used to hook up and etc throughout most of her college days, but she says that she hasn't kept in touch. He was supposedly really cool, \"super hot\", and all of her friends just loved loved loved him. Yay for him.\n\nI agreed to go to the concert with her tonight (because she is my gf, afterall and we love concerts), but today she says that she anticipates being invited backstage for a party and she's super excited about it. I'm not so super excited about it. In fact, I'm loathing the whole evening now.\n\nShe says that she hasn't talked to him since college and isn't even facebook friends with him. But somehow knows that he got married, divorced and now has a kid. And there was no real answer when I asked where the backstage party invite came from.\n\nUhg. I feel like an ass for being so uptight, but all I really want to do at this point is bail on the whole night and just go get drunk. Obviously that won't help, because then I'll just disbelieve anything that she says happened. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to gt over this. Should I man up and go?

We live together and just being around her makes me want sex. I'm content with once a day, or more if oppertunity allows. I do have an incredibly high sex drive though, and would honestly take as much as I can get. \nHowever, her sex drive is much lower than mine, and she rejects my advances incredibly often, so much to the point now that I feel she is more interested in watching tv than being intimate with me, and that the attraction isn't mutual. \nNow, the main problem with this is,l that I get an incredibly strong internal feeling of sexual frustration when we go a while without sex, so much so that it effects my mood in general. I try to control it, but I just can't. \n\nWe have talked about it multiple times, and is now basically an argument that escalates each time. Each time it comes up, the sex increases for about a week, then goes right back to as it was. \n\nWhat can we do to fix this?

We sat up one night talking after work and really seemed to both have a great time.\n\nObviously she might just be nice and have no interest in dating me and there isn't much I can do about that. But my worry is that she is interested now however eventually starts to see me as a roommate and/or friend she gets along with and not want to go down that path in case it ends badly. \n\nI'm not shy from proposing things and certainly not against the idea of moving out if we did make it work so there wasn't heaps of pressure on us. But I guess I'm worried about telling her how I feel and then making it weird if she isn't interested.\n\nIf we met at a bar or through mutual friends I'd just say, \"hey lets go for a date\", but if I asked her out to dinner now It might get confusing as what it is, a date or two roommates going for dinner? And laying it all out like that beforehand would certainly make it a bit weird. I mean I don't want to say I'm willing to move out before we even go on a date.

He sent me a link to a local news page where the first thing I see is my FIL's face and the charges against him. Its incredibly damning. His dad has had some serious health problems recently and almost passed away a few months back which we learned from my MIL (they divorced a long time ago) and it seems at this point their children were taken away from them and all this was discovered.\n\nHis dads bail was set very high I think, I have never had much reason to look into bail terms but someone has bailed him out. We think that his elder brother convinced his very elderly paternal grandparents to remortgage their house for this purpose. Upon his release from jail his my FIL has started reaching out to my husband, telling him how much he loves and misses him and it is really concerning me. I know he hasn't been convicted but I just feel like I want him to have nothing to do with our future family ever, we are currently trying to get pregnant and this feels terrifying. To make matters worse I actually was sexually abused from the ages of 10-14 and this is right in the age range of the girls he is alledged to have harmed.\n\nI'm not 100% sure of what advice I am looking for but just people to talk to about it would be nice. Obviously I don't want to tell anyone in the real world in case he is aquitted and everything is fine but my husband dislikes talking about it intensely which I understand. He is hurt and confused by it because he still loves his dad even though they don't speak. The drama is insane and I have no frame of reference for it since my family is as vanilla as they come. Our wildest moment was when my Grandad drank too much grappa one christmas and ended up hugging the toilet for so long we all had to pee in the garden. Good times.\nTL;DR:"}

I wasn't angry and I told him we could hang out the next day but he had sort of a freak out about not seeing me and used what I though was some pretty manipulative language to get me to go out.\n\nI ended up telling him he was being way too over the top about the situation and I didn't feel like continuing the conversation. This eventually led to him saying he had to \"get back on his feet\" before he could be friends with me again....so ok I don't really want to be around someone who acts like that anyway.\n\nCut to a few days ago he sends me a much more coherent message but still with the same idea, that he's stressed out from his life things, that he cares about me but he had to get back on his feet and once he does he wants to try to be friends again and that he'll contact me down the road.\n\nShould I even bother responding? I feel bad his life is going the way it is but I feel like saying something like 'good luck' is patronizing. I'm honestly not even sure I want to get back into a friendship with him again.

Either way, it's a refreshing change from all the negativity that has been in my head my entire life.  Maybe I'm not the troll I thought I was?  Maybe I've just been blind my entire life and all the self hate has prevented me from potential relationships with women?  \n\nHonestly I just got sick of living in doubt and just went for it.

I had my laptop with him, so he gave me his wifi password and I torrented the three seasons for him. \n\nIn the morning, he gave me his USB drive so I could copy the files from my laptop. I created a folder called \"new folder\" and copied the files into it. While they were in the process of copying, I accidentally bumped the laptop and unsafely ejected the USB drive. When I re-inserted it, I used my mac search utility to search for \"new folder\" on the USB drive.\n\nA couple results showed up, and I clicked one. Suddenly, a stash of child porn. I'd say 13 pictures in total. Then, in a subfolder of that folder, another folder with more pictures that looked like child porn. None of these photos looked like they'd been taken by him, they looked like things he'd pulled off the internet. I looked at the image properties for one of the original 13 photos, it says the files were created in 1996. \n\nI copied the entire flashdrive's contents to my computer because I was about to go back home, and I didn't want to bring it up and then get stranded in a strange city with no way of getting back and little/no cash. \n\nShould I say something?

At the start of our relationship, when we were just getting to know each other, we talked about things like marriage, kids, etc. He was 100% set on eventually getting married to someone, having kids, the whole deal. I was less sure and was of the mindset of \"well, if I find the right person, I'll probably want to get married someday, I'm not sure yet.\"\n\nOne year later, and I thought everything was going great - I had fallen in love with him and realized that I wanted to marry him someday. Seeing as we'd been dating for a year and I knew he eventually wanted a family, I broached the subject a few weeks ago and confessed that I wanted to marry him eventually. I stressed the fact that I knew we weren't ready to get engaged yet, but that I did want to marry him someday. He sort of brushed the topic off and I thought nothing of it.\n\nI revisited the topic last weekend and we had a HUGE fight. He told me he doesn't want to marry me, and accused me of being desperate for a husband and just wanting to marry anyone, saying he felt used.\n\nI feel so horrible. Literally every boyfriend I've been serious with (serious here meaning being exclusive for at least three months) has told me he could see himself marrying me someday. I was the one to end each of those relationships because I didn't think I wanted to spend the rest of my life with them.\n\nI guess I'm just feeling stupid because I wasn't even sure about marriage until my current boyfriend came along, and now he's told me he doesn't want to marry me. I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nBreak up with him? Or keep dating him because he's kind, attractive, and enjoyable to be with even though I know it won't go anywhere?\nTL;DR:"}

Me and one other person left the room to scout the other groups leaving the rest to cook, the other groups were good, one entry was a pint of BLUE Guinness with a sea anemone stuffed into the top of the glass, served with a side of fried rice and apple pie. other people tried fish 'n' chips on a stick, I got to taste & critique. After our hour long absence we returned to see how our meal was coming on. When returned the food lay untouched in the centre of the table in it's bag, what ensued was an argument about 'What the fuck happened' I wont get into details but my sub-concious mind was very reasonable and took responsibility of the lack of the work I had done; yet also reprimanding the group that had failed to have any initiative.\nIt was then time for us to be judged, we hadn't done anything so we did the only logical thing, slam the door, which had somehow turned into a cupboard and so there were now shelves and food in there way as well, as they tried to scramble through I found my self holding a bowl of warm washing up water and promptly threw it on the invaders; and ran.\nThe rest of the groups filled the corridor and it became so crowded it was more like swimming that running, it was hard work but worth it to escape the judges.\nLater on I found my self on a bench opposite a group of emo chicks, with no idea of how I got there; a car pulls up and out steps Olivia Wilde, she motions to for me to so I naturally climb over the roof of the car and get in on the far side, as if it's the thing to do.

I was kind of taken aback by this but I defiantly wanted to. But being a dumbass, I asked her \"What changed?\" She then told me she was being sarcastic and that knowing her, I should've caught on. Since then we've been getting closer, we hang out almost every week and text everyday. She brings me baked goods like cookies and pancakes and then we just watch netflix all day. Although she rarely sits next to me when we do. Now a week or so ago she called me her best friend. I didn't know what to think, am I actually her best friend? How did this happen? She knows I like her, I've told her a few times before, it wasn't an all out love confession, just that I would like to be more than friends really. I've even asked her out to the movies but she told me she dislikes going to the movie theater. Fast forward to this week, we were texting like any other day and she asked me to a picnic with her next week. Complete with Burger King, mimosas and toking. Everything was fine and dandy, I'm totally thinking this is a date. You don't go on picnics just by ourselves if you're just friends, right? \nBut then today when we were planing on what else to bring she said \"It'll be an awesome best friends day.\" I know this post is all over the place and I'm not really sure what I'm looking for in posting this here but I really need some advice on how to handle this situation.

Some college, but didn't finish.\n\nI had found myself a position covering basically the tech-work of a real estate company at 19, and have put in a considerable amount of time in working here and getting my act together as my first year of college was a mess. Racked up debt, and this job paid very well, and was very comfortable because I was allowed to work from home. Only had to go to the office if they had an issue with something computer related, or I felt like it.\n\nI primarily got involved with data entry and Excel, as we had primarily focused on foreclosure properties. Setting up schedules for live auctions, also people to go out and survey properties was something uncommon for me to do, as well as manage accounts with very high value between investors and us. I also entered proxy bids for online sales, and managed title information, all in my PJs or comfort clothes for a majority of my day.\n\nI've paid off my debts, feel like I've gotten myself on the rails now correctly, and then I get hit with a complete panic at work. We've lost a major investor, and the people at the top had overextended us riding a gamble that this investor would reinvest for another year. I've been informed this is my final week.\n\nI'm stunned here. I've just gotten out of a rotten relationship of 5 years, and recently expressed an interest in going back to school, and now find myself in a pickle as Summer Semester courses are about to start. My parents have been extremely helpful in allowing me to rent our guesthouse, and I want to study Network Security at a community college. I feel financially I might be okay if I use what I've saved + financial aid/loans... but I don't know if I can balance work and school like I tried my first time, and I'm not sure I can find something for the pay I was getting at my old job.\n\nI'm sorry for using an obvious throw away and if I am rambling. I've been a complete mess since the news of my job and don't want to sit and sulk about it with school so close. I'm 42 credits into an AS degree for Network Security.\nTL;DR:"}

Any advice?\nPOST: I [M/23] recently met a girl online. We exchanged a few messages discussing hobbies, work, etc. and both affirming that we thought the other was cute. It seemed like we hit it off pretty well. She tells me she's in a bowling league for fun, and that there's a men's league, and I should join up. I told her I'm pretty bad at it, but I'd like to learn. She then says I should come to a practice and tells me when and where her team usually does them. I told her I would be there. When I showed up, she wasn't there, though people practicing knew her. Mild awkwardness ensued. I stuck around for a bit, because I was genuinely interested in learning, and the people were cool about it, then went home. When I got back, she was online, but I wasn't sure what to say (and am still not) so I just logged off and figured I'd sleep on it. \n\nSo here's my question: did I completely misread our conversation? It occurred to me that neither of us said anything like \"see you there\" or \"looking forward to meeting you\", though I just sort of assumed that she'd be there, considering she invited me. It seems pretty obvious that I just got stood up, but I was really beginning to like her, so I don't want to give up just yet if there's a chance it was just mis-communication. Kind of feel like, either way, it's her move. Thanks in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

Our relationship has been rocky over the past few months, but things have been good lately and we are both doing alright financially for the first time.\n\nI'm a full time student working part-time. He just started a small business and makes a decent amount of money from it. During the beginning of our relationship, he struggled with money and relied heavily on his family and I for support. \n\nI'm going away to college in the fall for 2 years and my parents are undertaking the financial burdens of that. I still have 10 credits left to take in community college before getting my transfer degree, and without financial aid for the summer, it's rather expensive for me. Around 1350. My parents offered me $500 and have asked me to pay for the rest. \n\nI asked my SO to help me out with this and he seems very hesitant. Recently, I have seen him drop quite a bit of money on random things that he doesn't really need. I would say in the past 2 weeks, he has spent 500 on purely random merchandise that was not crucially need in anyway. For example, an 120 dollar hand vacuum.\n\nNow, I'm not trying to be controlling with his pockets. It's his money and he's normally pretty responsible with it. I'm just upset that he seems hesitant to help me out with this, when money isn't much of a problem for him anymore. And for the greater half of our relationship, I helped him SO much. For example, we went on a trip to Vegas this past summer. My parents paid for the plane ticket, and they helped me pay for the hotel, living expenses, show tickets etc. He hardly contributed at all with that trip.\n\nHow can I communicate this to him without sounding like I'm trying to extort him? Which he even excused me of. He says that this is my parent's responsibility and I shouldn't give up so easily on that. He says that he should be a last resort.\nTL;DR:"}

A man's neck mysteriously snapped and there was nothing anyone could have done about it, apparently.\n\nI remember when the grand jury failed to indict Darren Wilson, people were furious because the prosecutor Robert McCulloch had presented the jury with a much greater quantity of testimony than is typical for or is even appropriate for a grand jury indictment hearing (for which I believe they only need to verify probable cause, a much lower standard to meet than beyond a reasonable doubt), and especially for presenting the testimony of an expert witness that provided testimony *in defense of* the ***defendant*** he was ***prosecuting***.  I am oversimplifying this quite a bit obviously.  But the point is, his conduct throughout the whole case called his impartiality into question.\n\nI am wondering if similar concerns were raised when it was known the trials of the officers so far would be bench trials.  Both the defense and prosecution have to agree to bypass the jury trial.  The judge alone hears the case and renders a verdict.\n\nCops and prosecutors rely on each other and build relationships just by the nature of their jobs, and many judges are former prosecutors.\n\nYou have an entire city that wants to see these officers guillotined in the streets on one hand, and on the other a [judge who coincidentally *is* a former prosecutor, though apparently he **did** prosecute police officers in the Justice Department at one point in his career]  Strategically, it seems like the prosecutors should not have accepted a bench trial if they were earnestly interested in convicting officer Goodson.  They instead relied on the input of one person in a position that stereotypically is inclined to \"take it easy\" on the police.\n\nSo I'm wondering if any lawyers here threw their hands up in exasperation as soon as they heard Goodson would get a bench trial and expected this exact outcome months out.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know how to approach this\nPOST: We've been dating for two years, and this only has become an issue as of late. I don't really drink all that much, and neither does she. However, in the last couple of months she's gone out for drinks with friends or family more than usual.\n\nShe almost never has gotten **drunk** (perhaps two or three times in the last two years), but when she's tipsy she becomes very needy and easily upset. If I don't pay enough attention to her and reciprocate her physical affection, she'll get progressively more demanding of my attention and moody. It's not a huge issue when we are home, but it can be an issue if we are out in public, particularly with friends. \n\nFor example, one time recently she went for dinner with a friend and then met me and some of my friends who were hanging out. She had already been drinking and had two more drinks with us. No big deal, except for the fact that she would be constantly trying to make out with me and have me talk to her regarding topics that were exclusive to us as a couple.\n\nWe talked about this particular situation, but there have been other instances that were more subtle (she was less inebriated) and she saw no issues with her behaviour. Also, since it happens very rarely over all, it doesn't affect us often and I don't know how to address it.\n\nI don't know what to do, **if** I should talk to her and if so **how** to do so.\nTL;DR:"}

I was messing around with it, just pulling back the slide until the functioning slide release locked it in place, reveling in how cool this replica was. (You can pretty much see where this is going) So I looked down the sights and dropped the magazine out of the gun, thinking it was well over the edge of his bed so it wouldn't slam into the floor, but instead fall harmlessly onto the fluffy mattress. It wasn't. I'm not that tall, but let me tell you, a full metal weighted magazine hurts like a bitch when it falls from my shoulderheight of about 5'5\" onto your foot. It hit my toe like a damn brick, and the numbness of the hit made me not even realize what had happened for a few seconds. I didn't scream cos his mom was home and I didn't want to freak her out, but I had to sit down for a while holding my toe that I assumed was probably broken. I couldn't really walk on it for the next week or two, and I asked my cousin (who is a licensed nurse) whether it was broken or not. She had a look at the black mark that had formed underneath the base of my toenail, and said \"No, it's just bruised. Don't worry, the toenail won't fall off or anything, but that black mark will take about 6-8 months to go away. It'll move up the toenail very slowly.\"\nTL;DR:"}

I had a great time and am really interested in him. I would love to see him more often. Now, i consider myself attractive. I have a really pretty face, but I'm rather curvy and plump for lack of a better description. Still, attractive enough. People stop and stare all the time. He, however, is super fit, like a damn model. He pulled me over to cuddle with him and couldn't keep his hands off me. Like aforementioned, we had sex 3 times. I feel like if he didn't like me, he probably wouldn't have done that. He's not desperate,  he obv has no trouble getting girls. Before we hung out, we talked rather often. Every day, multiple times.

We have been dating for a bit now and I tend to notice some things about her when we get into fights\n\nFor example, today she asked me to come over. Its finals week and she has 2 finals tomorrow and made it clear when I talked to her on the phone that she will be studying most of the night. I asked her if she wanted me to still come over cause it seemed pointless and then she got upset at me. She basically hung up on me and gets super mad like it is my fault. \n\nShe has exhibited behavior like this and also gets vindictive. If I accidentally or unintentionally do something that gets her upset she feels the need to get even with me. Now that just doesn't sit well with me cause that's not how relationships should work you gotta love someone unconditionally and forget the little fuck ups(in my mind at least). She mentions the old adage of \"happy gf happy life\" and it kinda pisses me off cause I don't think that is fair either, both partners need to be happy and compromise. I feel like all she wants is her opinion in a deeper voice most the time.\n\nI am growing concerned as she has begun talking about a future with me. Not that I am uninterested in that, but these glaring signs and miscommunications have me kinda put off and worried.\nTL;DR:"}

He, on the other hand, always manages to find something terrible to give me even though we share similar interests. And the hints I drop are useless because he will often buy the gifts months in advance.  \n\nThe fact that the gifts are terrible isn't what bothers me (\"it's the thought that counts\", right?), it's that he seems to put zero effort into them. \n\nThe latest example:  Last month I emailed him links to two pieces of (not remotely geeky) art I was interested in.  So what does he get me for Xmas?  Two Star Wars themed art prints, unframed.  He chose these for me knowing very well that I am in no way a Star Wars fanboy (neither is he) and that I really dislike geeky-themed art or decorations, even though I like movies/gaming. \n\nFor my birthday last summer he bought me a Doctor Who-themed screwdriver (neither of us are big Doctor Who fans) and a scratching post for my cat, identical to the scratching post I had just recently purchased.  \n\nI'm always gracious when I open the gifts, but I almost always feel cheated especially after making sure to buy him something he'll like.  Sometimes it will sour my mood for the rest of the evening.  On two occasions, days after receiving a gift, I gave it back to him saying that I'm sorry but I really don't like it and it's just going to spend forever in a drawer so he might as well return it.  In those instances he seemed genuinely disappointed that I didn't like them, but then just returned them and didn't get me a \"replacement\" gift , which made me feel worse.  It makes me feel like I'm not worth the effort.\nTL;DR:"}

When I suggested that we move the plans to another day this week, my boyfriend again said he was busy. \n\nAt this point, I could tell my boyfriend was getting uncomfortable and I askds him flat out if he was uncomfortable with me meeting my friend. I told him to tell me truthfully and I wouldn't be offended with what he had to say. But he said no and didn't care that I hung out with my friend. Then he went on to say some passive things about how he didn't want to bother us and how he was sure we had a lot to catch up on.\n\nI want my boyfriend to understand that my friend and I are just that, friends. I see my friend as a brother and he sees me as his sister. We've known each other for close to four years and have maintained our friendship and nothing more throughout. I don't know any other way to show my boyfriend this, without having us all hang out together and both of them getting to know each other. But my boyfriend isn't open to that suggestion. \n\nI really care for my boyfriend and don't ever want to do anything to hurt his feelings or make him feel insecure, but I also don't want to abandon my friends because my boyfriend isn't comfortable with them. I tried to start this conversation again with my boyfriend, but he keeps on saying there's nothing to talk about and he doesn't care. But obviously from his body language and tone he doesn't like the idea. \n\nLastly, what is really getting to me is that he has girls sending him pictures daily on Snapchat of themselves and he has really good girl friends that he goes to lunch with.

He's depressed and I don't know what else to do.\nPOST: The other night my boyfriend got into some legal trouble and incredibly upset about it. He's so depressed he will break down into tears or just lay in bed all day and sleep, and not say much to anyone if they talk to him. He just stares blankly all day. I've asked him what I can do to make him feel better, I'm willing to do anything to just see him smile for 5 seconds. He tells me to just \"be\" and just be there. He wants me around him, but he tells me not to try and cheer him up and let him be upset. I totally understand that and I know sometimes people just need to be upset in order to move on. The problem is, him and I have been in a similar situation before. He was in a horrible accident in the summer of '11 and was basically physically useless for an entire year and lost a lot of independence because of it. I did everything I could to help him and make him feel better about the situation but he just stayed in the depression. When he is upset, he takes it out on the one he is closest to, just like everyone else does. That person is me. During the time he was hurt, he was absolutely horrible to me. I would say he treated me like garbage, but he even treated that better. It was just about the end of us. I stayed with him because I knew why he was doing it and I knew I would probably do the same thing, and if he lost his girlfriend along with all of the things he already lost, God only knows where he'd be today. I'm scared that if this legal issue doesn't go the way we want it to, he will go back into the depression he was once in and I don't know if I can handle that. Someone can only be around someone who is so upset before it makes them miserable also, and then you've got even bigger issues. I love him more than I can put into words, but I just need to know what I can do here for him, myself, and our relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

I had just gotten off work, and was dropping off my rent check. It's at a house that has been renovated into a small property management company. All the tenants drop their checks in the mail slot on the front porch. I pulled up in front of the sidewalk just in front of the house. Now I'm a repairman, so I drive a white service van with no windows. I sat there a few minutes and wrote out my check. Out the corner of my eye, I saw a car pull into the driveway, directly between me and the house. I thought nothing of it. Soon as i finished the check I got out of the van, and started walking quickly up to the house. I saw a woman on the dimly lit porch dropping her check in the slot. I waved at her to be friendly, since we'd be walking right by each other in a few moments. Midwave I realized this was not a woman, but a young girl. Like maybe 10 years old. At the same time she saw me and stopped dead in her tracks. I looked at the car to my right, and saw her father frantically waving her to the car. It was only then that i realized how this looked. A large man sitting in a windowless van at night, suddenly gets out and starts walking quickly towards a young girl, all the while waving. Now I'm not scary looking, but i can be physically intimidating. \n In a sudden panic I took the rent check out of my pocket and pointed at it, trying to signal to the father that I wasn't a threat. But he was too busy trying to get his daughter in the car to see me. So I just walked past and dropped my check in the box. Then got back in my van, feeling like an asshole for scaring a little girl. I'm sure he saw me drop the check in, and noticed that i was not in fact a kidnapper. But it still felt pretty shitty even for a moment.\nTL;DR:"}

We took it in, cleaned it up (had flea infection / ring worms etc) and just had it neutered (about 1 month ago). \n\nThe problems we have been is both of us have work for most of the day so the cat is being left alone for about 8 hours a day at least and right as we get home we have other things to do besides just playing with the cat for an hour or more at a time.  This I believe has led the cat to act crazy and he has taken to biting and attacking our feet (he always did this even when he was little but just didnt notice it as much cause he was tiny).  \n\nIs there any way to teach the cat that biting is wrong (we have tried the spray bottle, clapping, saying no, ignoring the cat, all which work sometimes but usually just goes back to the old behavior) or that we cant play as much as he wants to or is the only thing we can do just wait it out until the cat is older (how old would he have to be to get out of this phase? )\n\nThanks for all the help you can give me, sorry for this long question.\nTL;DR:"}

A lot of people knows about it now. Should I tell him? And how?\nPOST: Hey.\nLike 5 months ago my best friend, which is in a relationship, made out with this other random girl but he doesn't remember anything because he was really drunk. A couple of my friends saw what happened and told me about it. \n\nWe decided that since we were the only ones that knew about it we would keep it our secret and not tell him or her about it. Our reasoning was that since we were the only ones that knew about it and this girl was a random girl out of town, nobody would find out and we would save their relationship for a lot of hassle. \n\nThey're been together for four years, are deeply in love, and will probably marry in a couple of years. He is very honest, and I could never picture him doing this, and he would never do this sober. He was extremely drunk, like black-out drunk. If we tell him he will 100 % for sure tell his girlfriend what he did, and then their relationship will be fucked up, and maybe even over. \n\nWell, it gets worse. Yesterday I heard from another friend that the rumor about what happened has spread out to other people. One of my friends that knew about it from the beginning (that promised to keep it a secret) told his own girlfriend (not my cheating friends girlfriend) about it, and she couldn't shut up and told more people. So now at least 10 people knows about it!\n\nI feel like I have to tell him about it now because it will probably come out to him sooner or later anyways. I feel like he deserves to know what he did so he can solve it with his girlfriend before it comes to her before he knows. Or should I? his girlfriend moved to another country 2 months ago, but she knows a couple of people here, and if they find out it is a probability that they'll tell her. \n\nAny suggestions about what I should do here?\nTL;DR:"}

When the original order was made he was ordered to pay ~$300 a month.

He also doesn't care for the children ever, maybe a day here and there but no more than 5% of the time do the kids spend with him.\n\nFinancially I could use the help, I've been able to support myself and my kids but money is tight and I would like to be able to save more money than I have been.

I'm sure this probably started to happen from me allowing it to happen. I'm a very laid back person. If my SO brought up hanging out with friends or asked me to stay another week in town with her or really for anything, I'd do all I could to make what she wanted happen because I love her.

We play games and stuff together and I try to help her if shes having trouble and she freaks out if anybody tries to help her, including me, to the point where she can yell. And if were not playing together and I'm doing something alone, I get begged and begged and begged to drop what I'm doing and give her attention, even if I have spent all day long with her. I love spending time with her but it gets kind of frustrating when i just want a little time to do things for me, even if its 10 minutes.\n\nI dont know what to do.

I would not say that it was love at first sight, but I slowly fell in love with her. We have both similar and different interests. I really have no reason why I love her but the feeling is there. We bonded over the few days helping her during camp, talking about our lives outside school. After camp, we barely see each other as we take different subjects in school. I take mostly science subjects and she takes graphic arts and stuff like that. I am a graphic designer and do art and intros for people on Steam and YouTube (yes, I get paid and not a self proclaimed one), that's pretty much what we have in common. I saw her in the hallways a few times last week, we did not talk but just greeted each other with a smile. Last Friday, we had a conversation after school alone. I think that she showed some interest from a particular sentence she said. The problem is that my \"friend\" whom hates me for some unknown reason probably has a crush on her too.

I recently broke up with a long term boyfriend who was constantly abusing me. I was often a larger female, but during our 8 year relationship I went from size 12-18 in female clothing. A lot of that has to do with maturity, leaving home, etc, but my goal is to get back to where I was.\n\nI started going to the gym again this past week. On Monday I did 30 minutes on a recumbent bike and 15 on the elliptical. On Thursday I did 30 minutes on a recumbent bike and 20 on the elliptical; I also added some stretching after feeling calf soreness in heels the next day. Otherwise I haven't experienced much pain, though. I think that is likely due to the amount of walking I do/my occasional long distance bicycling in the summer.\n\nI know I should drink more water and less/(eliminate?) diet coke. I know I need to eat more vegetables and proteins. In theory, these things all make sense, but I would be lying if I said I hadn't tried before and failed. I am not sure if that has to do with my refusal to purchase/use a scale until now.\n\nRight now my weight is 239.8lb, height 5'9\", I look like [this] [this] and [this] I feel in a rush to lose this weight so I can be more confident in the dating world (counselling is helping the abuse part, but it's not helping me like what I see when I take off my clothing). I have been noticing a heightened sex drive after leaving the relationship and it would be nice to act on it on occasion. \n\nI wonder if there is anyone out there who could give me further advice about what workouts I should do (how often/what kind), how to reduce without binge eating, and how to continue to motivate myself through what is proving to be a very difficult year of my life (school, single life, etc).\n\nThank you for any help you can give.\nTL;DR:"}

The problem apparently this steroid can cause someone to become bipolar if they have a predisposition towards it.  Without the proper help (which he is refusing) it can become permanent.\n\nFlashback a week ago things he started to seem off.  Lists of everything started to appear.  In the last week he has gone into a full mania.  Post it notes on the walls of the house, he is recording everything via his phone, apparently we don't need a shower curtain anymore?  It's just getting wackier and wackier.   Apparently he can read the minds of those around him.  He also is constantly rambling about how he is going to sell his story to Vice. \n\nSo all in all, the lease was up on our place in august.  Currently I'm not on the lease at all, just a resident of the house.  I had already planned to move out and have everything planned yet may need to speed the process up.  I'm having a moral dilemma thought as I'm not trying to fuck the guy over but at the same time I can't live with him.  He's refusing help from all sources and we've really been trying, every time we get him close to going to a psyche ward he bails.  It's getting actually scary to be around alone at the house as he's now starting to lash out and exhibit anger at those things around him.  Do I pay rent for June and then bail even though I won't be staying there? Or do I just flat out bail and leave the situation.  Mind you in our situation we've never really been super close and the whole time I've lived there he's kind of been a dickhead to me in general, but we share a lot of mutual friends.\nTL;DR:"}

I usually wait for him to offer to talk about it and if he shows no interest in reconciling I will go home. \n\nHe, on the other hand, gets angry and aggressive. He avoids me at first and if I try to talk to him he blows up. I cannot communicate with him when he is like this, I can't even stand to be around him. He says that he tries to reach out to me, but apparently in very subtle ways that I don't pick up on when I'm upset. He also gets very bitter and never apologizes anymore, even after admitting to being in the wrong.\n\nThe strange part is, we have a fantastic relationship otherwise.

We have a lot in common and he is an all around great guy. I have so much fun with him and he makes me incredibly happy. Our sex life is pretty good except he won't go down on me. Now this is a HUGE deal for me since it is very hard for me to orgasm unless it's through oral. He won't even try it. He says it's disgusting and not something he will EVER consider but is perfectly fine with me going down on him.\n\nAs much as I like him, I want to break up with him over this. We have talked about it a lot but he just is not willing to do this for me. I don't want to be with someone who isn't willing to pleasure me so I feel like there's no point to the relationship. I am young and know I could meet other people. The only thing that gives me pause is that I told some of my friends about it and they wrote me off as petty and not \"mature enough\" for a relationship if I would break it off because of just this.\n\nNormally, I wouldn't care and would just do what I wanna do but for some reason this has been really weighing on me. Our relationship is pretty close to perfect: my friends/family likes him, he's supportive, makes me happy, and is cute to boot. He just is grossed out by giving oral. Everyone seems to think I'm crazy for breaking it off with him over this. What I guess want from reddit is to have my feelings validated so I can breakup with him without feeling crazy. So, is this worth breaking up over?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: Introversion is not a disorder. It is a personality trait.\nPOST: For the sake of context the inspiration for this post comes from a conversation I overheard between two Midwestern women, one of them being the grandmother and legal guardian of a teenager on a trip I went on recently. The teenager spent most of her time on her laptop, chilling out in her cabin. I was passing by and heard the grandmother explaining this to the trip organizer saying, \"She has introversion...\" To which I quipped: \"Really? I have introversion, too.\"\n\t\nReflecting on it later, the way she said it, she might as well have said, \"She has mono...\" or \"She has leprosy...\" and I realized that there must be some misconceptions out there about people with introverted personality traits. Dr. David Keirsey contrasts extraversion and introversion using a battery analogy. When extraverts are socially engaged it stimulates them and 'charges their batteries' but when they are only in the company of their self the batteries run out of juice only to be recharged by more social stimulation. Introverts are the opposite in the sense that their 'batteries' are drained by social interaction and recharged by solitude and introspection. One is not necessarily better than the other, it is simply something that makes us individuals. \n\t\nIt is possible to make introversion or even extraversion, for that matter, stigmatic but I believe that should be avoided. It takes all kinds of people to make the world go 'round and any attempt at trying to create and/or emulate an ideal type of personality temperament would be a major disservice to the Homo Sapien species. Unless, of course, it is Vulcanization of the Human race. Live long and prosper.\nTL;DR:"}

It was before I met his parents and he would go to visit on his own. They hooked up a couple of times. I know this 100%, but he denies it to this day.\n\nRecently, I saw some texts on his phone indicating he and a co-worker are up to something. They have feelings for each other, but would never date. They have hooked up in the past. About the same time as the texts, his total demeanor changed. He became withdrawn from me for several weeks and just wasn't himself. He admitted something was bothering him, but said he didn't want to talk about it. I flat out asked him if something was going on between them. He said no. Ever since, his phone gets wiped on a regular basis.\n\nI just wish he would admit to one or both so we can work through things and move on. Right now, I am always paranoid. I don't go on weekend trips with the girls or even out to dinner with a friend because I am afraid if I don't keep a constant eye on him he is going to do something. It is so hard to live this way, and I can't always be here. Lately he is encouraging me to go on some of these trips/dinners, which he never used to do.\n\nWe have been together for 8 years and living together for 7. Outside of the cheating (and lying about it) he is a wonderful guy and I love him very much.

I and my boyfriend decided to pack lunches so that we could avoid both the money and calories of eating out for lunch. Of course, this still left dinner.\n\nDinner yesterday wound up being a pot luck with a *lot* of good food. I went through the line and my plate wound up loaded down--hash browns, a cheddar biscuit, veggies and a small bit of ranch dressing, one small piece of bread. Then there was the dessert table... I have a huge weakness for cheesecake. I'll admit that right out. So knowing that if I didn't get a piece now it'd be gone, I couldn't wait to see if I was still craving it after eating dinner--I came back to get a small dessert plate and grab a piece. At that exact time, someone's homemade macaroni and cheese came out of the oven and looked *heavenly*. So I got a small bowl of that.\n\nSounds like a lot of food, right? Well, I sat down and looked at my food and was appalled because yes, it *was* a lot of food. We ate, we danced (we danced a *lot*; we danced for three hours once the tables were all cleared...), and came home. Later that evening I was logging in my food when I realized...\n\n\"Wait, is that really all I ate?\" I'd only eaten the macaroni and cheese, the veggies, and the cheesecake. I hadn't realized it because there was lots of conversation and entertainment during dinner, and I'd stopped eating when I felt full. Sure, it's not the healthiest of meals, but I honestly had thought I'd eaten twice that and that, even with the exertion of dancing, I was going to be over my calorie count for the day!\nTL;DR:"}

He recently failed two classes and just had to drop one because he was already failing (4 weeks into the term).

The problem is that he comes up with these miraculous plans to make things better but he can never follow through, this problem bleeds into other areas of his life as well.\n\n  I though he was doing better. I ask him frequently how things are going, how was class, how are you feeling? and it has seemed like everything was fine.

I work a good job that pays $21,000 a year, and I am now receiving child support. That wasn't always the case. I am sleeping on a mattress on the floor, I need two hearing aids but can't buy them, and in general don't buy myself things as I don't have it in the budget.\n\nMy parents on the other hand are millionaires, own many properties and still make around $300,000/year.\n\nI borrowed money from my parents over the last decade to help pay for things for my kids, such as glasses or urgent medical care when I didn't have insurance. It has added up to a couple thousand dollars.

My mother thinks this stems from a lack of \"true\" love, saying if our relationship was truly strong it would survive such long distance. I'm not saying it would be a deal breaker, I'm just aware of how hard the military lifestyle is and I'm just not sure how or if I'd cope with the time apart.

Long story short 4 years ago I was about $40,000 deep in credit card debt and struggling to get by each month. Somehow I did, without any late payments, and I've been working on digging myself out since things got better.\n\nPresently I've whittled it down to $26,000 in debt which is on a debt management plan. Prior to the DMP my debts were at 19% - 29%, they are currently at 6% - 9% on the plan. On top of that, my only other debt is a car loan with a balance of about $8,500 at an interest rate of 16.49%.\n\nI'm now in a position to aggressively tackle this debt and get it done in the next year or two and be free. The question I have is where to start... The typical advice would be highest interest first, which makes sense, however in this case it would mean paying off the auto loan before paying off closed credit card accounts on a DMP. For some reason I find this hard to do, because it seems like the car loan (though at a terrible interest rate) is 'acceptable' debt, whereas the credit cards are bad debt. \n\nThe other factor is that the place I am currently renting is for sale. It's entirely possible that someone could buy it, and kick me out to live here, or try to jack the rent up. I have no plans to use my credit score for a while, but if I ended up having to move I may need it. My score is currently about 680. I feel like lowering the credit card debt would do more to improve my credit score than paying off the car loan would, but I don't know if that's actually true or not.\nTL;DR:"}

So this morning I woke up to a bit of a shock. My step-sister, Elena, posted on a group on Facebook asking if anyone could stay in her room (we rent out a two bedroom unit) for the duration of nearly all June, when our break starts. The catch? She didn't even ask me or tell me anything about this at all. She's been doing stuff like this for a while, mostly minor stuff like using my charger without asking, eating my food, etc. But I feel like this is the last straw. Our lease probably ends in December or so (12 month lease, signed in February). I've wanted out for a long time now. \n\nMy friend, Sandy knows about this, and I want to move in with her and her husband ASAP but at the moment she's waiting until her brother (who stays with them) moves out and that could be anywhere from a month or so. I'm incredibly upset and honestly more dumbfounded that my step sister could do something like this just for a job, to me. I've discussed it with my parents but I feel like they're not taking this seriously enough.\nTL;DR:"}

One of his friends took an interest in me, and we started talking to each other. As the night went on, both of us got a bit tipsy (5 drinks max), and started getting fairly touchy-feely with each other.\n\n(I should mention one of my friends who doesn't drink, and would never lie to me, saw this girl tell a friend that she was interested in me.) \nWe were basically sitting down, cuddling with each other and holding hands saying stuff like \"you're cute, you're beautiful, etc.\" with each other for a few hours. It was quite intimate. However, after a while, we drifted apart and began to socialise with others, and she started to ignore me.\n\nBefore we got to sleep, I asked her what all the behaviour earlier in the night was for, and she responded \"Well, we were drunk.\" We didn't talk that much the next morning.\n\nI'm wondering if asking her out for coffee would be a good idea.

Nobody else in the room. For five seconds I forget what I even was going to ask him (something about the final for his class or other).

She hasn't worked in 4 months and I take care of everything and I don't mind, but she hasn't made much of an effort to get one and seems to not realize how much I do for bills and us to get by. Right now she says shes trying to not be upset so I can just show her love. \n\nI try to talk to her and be with her but she says that I am not doing it right and needs to be treated special and needs extra attention and says that its words she needs, and I don't know what words to say to her because I feel like I try so hard, but what that's the main issue is that she gets sad that I get mad when she gets her feelings hurt and we go through this whole ordeal again.  It really makes it harder to continue when it happens so much.  What am I suppose to say to her to let her know I really do care.

So in the evening, Mark took Mike's laptop hid it and interrogated Mike for an hour and refused to return the computer until he'd admitted he was guilty.  He said stuff like \" I know you did it.\"  \" If you want to find your computer, I threw it out the window.\" \n\n I'd never heard Mark be abusive like this towards someone before.  We'd actually gotten along excellently as roommates before.  I pretty much sat silently as Mark interrogated Mike for an hour until Mark finally gave back the laptop.

We also are in a small major and will have many classes together in our future.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by smoking legal marijuana, losing cognitive function and receiving 100 mosquito bites.\nPOST: To begin, this all occurred in August during a cross country road trip with my buddy and his girlfriend. After a couple weeks of driving we found ourselves in the great state of Colorado near the city of Durango. We met with a kind friend who bought us breakfast and offered to take us to the local hot springs. Our host warned us that the spring was R-rated, meaning clothing was optional and smoking was allowed. We arrived at the spring and decide to keep our clothes on, but plan on returning that evening to get naked and tipsy. Fast forward to that evening at our campground. I drank approx. 6.0 oz. of vodka (I've always been very precise when drinking spirits because of a few rough experiences) then my buddy drives us to the local dispensary. I hate smoking and have almost always had negative effects after hitting a joint, but I really wanted to see a dispensary. Unfortunately, by the time we left with the joints the alcohol had set in and I became game for anything. We arrived at the springs, stripped down, and headed out to the smoker pool.  We smoked the joints and I almost immediately began to feel the psychological effect. Moments later I was overcome with the feeling that life was futile and I was going to die. Most likely due to the heat of the pool intensifying the effects of THC and alcohol. I decided lying down in the soft grass would calm my increasing anxiety. I do so and completely fall asleep. Over the next hour I occasionally awake to the sounds of kids laughing, but I was way too out of it to have any idea what was going on. Later my friends told me the front desk was giving tours to families and my incapacitated, nude body was most likely costing them business. To make matters worse a swarm of mosquitoes was having a feast on my naked back, buttocks, and legs. I finally woke up to the sensation of water dripping off my body. To my horror I realize the sensation was mosquitoes. I get up make a fool of myself in front of my friends and another group in the pool then they take me back to my tent.\nTL;DR:"}

I felt it was inappropriate and now we are arguing.\nPOST: Throwaway\n\nToday, my GF and I were driving in a busy area of town. At a very busy intersection, a lady and her BF were broken down and were trying to get their car to start. While doing so, the larger looking lady, who was wearing a very short dress, was bent over and we (and the rest of the world) could see her underwear/butt/crotch, etc. My GF asked for my phone so she could take a picture to laugh at later and I asked that we not do that as I felt it was inappropriate. We then got into an argument about this situation. \n\nHer rationale for the argument is that, and I'm paraphrasing, \"Normally...we are both polite, politically correct, kind people. At times, we share inappropriate jokes about others amongst each other. \nJust today we were joking about a robust woman and her lack of neck and then continued to make fun of her clown makeup. Also, we watch EVERYTHING on efukt together. We laugh at people ALL THE TIME but it's just between us.\"\n\nShe finds it hypocritical for me to seem appalled by her wanting to take a secret picture of a woman bent over in a very short skirt with her \"Britney\" hanging out for the world to see, but be okay with laughing at the pornstars on efukt or the people at Walmart. She states that she \"just finds it to be a contradiction to the nature of our humor--especially since we wouldn't be doing it if the person was aware.\" She feels its okay for me to not \"participate\" but not okay for me to say she can't. \n\nAm I being overly sensitive or unjustified?\nTL;DR:"}

Little problems with intimacy have popped up constantly throughout our whole 6 year relationship but that's not exactly the point here, just the backstory. \n\nAnyway, the yesterday we're texting and she asks me if I'm bored of her or wish she had other qualities. This girls the love of my life and my future wife, so I immediately say no and ask her why. One of the things she brings up is \"with physical stuff, I know you wish I did certain things\" For some reason, whenever she feels guilty about certain things it always me feel bad and because of that I try to direct blame away from her. So, I tell that it's ok if we're not doing certain physical things right now, as I'm patient with her. Her reply to that was \"I know. And that's the thing. We are only 20 years old.

I want us to stay together forever.\"\n\nI don't know why, but as soon as she said that it immediately bugged me.

She had just gotten out of a long relationship when we first got together, but things seemed to be going really well even if it was a bit fast. Then she found out her ex already has a new girlfriend, and she realized she's not ready to be with anyone. She was up front and honest with me about the fact that she wants to give me the best chance I can, and right now she can't do that and she doesn't want to string me along. She's told me this isn't an excuse for her to go off with a bunch of other guys looking for something better, she wants to focus on herself for a while. I honestly do feel we still have a shot in the future, it'll just take some time for her to figure herself out.\nI've realized we can't hang out as much or text as much as we used to since I need to give her space. In terms of hanging out, I think we'll hang out occasionally and it'll be fine, we're just no longer gonna be like \"I'm bored, come over and hang out\". I've gotten used to texting her almost all day, but now I've got to dial that back. How much should I dial it back? I don't want there to be no texting, I still want to talk to her to be her friend and also show I'm still interested in her, while also giving her space. \n\nShe's been away this past week, so she told me all this stuff about needing to figure herself out while she was there. When she comes back, I know we're gonna discuss all this and figure out our hanging out/texting situation, she's made it clear she still wants to do all that as well. The best thing I could come up with is that I'd try and check in every day just to see how her day is going, talk to her a little bit at the end of each day or something.

I have a good friend whose behavior has always been somewhat of a mystery to me. I've had similarly nagging, idle concerns in the past regarding his always overtly flirtatious/salacious jokes, but typically I've been able to write it off as him joking around and being entirely facetious. This time, however....\n\nHe and I got reasonably tipsy on Saturday night while watching a film. We sat next to each other on the couch. No big deal, right? At some point, I start to feel his hand brushing up against mine. Again, no big deal. But then his fingers start to move against mine with clear purpose. Eventually, we end up sitting there holding hands, fingers interlocked and everything, gently stroking the skin of each others' hands with our thumbs. He even got up at one point and when he sat back down, the hand holding started right back up. \n\nLater on, we went to look at something together and he offered for me to sit on his knee. Being equally tipsy, I took him up on the offer. At some point he ended up resting his head on my chest (read: boobs). \n\nNow, I'm totally open to the idea that these were just drunken displays of deep platonic affection. But something about the way in which all of the above events transpired has me second guessing my inherent notion to just write this off.\nTL;DR:"}

A month or so ago, the exact same situation. That time, I did my best to play it off: I suggested that we take a sexy shower together, so we hopped in and soaped up and continued the encounter there. \n\nReddit, should I address this with her? Should I ignore it unless it happens a third time? I'm concerned about her hygiene. She frequently gets UTIs; is it possible that this is a contributing factor (or the main reason for them)?

I have been having mixed feelings about the relationship and it doesn't help that I work with someone and have a bit of a crush (I have no inclination to date that person, just very, very attracted). I feel like I've found someone pretty great, the type of person I could be with for a long time but, I'm 20 and settling down after 2 years of dating seems impossible partially since I can see a point in the future where we may head in quite different directions (I'm leaving school 2 years before him).\n\nI just can't figure out if I should keep plugging at it or if I should try and let go. I want to be free but at the same time I'm not ready to let go at all. I just feel like the timing is so off.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [17M] with my annoyance [17M]. I have to decide whether to keep the status quo or finally tell him he is an asshole.\nPOST: So I will try to compress alot of the events. Basically last school year M(The annoyance) was in our circle of friends. I never really liked him to begin with because he was way too nosy into my girlfriend and I's relationship but that's separate. So last year he had a crush on a girl in our circle and asked her out. She denied him and he went berserk. He convinced half the people in the group she must be depressed because what other reason would there be for her to not love him right?\n\nSo basically during that time he sent a huge message swearing at a different girl in the group for taking the crush's side. That text was sent unprovoked by the girl I might add.\n\nAfter that he kept complaining to me about it and how Catholicism gave his crush a \"Holier than thou\" complex. He then let me know he was depressed and when I offered help he cussed me out too.\n\nI then told my girlfriend all of this and she never took a side and said we were both in the wrong. He still remains thinking he was the only right one and that something I did was wrong.\n\nHere's the dilemma: This entire time I've been acting like I get along with him as to not start any more drama but I read over the messages again a few weeks ago when clearing out my mail and realized I was a doormat the entire time. He is coming to an event tomorrow where the entire group will be(Including the crush, the other girl, my girlfriend, and I) and is going to act friendly towards me. I've decided I'm not a doormat and I want to let out all the rage I've had stored up from the event and tell him how much of an asshole he is and that no person who could call themselves christian would have done that to another person(He is quite religious, He tried to convert me twice). The other part of me says don't start anything more and just leave it but I cant let him keep thinking how he acted was okay. Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

Anytime a girl talks to me or anything, she gets super upset and starts telling me to not talk to them or be friends with them.\n\nShe says I shouldn't be giving any attention to other girls except for her but she doesn't do the same for me, which makes me insanely jealous and leads me to snooping her Facebook at times because I feel as if she has something to hide and when she knows I've looked at her Facebook, she gets upset.\n\nOnce I found her saying yes to meeting up with a guy I had issues with and he was saying he loves her but as a friend, although a few months prior, he had confessed his feelings for her.\n\nWhat can I do to stop feeling jealous or caring about all this bs because I'm not allowed female friends which I'm fine with but she gets all defensive and doesn't listen when I ask her not to talk to one or two guys out of however many there are. It's really getting on my nerves.\nTL;DR:"}

I decided to go home and change before my English lesson and took the bus home (The space between the seats on the buses in my city are too small for my liking, I can't sit completely straight). When I got on, the bus was pretty empty, and I got on and sat on the right hand side with my right leg wedged in between the seat in front (knee raised so it was about chin height) and had my other leg sprawled across the seat next to me. I put in my headphones and started listening to music. About halfway through my journey a woman sat on the seats parallel to mine but I didn't pay her much attention as I was on my phone. When I looked up to see where the bus was, I noticed the woman giving me funny looks and when I went back to my phone I could see her giving me the same looks out of the corner of my eye. Eventually she got off the bus, with me getting off a couple of stops later. When I got off I felt a breeze between my legs. It was then I realised what I'd done, the way I had been sitting meant the woman could see right into the crotch tear in my jeans. To make matters worse, my dick had wriggled free from my boxers, meaning this woman had an excellent view of Chocolate Thunder for her entire journey.\n\nNote: I know this has a hint of r/bigdickproblems, but it I think it belongs here.\nTL;DR:"}

All of my life I've wanted to help out my community and eventually everyone I possibly can. I'm a fairly young guy and I have a 4 year old son, a beautiful wife, and a baby on the way. I'm starting down a path of no return with a good corporate job, working as a middleman between the business and IT in a utility company. I'm very fortunate to have a good job and I'm very thankful to be in my current situation.\n\nBut I've had one major life goal growing up and that is to help out fellow man, charity organizations, and everyone that I can. I woke up one night filled with a lot of anxiety about what I'm doing in my life to help better the lives of others (something more than giving donations at church and canned food to food shelters). I just don't feel like I'm living up to my goals working for a utility company. While working at my current job, I've ran into another guy (we're both long time redditors) with the same aspirations and life goals and we want to start working towards our goals but are limited on how to successfully transition into a small business. We've been discussing this a while now.\n\nWe want to create a small agricultural business that will help out the environment along with other people (not farming outright but multiple ways). We want to teach others through how we run the business. Of course, we both want to be able to keep paying for our families and stay responsible fathers/husbands. We eventually want to have this as our full-time passion.\n\nWe want to ask our fellow redditors that have started small businesses or other companies for tips, guidance, mentoring, etc. We're not asking for money or up votes, just sincere advice and guidance. I know that you all will help out fellow redditors in our community. Thanks everyone!\nTL;DR:"}

I was really shocked, didn't really know how to react at first and just said \"that's really bad\" in a kind of neutral tone.\n\nWe started arguing, her argument being that it's the boyfriend's responsibility + they were in unhappy relationships anyway, my point was that she should have been the better person and she didn't have to do it.\n\nMy problem wasn't so much that it happened I suppose.. but the fact that she didn't care, not once in our whole discussion did she really show any signs of caring or feeling bad about it and I suppose it hurt me. She's someone I'm in love with, respect and care about and wouldn't think she would do something like that.

How much should I expect to spend on insurance?\nPOST: I'm a 23 year old female Australian, with a NSW Gold License and no at-fault accidents. I have no debts (have never taken out a loan) and earn $30000 a year. \n\nMy dream car has been the Camaro - ever since I first laid eyes on it, I wanted it to be mine one day. The only way to get it here, however, is to import it and convert it to right-hand drive. I'm aware just getting the car will be expensive, I will likely have to take out a loan. \n\nWhat I don't know, is how much insurance will be for it. I imagine it being an imported car, and me being under 25, it'll be quite expensive. I drive a VY Commodore wagon now, and it costs me $1100 per year for registration and compulsory insurance. I pay $70 per month for comprehensive on it. There is absolutely no way I'm not getting comprehensive coverage for *any* car, much less a Camaro. \n\nI wanted to get any information I could about the cost of insuring a car like this. I see the occasional Ram and F-series Ford trucks, so I know importing and converting is possible, but I know nothing about the cost of it. It's not something I want to blindly charge headfirst into. \n\nIf anyone has any knowledge I'd greatly appreciate it.\nTL;DR:"}

I did get annoyed at things she did, but we always hugged it out afterwards.\n\nOn the last day of our weeks together, she told me about our future, about our kids names and about plans. This was a sunday and on the Wednesday after she broke up with me for a number of reasons, she wanted someone more compatible, she didn't feel like I brought the best out of her and that she wasn't feeling fulfilled.\n\nI have to mention that I think there is another guy, we live in a big city in Canada, so we can go places easily and get around well. This guy works with her all the time and has the same passions as her, I asked her about her feelings and she kept them from me to 'avoid hurting me'. I think if she spoke up, we really could've worked on us!

We reported it, and she took it down. Tonight my brother heard noises outside, looked out and thought he saw her climbing back over our wall, but he wasn't sure. However, she had her phone out and was apparently telling her ex-husband how we were filming her and 'why won't we leave her alone'.\n\nMy dad went out and she started shouting about how we always find ways to piss her off, we are all nuisances, etc. The trouble is, we are not noisy, we are not filming her and we really don't know what else to do. She has lived next to us for 18 years and nothing ever seems to be solved.\nTL;DR:"}

If this isn't the correct sub, please let me know which would be better.\n\nI'm planning on buying wheels and tires from the US. They are being shipped from California and I live in Toronto, Canada. I got the price + shipping for the address here in Canada. I'm waiting on the shipping estimate to Detroit. Depending on that, I'm going to make a decision and driving down to Detroit shouldn't be a problem.\n\nWhen the package gets shipped to me here in Canada, how much do I pay for customs/duties. Is there something I can refer to, depending on the price (with or without shipping) that tells me how much I will have to pay. Apparently the seller only charges sales tax if selling in California, would I have to pay tax if I'm getting them shipped here? (That question, I may have to ask the seller).\n\nIf I get the package shipped to Detroit, I will go there and get it. When I cross the border, how do I calculate how much duties I pay and if I pay tax and how much. I will be in the states for less than 24 hours.\nTL;DR:"}

We were both each other's first and only significant others (not counting the stupid week long relationships everyone has in 8th grade), and neither of us have had any romantic or sexual experiences with anyone else. She's a beautiful, smart, funny, and sweet girl, and she's really amazing, especially since we got to college (we go to the same school), since she's really come out of her shell.\n\nBut lately, like the past 6 months or so, I've started to feel...well, weird. I don't look forward to hanging out with her anymore. Instead of saying to myself \"Oh boy, I **get** to go hang out with Sally!\" (her name isn't Sally, by the way), I usually say \"Well, now I **have** to go hang out with Sally.\" I usually have a great time once I get there, but I never look forward to it before hand. It doesn't help that she's one of those girls who doesn't like silences much, so will keep talking no matter what, often retelling me the same stories over and over again, usually with an exact script.\n\nAnd, like I said, we've been together for four, almost five years. At our age, that's literally a quarter of our lives that we've spent with each other. I still think she's a great girl, but part of me says \"Hey, maybe your **real** soulmate is out there, and you're just not looking for her!\" But I feel like an asshole because she hasn't done anything to make me unhappy. \n\nI don't know.

My cousin and I were both 18, had just gotten into the idea of partying, and met these two gorgeous girls who had a lot more experience drinking than we did.  I drank a few times in high school, but I'd never been hammered before, so they pressured me into drinking way too much one night.  I ended up taking 13 shots in just around 15 minutes (confirmed by my sober brother), completely blacked the fuck out and ended up passing out on the buffet table (on top of the food).  The Deputy Cruise Director (2nd in charge on the ship) and another one of the employees took me and pretty much dragged me back to my room.  On the way down however we ran into my parents; I was completely unresponsive, but one of them said that I was just seasick and would be fine in the morning.  My parents still believe I was just seasick and still have no idea that I drink.\nTL;DR:"}

Now, for the first time, I am completely happy with who I am and am thoroughly enjoying living. I am now trying to find a relationship for the very first time. \nSince last October, I have been on many dates with nothing to come out of them. I am a very caring person, easy to get along with, and also quite attractive (I'm also a bit chubby, but hey). This shouldn't be so hard for me, yet it is. Multiple people have stopped responding to me, when everything went quite well on our dates and conversations. It's very troubling for me, as I know there's nothing wrong with me these days. Here's where it gets tricky.\n\nI am sexually open, so it's not like I push people away due to impotence or anything. But I have never loved anyone, and it hasn't been very long that I have actually begun to love myself. I don't know what it's like to have loved and lost, and I feel that this is the only major thing that sets me apart from most people.\n\nMy question: What is it, Reddit, that keeps people from caring about others? I genuinely like any good person (no narcissism, bigotry, etc.) who has a good head on their shoulders, but I feel like people are generally ambivalent towards me, while I'm trying to get to know them so I can care about them. It's just what I need in my life, the last thing keeping me from being fully happy. What haven't I experienced that makes me only feel connected to people that, like me, have been through hell and back? For the record, the only people I have as friends who I don't love are the types that don't place value on things, are carefree, and just roll with the punches. Everyone else seems to just have their head up their ass while not being terrible people. Explain life to me, Reddit, I want to enjoy it.\n\nP.S. - I realized I left gender out of this. I am a woman who mostly dates other women, but I sometimes date men as well.\nTL;DR:"}

On the other hand, my fiance lives in California and could move in with me and help out. I am also slightly concerned if my major is *exactly* the right one. I want to work on wildlife conservation.

I saw this as a good time to work on healing our relationship, however it became clear to me the best way for this work for me was for it to just be the two of us for a while.  After a couple months they started going to counseling and are working on their issues.  It came to the point where I asked her to decide which relationship was more important for her to save, ours of nearly 7 years or theirs of almost 2 years.\n\nKeep in mind that her other guy and I are now good friends, it's just that because of some of my past issues I need her to focus her energy exclusively on me.  At the same time she needs to focus a lot of her energy on their relationship.  Our options are split or make each other miserable.\n\nNeither of us wanted to, but we decided maybe it was best that we broke up to save our friendship.  I suggested instead that we meet in the middle and downgrade our relationship to have fewer expectations, obligations, and less time together.

I gave her my number, we chatted and met up a few times during her vacation. When she got back to the states we really hit it off and both mutually agreed we really fancied each other, we decided to try a long distance relationship. \n\nI absolutely love this girl, she's amazing. I can't imagine my life without her. She visited England again, except we spent the whole time together in my town and she stayed in my house. We had sex, she did have birth control but she forgot to take it once or twice because of the time difference and didn't notice. \n\nMy girlfriend told me a few days ago she was pregnant, the baby is mine, not that I suspected anything different. I don't know what to do. I would totally marry her but we've been together for 6 months. I want to take care of her and don't want to be some deadbeat dad but I'm not sure how when I'm in the UK. My dad died when I was 7 and it really impacted me, I want to be there for my child. \n\nI'm currently at a really nice uni and I want to finish my degree. I have 2 years left. I could try to move to the us to be with her but I don't even know how, I think you only can if you're married. I'm not sure about the UK either, and we both agreed it would be easier if she came to the UK if she was going to keep the child. I live with flatmates but I could move back home with my mum because she has a home with extra rooms, it's about an hour commute but I could deal. \n\nI support whatever decision she wants but she feels like she'll be ruining our lives if she keeps the child. I can tell she wants to, I don't mind I guess. I never wanted to be a dad at 20 but I'll do my best. If she got an abortion that would be okay too and honestly preferable. I'm not sure what to say but I'm trying to comfort her, she's been really depressed since she told me.\nTL;DR:"}

I wasn't sure what I was doing, so I continue on my merry old way, eating a ham sandwich. I guess whatever I was humming was nonsensically annoying, as around a minute later he comes and pushes me off the stool I was sitting on. As forementioned, I am an Aspie, and therefore I go straight to Hulk-mad levels of anger, this time mixed with fear. I lift the stool up in front of me to protect myself when I guess I accidentally hit him on the head. He made a groany noise, but nonetheless carried on. After ~5 minutes of him beating on me, an adult hears the commotion and comes in and breaks it up. I'm still really mad, as is he. After a while, I do my equivalent of calming down, which is a meltdown (oh god what have i done is he okay oh no oh no). The next day, we come back into school. When I say we, I mean I. He is off today, with a bump to the head. OH NO. Here's where the payoff comes. Before this incident, we weren't friends. Afterwards, we had a laugh and a milkshake about it, and we became best friends. That's also how I discovered my Aspergers.\nTL;DR:"}

The last time that we had sex was 3 months ago after we were both drunk and I thought it was a good idea to finish inside of her.  I wasn't really worried at the time because she was on birth control and I did it once before and nothing came of it.  I was forced to break up with her a few weeks later because she really liked one of my friends from high school and wanted to try and date him (They had been talking for the past year and a half and she has always liked him but never got over him like I tried to get her too).  Anyway I was really upset and we rarely talked for the next two months.  I was finally feeling over her when I get the text one day where she tells me that I may be a father.  I wasn't convinced because I knew she had taken a pregnancy test that came back negative before and I knew that she and my old friend had had sex. Well it turns out that she is 3 months pregnant and theres probably a 99% chance that I'm the father. She had begged for me to get back together even before she knew she was pregnant but I told her no. She tried again once she found out she was but I ended up getting pretty mad and telling her that she needed to have an abortion.  I apologized a few days later and wanted to try and work something out but now she wants nothing to do with me. I have no idea what I should do.  We're both currently sophomores in college and do not want a baby right now, and I really don't want anything to do with her anymore.  I would love to just say okay and let her handle everything but I don't think I can do that with a clean conscious.  Do I wait until she comes to me for help? Do I try and talk to her? Do I let her do what she wants and not worry about it? Any advice is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Real Cinderella shit.  Her dad will grumble and make a fuss about picking her up from work, because it causes him to miss his favorite T.V shows that he's PVRing.

The thing was, she made me sign it on the spot, not letting me refuse. My parents did not sign the contract, only I did.\n\n* Now, since school is starting soon, I decided to reread the student handbook.

We had a fight about it, and I convinced her that I didn't cheat.\n\nNow she wants me to stop talking to one of my best friends (one who is also my ex, no feeling for her anymore). The other girl has been one of my best friends since we were 7, so of course I refused, and she freaked out about it. She says she isn't going down that road again, but I can't just give up my best friend, can I? \n\nI really care about this girl, and I'm honestly sure that I love her (she doesn't know that yet, I can't tell her because its all too much for me) but its exhausting and infuriating that she doesn't trust me. She's done plenty that would make a guy suspicious, and I just trust that she wouldn't do that to me. Then I do nothing, as far as I can tell, and she pulls a fit.\n\nWhat should I do Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (19M) overheard my mother (F61) talking and crying to her dead boyfriend.\nPOST: So in the last year or so, my mother got back into the dating world after being separated for a long time from my father. She found this amazing, kind man named Frank. Although they were very different, they really fell in love in a short time. \n\nFor all of their relationship I was actually away at college and only got to hear about frank. They were deeply in love and had so many plans. Then out of the blue, Frank died. He quickly developed cancer in his throat and was diagnosed and dead in a week.\n\nFrank was an older man (in his 70s) but this was still a shock. And because of nasty issues with his children my mother never even got to say goodbye. Going home for the funeral was one of the hardest things I've done, and watching my mother go up to his body and say goodbye felt like no sadness I have ever felt before. \n\nIt's been a few weeks since his funeral and I'm now home for the summer. The main reason I'm home is that my mom decided to sell her house. She's been working nonstop, nearly killing herself to get it ready. She already had one tiny breakdown and now last night I heard her crying and talking to Frank while going to bed. I think that maybe she's trying to cope with the grief by working herself so hard. I'm really worried for her and afraid to bring up last night as it will stress her out even more. She's just been working herself like crazy, and I've been doing all I can to help but the pace is quite daunting, and I'm worried she's going to collapse. I just don't really know how to handle her talking to Frank. I know she's grieving, but I don't know if I should bring it up to her or just let her do her own thing.\nTL;DR:"}

We met through some online dating service and we hit it off pretty well. Everything has been perfect so far. Although I have had another girlfriend before her but due to her reluctance to have sex till marriage, my current girlfriend was my first. I knew that she has had multiple (9 or 10) partners before me and although it disturbed me a little but I thought it was pretty normal (I guess) for a 25 year old and let it go. Last night she got a text from one guy she used to sleep with (not a boyfriend) asking her for a threesome which she laughed off to. I was pretty furious at his proposition to my girlfriend and she told me respond to him using her phone. I started typing and then I saw that she had done really weird stuff (sexually) with him and when I asked she said she was lonely and was willing to say anything he or plenty other guys wanted to her. Note that she does not have a very high sexual drive so it was not to just have sex. She kinda used sex to lure guys to be around her while they did all kind of weird stuff they wanted to do. I have been so disturbed by all this that it has literally made me sick since then. I really like her but her attitude towards sex and relationships just doesnt seem healthy to me. I know I am not supposed to be jealous about her past as it was before me but my problem is not that. I would be perfectly okay with whatever she did with someone she loved but here the sex was used as a tool to get close to douchebags (she admits she knew they were douchebags). I have no idea how to deal with this.\nTL;DR:"}

Long story short he was incredibly immature and borderline abusive, and I regret it because I was so unhappy the whole time and it took me four months to get the courage to break up with him. I didn't like the feeling of having a responsibility to do certain \"relationship-y\" things, didn't like the time it took away from doing other things (I'm in college and studying very hard), and didn't like the effort I needed to put into it.\n\nI met this guy (19) a month ago and we immediately hit it off. We started flirting and even went on a date, and we get along really well. We both knew we liked each other and we were in that stage of almost-exclusivity. Honestly I was pretty happy to stay there, but yesterday he asked \"Are you interested in a relationship\" just as I was leaving class. I didn't know what to say, and I handled it pretty poorly- I feel like such a bitch. I just said \"I haven't thought about it, can I tell you later?\" ...\n\nThe problem is I really like this guy but I just can't get over how much I disliked my last relationship. I don't want to mess this up. I don't want this to end with us not talking because I think even if I didn't want a relationship, he would be a really great friend. I just can't make up my mind on if I want to date or not. I feel like a horrible person for all that leading on and then I don't even know if I want to go further.

Once we arrived back to our hotel room, I realized I was approximately 14 stories high and throwing bouncy balls off a balcony sounded like a great idea.

In real life events that preceded  and follow a crime are generally of a local nature. In other words, if you see a crime being committed it usually happens right in front of you and you know immediately to call the police and they should be able to handle it from there. The crime happened, you saw it, and had no active role in it. \n\nWith the Internet however, things can spring up on you that muddy the waters, and I'd like your input. What follows is a hypothetical situation. \n\nJoe logs into his PC and starts browsing the Internet. He finds an interesting link on a reputable site that leads him to another site, that while it is not as well known, is still a safe site. Then he finds a link to an FTP site that is offering free access to upload and download files. Joe logs in, downloads some cute pictures of cats and maybe a movie or two. He notices a file called \"BBC wildlife documentary\". Upon downloading it, he realizes this is in no way a BBC production but something far worse, say Child Porn. He informs the FTP site owner who traces the IP to an Internet anonymizer network and immediately deletes the files and bans the IP and network.\n\nSo what should Joe do next? Since he didn't know what it was, and it was reported to the owner of the server, does his duty as a human being end, or should he call the police? \n\nI ask this as a moral or ethical question, not necessarily a legal one since laws change. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIn summation (\nTL;DR:"}

It was as if luck was looking at me and basically said \"Because fuck fallenwhiteknight, that's why!.\n\nI leapt onto the bench in the backyard and did a flip, however, her dad walked by and wasn't paying attention when I was doing it, and proceeded to walk into my line of the flip. Yes, I ended up clipping him with my foot. Now, a foot to the head is generally bad, but not too serious. However, you need to understand that luck loves to kick me in the balls. Her dad wasn't \"knocked out, but I'll get back up normally\" knocked out. He was \"Mike Tyson one punched someone's senile grandmother\" knocked out. We move the hangout from their house, to the ER, and I apologized the whole way. I don't think my chances of getting a \"son-in-law of the year\" trophy is going to be very high in the future.\nTL;DR:"}

In a way I'm relieved. I don't have to overanalyze the fact he still has his \"in a relationship\" up. I don't have to double think about whether he'll see my posts and try to find a way to secretly communicate that I've changed. This is just another step in realizing that it is HIM that needed changing. \n\nThe last straw was when I saw he became a fan of a page full of gorgeous half naked girls working out. Me, a perfectly fine pretty girl who WORKS at a gym.This, the guy I would literally beg for sex from. Who would go weeks and weeks without sleeping with me and yet continued to look at porn and masturbate. Who wouldn't hold my hand. Who stopped sticking up for me. Who wouldn't even kiss me for no reason other than me asking him to. Who watched me cry and lay awake at night wondering why I wasn't good enough. Who would promise to change and ultimately did nothing. Who got more excited over his possessions than he ever did about me. \n\nI've never had two such strong emotions co-exist. Longing for him and searing hate at the same time. \n\nWarning, immature heat-of-the-moment rant ahead: I honestly hope you don't find anyone. In fact, I know you won't.\nTL;DR:"}

I'll start from the beginning.\n\nThe relationship between her and I in the past few weeks/months have been fantastic. Enjoying the time together, going to movies, lunch/dinner, sleepovers, etc. In the past I've had pretty rocky relationships, including getting cheated on, and not feeling like I'm wanted. So some insecurities unfortunately fall into place because of that, which makes me sometimes ask \"are you mad at me?\" or something along those lines. When I ask her those things, in the past she'd console me and assure me everything was fine between us. But recently she's become pretty annoyed for hearing these questions, and it's getting to a point where she's actually questioning our relationship because of it. This was last night when she told me about her being upset.\n\nThen, she went on to go on quite a list of things that I do that now annoy her. One specifically, I didn't even realize but I not my fingernails in her car and didn't put the nails out of the window. I didn't do it on purpose, but she went on a rant because of it. Before I know she would have shrugged it off, but now it's just upsetting her.\n\nI don't really know what to do, we've been together since April (I know quite a short time) but we were good friends before that for over two years. She came out to me as having feelings, if that makes a difference. I would go as far as saying that I love this girl, and the last thing I'd want to do is to let her go.

What are some of the most ignorant lapses in knowledge you have witnessed?\nPOST: I am an aspiring math teacher and our graduate program requires all education graduate students to take a content reading class. I walked into class the other day, couldn't find a seat quickly, so sat next to an older lady in the class, I'd say about 50 years old. I talk to her a little, since there was some downtime, and learn that her content area is Social Studies.\n\nA while into class our teacher starts reading us a short story, to demonstrate how reading aloud can get the students' attention. The story is about a girl whose mother saved her from the Holocaust by throwing her off of a train as they were taking them away. After the story was over, she told us to talk to our neighbor to see what we got out of the story. \n\nAt this point, it just seemed like a meaningless exercise, but then the future social studies teacher said, \"It sounded like her mother was saving her from slavery or something.\"\n\nNow, inside my head I figured that she was just confused and misheard the story, so I responded with, \"Well, no, she was saving her from the Holocaust.\"\n\nAnd then she said it. The words that you never expect a grown, assumedly educated person to say: \"Well, what is the Holocaust? Is it a religion or something?\"\n\nI sat there in stunned silence. I couldn't believe that she had gotten this far into becoming a teacher without knowing what the Holocaust was. There's just no way. I eventually responded with, \"It was the murdering of 6 million jews in World War II.\"\n\nHer response? \"Oh. Yeah, yeah.\"\n\nAs if it wasn't a big deal. Seriously.

We had a sister parish in Santiago, Chile and I was lucky enough to be able to tag along with them to visit the country.  It was about a 8 hour flight to get there and I had to poop hardcore the entire way.  I am 6'7\", 260lbs and I really don't like pooping in toilets that aren't private due to the sheer size and velocity that they tend to expunge from my rectum.  \n\nWe were going to stay at the Episcopalian Bishop of Chile's house in Santiago, who happened to have an extremely hot daughter, and of course only one bathroom in the house.  When I arrived I had to use the restroom extremely badly due to the long flight.  So I went upstairs to their restroom and let loose.  Mind you, I had never used a bathroom outside of the US or Canada, so I was unaware of their underpoweredness.  Needless to say, I opened pandora's box when I flushed.  Sultry poo water went everywhere. I did my best to clean it for about 20 minutes or so, failing miserably because I had no idea where the plunger or cleaning supplies were.  \n\nEventually, I had to go downstairs and admit what had just occurred in their one and only bathroom.  The most difficult part was that the only person who was fluent in both English and Spanish was their hot daughter.  So she had to help me through the whole ordeal.  \n\nMoral of the story, don't let a girl see your poo strewn all over her bathroom floor before you try to woo her.

He's expressed regret about ending things during the few times we've talked (contact has been cut off for a while at this point), but has continued to pursue the other woman, but at this point re-conciliating the relationship would be impossible due to the nature of the way he broke things off.\n\nEver since he left, I've found myself getting more depressed.

We are currently 8 hours apart as she got an almost full ride scholarship to the school she is at. We met over last summer and decided to try the long distance deal because she's amazing and great and I love her and our relationship has been really going well these last 8 months.

At the start of our relationship I told her that was the plan and she thought it was cool. Lately she has been talking more about the future and our future together and what we're going to do when I graduate while she's still in school. She has been talking to her academic advisers about options for schools in my home state to transfer to and her adviser suggested instead of leaving her school, that I could move to a city closer to her until she graduates to keep things going. I shot that idea down almost immediately and I could tell she was kind of upset by it but understood why as well.\n\nIs it unreasonable of me to not want to give up the plans I've had since starting college for a relationship that has only been going on less than a year. We love each other and I can absolutely see a future with her and would be willing to wait a little while but 4-5 years for just her undergrad not to mention any additional schooling beyond that. If I do go back home I don't know what that means for our relationship to be honest and I know she's worried about that, as am I but I guess to a lesser extent.\nTL;DR:"}

Most of times we have hung out, it has been with other people present, but he'll often bring up a story to me specifically and always laughs at my jokes, etc. We occasionally walk with each other and are alone, and sometimes it is kind of awkward, but I'm not sure if he is nervous or just ran out of things to talk about. He also snapchats/texts me every once in a while. \n\nI also know that guys will find a reason to touch/brush against someone they are interested in, which I have noticed has happened a couple of times just within the last few days.\n\nAll my friends are telling me I should go for it, and while this is all fine and dandy, I just can't tell if he also has a crush on me, or if he is just being a friendly/nice person.\n\nIt has been a while since I've had a boyfriend, so I could be reading these things wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

We met on the holidays so we spent pretty much everyday together. \n\nAfter spending a little time together though, I found that I sorta fell out of liking her. I just can't see a future. I myself am a very quiet, self-organised and introverted person; I need time alone for emotional/mental/physical recovery - though she just always wants to spend time with me and it's exhausting. \n\nI've found that I just don't enjoy spending time with her anymore; she gets so emotional when I can't hangout and the more time I spend with her, the more I realise I can't be with her - but she really likes me. I don't really know what I'm doing posting here - I've never had a girlfriend before and I just don't know how to end it - is there any advice? I feel like such a dick, but I figure it's best it ends before she gets even more attatched. Has anyone had a similar situation? How did you deal with it? Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

Last year was the beginning of my college career. I moved into a dorm and made friends with a bunch of people on my floor. We hung out all the time last year and it really felt pretty great to have made so many friends so quickly. \n\nI didn't really talk to them over the summer that much, but I did contact them at the start of the school year asking them all if they wanted to hang out. I only got a response from one guy out of about ten, and I hung out with him (Tom) for a few months after still. I think the last time I hung out with him was in December.\n\nI think I'm mostly just wondering if I did something wrong. I've tried to contact some of them multiple times and I've never gotten any response. Even Tom has stopped talking to me. I know they still hang out together because I've seen pictures of them posted hanging out together every few months or so. I feel really weird about this because I'm not sure what I did to provoke this, and a big part of me is wondering if they ever actually liked me or if I was just being a nuisance hanging around them when they didn't want me to.\nTL;DR:"}

He's really good to me, sweet, we get along really really well. Many things fit really perfectly with us in ways I didn't really think they would(opposites attracting, etc). There's absolutely nothing malicious about him at all.\n\nThe issue is, he's been seeking help for depression and because of that and his medications, we haven't has sex since April. Before that, it had been very intermittent for a few months. At first it was a sudden plummet in sex drive but now we've been blaming it on the meds.\n\nWell, 4-5 different medications and 5 months later, it has not helped. We've had sex maybe twice in the past 7 months. His sex drive just doesn't exist. I keep saying \"we just need to find the right medication to get you feeling okay again\" but at this point I feel like I'm fooling myself. No matter how much we talk about it, nothing ever happens.\n\nThe other thing is he knows that I feel strongly for him (as in, I love him, otherwise I wouldn't be trying to go through this) and he has admitted he's \"not as attached\" to me as I am to him. I've been in this situation before and swore I would never do it again, but I keep making excused that he does like me, treats me well, and isn't anxious to go anywhere else.\n\nAm I just fooling myself? I kept hoping the right combination of meds and therapy would get him back to that dude I was with the first few months, who wanted to have sex all the time and was totally ready to say \"i love you\" but I think it might be a lost cause...\nTL;DR:"}

I'll give all the relevant details I can think of so that hopefully people might have some contextual advice for me.\n\nI have met a woman through a dating website and we went on our first date last night. I'm a male, in my 30s as is she. Had an amazing time, we spoke almost non-stop for two hours, then she had to go home as she was getting up early for work the next day (she had already warned me about this before we met). We didn't touch, other than a kiss on the cheek and a hug at both the beginning and the end; however, she was smiling the whole time, locked eyes with me, played with her hair, had open body language etc. I said I'd love to do it again, and she said me too. When I got home I sent her a text saying how much I'd enjoyed it and that we should grab a bite to eat next week. She replied saying how much she had enjoyed it too, and that I should definitely touch base next week.\n\nSo, I know that I am prone to being nervous about stuffing things up at this early stage (I become much more confident after a few dates), and probably overthink things a lot. I don't want to play any games by artificially waiting before texting, or give her the idea that I'm not that interested, but I also don't want to come on too strong. The reason I am unsure is that I've seen a lot of advice saying that you should just forget about it and text when you have something to say. However, I know that she is super busy, working six days a week, and she told me how after work today she was driving down the coast.\n\nGiven this context, and the fact she said \"touch base next week\", do you think I should wait until Monday before texting again to set up the second date? Or am I just totally overthinking it all?\nTL;DR:"}

The blanket reached my neck and, as she keeps pulling the blanket down, she says \"It's time to wake up!\" I grabbed the blanket frantically and thought quickly to myself what I could say to stop her from exposing my naked body to her and the rest of my classmates. \"Wait! I need to find my teddy bear!\" At that point, she let go of the blanket and smiled, saying \"Alright, you find it while I get the rest of your friends up.\" I have never gotten changed so fast in my entire life.\nTL;DR:"}

We started out as friends, kind of. I knew I liked her and I flirted a lot. I made it very evident and when we talked about her relationship she said it had been bad for a long time. Long story short that  ended and I started dating her. She was great for a while but then became very controlling. She wanted to know where I was all the time and who I was with. If I went out with friends I was accused of ignoring her and not caring. This was with other guys. If I met a girl in class or studied in a group that had girls in it she would accuse me of wanting to flirt with other girls. \n\nA year later she ended up going to another college for a better program. This was somewhat good because it gave me a little freedom without her being too far away. We have broken up briefly a couple of times. The problem with her is that whenever there is a disagreement, I am completely shut out. No calls, texts, or even responses to what I send. The longest period of time this has gone on has been 2 weeks. \n\nJump forward to present and we are still long distance. It has become a problem because she is always expecting me to be able to drop whatever I am doing and come visit. I ask her to come down and she says she cant because she is busy while simultaneously blaming me for being selfish and not wanting to come see her. I am also very busy. \n\nAnother thing weighing heavy on this is family problems. I will be vague but essentially we had very similar health problems with our siblings. So I feel like I need to stay in some way to support her through that. But I don't know if she will let me be her friend if we break up. \n\nThe problem I have is that I love her so much, but it is wearing me down to always be the one having to support, assure her of our relationship and compromise.

Hardly ever like, \"dinner then sex\" or \"let's have sex after we go grocery shopping.\" but lately we've seen our sex life getting boring, and like a chore. It's not as spontaneous and passionate as before because we're expecting it when the time comes because we don't always get the opportunity, and when it presents itself, we take it.

Even though I feel this way, I'm pretty good at hiding it and most people don't consider me to have those traits. I've liked plenty of girls throughout high school and college but could never muster the courage to ask any of them out. My current girlfriend started working with me about 6 months ago. I was crushing on her pretty much immediately. I figured I didn't have a chance with her and sorta moved on with my life without giving her much thought. Around 3 months ago she started giving me some pretty obvious signals that she was interested in me and basically made it as easy as possible to ask her out. \n\nSo now we've been going out for a little over 2 months and things are going great. I really like being around her and I can tell that she has a good time when we go out. For the first couple of weeks that we were going out I felt like I was on top of the world. I gained a huge confidence boost from the whole situation. I couldn't believe that someone as cool and pretty as she is was actually interested in me.\n\nBut recently I've been having mixed feelings. Sometimes when I'm not around her I'll feel like I'm in over my head or that I'm not ready to handle something like this. Sometimes I wish that I'd never asked her out.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: 22M - After last relationship, I have no interest in actually trying again\nPOST: My first relationship ended 5 years ago. It was short, but intense. Afterwards, we weren't intelligent enough to sever contact completely. She felt pity; I wanted her back. What resulted was 3 years of mutual psychological and emotional torture, which I'd rather not get into as it might identify me. At some point, I blocked her and didn't look back. I've slowly been getting myself back and have been quite successful so far in life by most standards - I have a job I love while living abroad, no longer have to work paycheck-to-paycheck, etc.\n\nHowever, I can't bring myself to approach women at all. My brain processes attractive women like pieces of art; to be appreciated and admired, but never touched. Half of me thinks this is the negative self-view I received after those three years (somehow I would stain that art and make it less than what it is), and another half thinks it's almost entirely vulnerability and trust issues.\n\nEven with these things identified, I'm not sure how to go about fixing them. I'm not interested in one-night stands or short relationships at all, which is the advice I hear most about \"recovering.\"\n\nI've had multiple chances for one-night stands or short-term relationships, and as soon as it becomes a real possibility, I let it slide by and ignore it (much to the dismay of my drinking buddies). I don't want to go there again.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

We went on a history tour more than a sight-seeing one, so we went to WWII battle sites an the like.\n      The best part was when we went to the costal, walled, city of St. Malo. Since my other compadre was a bit stuck up I had to befriend the two other tour groups we were paired with, which included a pretty \"indie\" girl. I fell into a summer love with her and we started walking with each other on each of our tour stops. When we got to St. Malo we were told we could roam for the next two days and that the town people were receptive of foreigners. The morning we got there me and the girl, let's call her Lindsey, and her two friends set to the streets and started the best day of my life. The city itself was amazing, the walls surrounded the whole city and the parts where it faced the sea were especially beautiful. The best part of it was that there were absolutely no cares. I didn't have to worry about being mugged/harassed and there were a bevy of street performers, one of which was the best musician I've ever seen. Albert Niland was his name, look him up on YouTube as im on my phone and it's a pain to link, and my group stood to watch him as he sat in the middle of a town square on his mini amp playing his acoustic guitar and singing his heart out.

The people who help us are volunteers and we become friends with them. I met my new girlfriend, who I will call Sally, at the beginning of the semester. We slowly started talking more and more and went on our first date about 3 weeks ago. We've hung out before that and have gone on about 5 dates total.\n\nLast night we ended up making out in my bed. The night before her roommates had told me that I should make our relationship official because she really liked me. So I asked her if she wanted to and she enthusiastically said yes.\n\n**Mental backstory:**\n\nI have a moderate anxiety/depression issue. The depression used to be a lot worse, but it still gives me problems. Sometimes I question if Sally really likes me or if I even like her. I know she likes me, and I can't see myself liking anyone else, but the depression still causes me to have problems like that. And I still have those days that are just very depressing and melancholy. With the anxiety, things are still tough and sometimes I have panic attacks that cause my muscles to lock up and breathing is hard and the usual. Those aren't very common.\n\n**Where I am now:**\n\nI have never been in a relationship before, and so I don't know if I should tell her. I don't want to appear \"weak\" to her as I generally act pretty confident. I also want to be able to work through these disorders on my own. I don't know if I should tell her as a preemptive move, or should I just tell her if I need her during a depressive episode or panic attack? I'm not sure if this is information that should be shared when beginning a relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been in the same class and school district for the past 4 or 5 years, and as badly as I want to ask her out and get to know her, I haven't.\n\nAside from the classic jitters of asking a pretty girl out and my own inexperience, I am concerned I might not be able to handle a relationship.\n\nMost notably, she and I exist in pretty separate social circles. I'm friendly with her in-school social circle, but I don't hang out with them personally. I'm worried that if I want to spend a moderate amount of time with her, I will have to spend too much time away from my current friends, who are near and dear to me. I don't want to neglect them.\n\nAlso, Junior year is pretty rough and I don't know if I could manage my time correctly with a girlfriend before second semester came around, so I could reorganize myself. Should I wait in this case? I've been guilty in the past of crushing way to hard on a girl I've never dated (although I'd describe past events as infatuation - this is different).\n\nFinally, the only thing I can think of is to ask her out to coffee or a movie or something so I can talk to her and get to know her.

So essentially, when we're not together, we don't talk. We do see each other 5/7 days a week though.\n\n**MY QUESTION:**\n\nShould I bring this up to him? \n\nIf I do, my fear is that I'll come off as a needy, overly attached girlfriend that's insecure and thirsty for attention.

I moved to a cheaper city, to be closer to my friends, and started dating a guy I've known for years. We've always wanted to date, but distance has always been an issue. He wants to buy me everything I look at, and I don't know what to do. If I say no, he insists. He hasn't really bought anything out of ordinary, or anything all that expensive, but I've never had anyone buy me *everything* and not let me pay for *anything*.\n\nI'm not really prepared to have a sugar daddy. I do enjoy being doted on, sure, but I'm not sure if he thinks he has to buy my affection or if he's just being sweet. I've brought it up once (\"You really don't have to buy me all this stuff, you've gotten the last # of meals/drinks/food/etc, let me get this\"), but he brushes it off. I never say rude things or complain when he pays for things and buy me stuff, I feel I'm respectful in that sense... but I'm really afraid that I won't be able to express interest in something without him thinking he needs to buy it for me. That isn't what I'm about, I'm much more of a minimalist when it comes to material stuff. He's really well off financially, and I recently lost my job so he uses that as grounds to spend money that I don't have. It's just... on stuff I don't really need, but he insists. I do have money saved up, but he bullies his way into paying for everything. I've bought one thing on my own since we've been out (we go out fairly regularly, typically whenever we hang out ~4/5 times a week)... that thing was a bone for my dog.\nTL;DR:"}

She's actually pretty cute.

She can't let go and refuses to, even though it's obvious to the people around her that she needs to separate herself from this jackass. He likes getting rides and meals and *attention* from her. He is a narcissist.\n\nI have been patient, loving, trying to bring her closer to being okay with letting go of Jack and moving on, but she continues to abandon plans with me and others to go spend time with this man that has absolutely NO interest in her whatsoever.\n\nAbout 6 months ago Jack told me he uses her for her car, and she makes him feel good about himself.

I've caught her looking at me on a few occasions and it's noticeable because I sit diagonally behind her. In other words, she's got to make an effort to look in my direction.\n\n I wanted to give it a little bit more time before I made my 'move' and I think today was the day that set it in stone. When class started, the professor asked us to take out our homework assignment and I made a joking comment saying something like 'Oh no, we're not turning it in already, are we?' and the said girl laughed at my comment. Nobody else did! \n\nLater on, we formed groups in class to collaborate on the assignment (she was not in my group). Shortly after the groups split up she asked me and another student how we did. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think she was asking just me but in an indirect way. Kind of like a social innuendo saying \"hey, talk to me!\". See? I would like to add that both of these situations are the only social exchange we've had this semester.\n\nSo that's where I am. I think I should strike while the situation is 'hot'. So, what advise can you give? Would it be totally awkward to just go up to her and ask her on a date? It's not something I've done before, but it may work out. In the past I've befriended women in my classes and it never panned out beyond friendship, which is fine. I'd like to make this a little bit different.\n\nA little bit of added information is that this girl looks VERY familiar. I think she went to my high school, but was a grade or two ahead of me. I'm not 100% sure, but she looks familiar. Could that be a possible conversation starter? My heart pumps every time I think about starting a conversation with her. It's totally silly, because I usually have no problem talking to strangers! I call this a crush.\nTL;DR:"}

I have never made more than her. I get unemployment. She is very controlling and when she does not get her way she goes in to guilt mode. \nExample: I guess I will do my laundry since you haven't done it because you are so busy all day with doing nothing. \n\nI know I slept untill 10 am then worked for 6-10 hours with three 1 hour breaks at home, but I am tired and just want to be left alone to watch my shows. You will take care of the kids and make sure they dont bother me after you bring me dinner. \n\nYes this is after me cleaning the entire house (because she has stopped all cleaning I must do this everyday) as I am taking care of my 3 year old all day. I care for the kids from 7 am till 9-11 pm and never get a break or lunch period and my wife thinks this is more akin to a vacation than having a 55-80 hour a week job.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest\nTITLE: I quit drugs today. Enough was enough.\nPOST: For the past 6 months I've been mentally addicted to a generic form of adderall. I had a steady supply of 30 tablets each month (not prescribed to me), and would finish the 30-day supply each month within the first 10 days I got my hands on it. After those 10 days I spent the next week mentally and physically drained from lack of sleep and food. Then I'd start counting down the days for my next supply to come in.\n\nI hid this addiction from every person in my life, including my wife. Although no one knew my secret, I'm certain they noticed a negative change in my behavior and personality. This substance was fun when I was on it, and I was often very productive. But I couldn't moderate my use of it and would always end up popping another, even when I knew it'd keep me up all night, only to turn me into a zombie the next day.\n\nI began my newest supply a few days ago. When coming down from a binge last night I had a realization. I started recognzing all of the negative impacts these tiny tablets were having on my life, and how they were not only hurting me, but were also hurting my amazing wife who had no idea of the demon I was battling. I recalled last summer when I flushed my last bag of weed down the toilet after experiencing a strikingly similar realization. I have not smoked weed in over a year now, nor have I missed it. So last night, as you may have guessed, I said \"enough is enough.\" I opened up the pill bottle and proudly flushed the remaining 12 tablets down the toilet! I instantly felt a HUGE weight lifted off my shoulders, as I was no longer a prisoner. I was free. As of this morning I couldn't be happier with my decision, and I feel confident that I'll never touch that stuff again. To anyone battling any type of addiction, make TODAY the day that \"enough is enough.\"\nTL;DR:"}

The only thing I can think of is that she isn't extremely skinny, but I like her the way that she is.\nAnyways, I'm just running out of ways to try and boost her self-esteem.  I'm just looking for some creative things to try, or some tips from people who have been in similar situations.  She's just a very shy and stubborn girl who is very wonderful to me, I just want her to feel better about herself more often.\nTL;DR:"}

I just want to make a decision and have that be final. I'll be transferring to a four year and so its really crucial that I make a decision.\n\n To start off, we're long distance. Our communication is terrible and it has lead to many problems. For some reason she takes pride in her terrible communication, but I don't doubt that she loves me, but at this point in time it just isn't good enough. I need to know exactly what the situation is if not it just isn't going to work.\n\nSecondly, she has been unsupportive in literally every aspect of my life, and somehow she feels its justified. I mean I get that she must have reasons to be upset, if she's so upset beyond repair why is she still in this relationship? And to be honest its just such a drag that shes acts like a counter force for every minor and major thing. And she feels that its justified because of the way she feels, but it really it isn't and she needs to get over it. And its not like once and a while she gets upset and he expects me to apologize which would be totally fair, but she's in this permanent state of being upset without any practical solution. Like she's literally mad at me for being me and then doesn't want to end it and guilt trips me for trying to end it.\n\nAnd you're probably thinking why we'd ever be together in the first place. And the explanation is that we've had a long history, and its not so easy to just end it, because we'd be throwing off a major component of our lives, and so it is a decision that needs to be taken seriously. Whatever the conclusion that is made I just want it to be at a state of certainty. I'm tired of being forced to have one foot in one side and another foot on the other. Any suggestions on what to do? I've spent years hoping that this relationship would pan out, compromising a lot of my life just to get bullshit in return and it no longer seems worth it anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

Despite our little problem, we have a wonderful relationship and I truly love him. I have had happy, healthy, sexual relationships with a a few people so naturally I want the same with him. The problems are almost entirely on his end (can't get aroused, just all around not interested), and I am an attractive girl and I have tried *everything.* So I was innocently opening up a document on the preview program on his computer and I accidentally closed\n it, so I went to re-open it and see tons of porn pictures in his recent files. I was just *innocently* curious (I watch porn too, but it's not something we really share together) and I see it's hundreds of screenshots from pregnant women cam sites. And then dozens of folders of different sessions. He has no cookie cutter porn... Just pregnant women. \n\nI do a little more not-so-innocent snooping because he has never shared this fetish with me and the amount of pictures is shocking. I look through his email and find he has been spending $200/month to visit these pregnant cam sites, whereas I spend $0 on porn. It's not a necessity I file into my monthly expenses. He is a very frugal person, so this shows me that it's important to him. So important that he can't \"get off\" with free porn, but needs contact with an actual pregnant woman in real time. \n\nAll of our sexual problems suddenly make sense, but I'm scared to talk with him about this. I was snooping around and found something I shouldn't have. But we need to talk about this, because excessive porn consumption seems to be leaving him completely and utterly disinterested in me. Not only that, but it's an outrageous cost to pay $1200 a year just to get off. How do I approach him? What does this mean about possibly \"fixing\" our sex lives?

I understand that people are fed up with the wars too (although I think the drone program deserves the least amount of criticism of all military programs that exist...), but small actions like this will discredit the entire movement. Unless the OWS movement stays focused to its original goal of financial equality it will splinter into 100 different groups advocating everything from LGBT equality to legalizing pot.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Saving to go back to college\nPOST: Hey guys, just wanted some advice here. \n\nI graduated college last year, majoring in psychology and am now working at a tech company making 52k a year (3k/month). I'm interested in going back to school at some point in the (near) future, possibly 3-4 years. \n\nI have a good job, and the pay is good and I'm learning a lot about tech, but I'd rather be in a developer position. They don't offer college reimbursement, and besides, I wouldn't have time to go during the day since this is a full time job. \n\nBasically, it seems to me that I would have to quit the job at some point in the future, and go back to school based on the money I've saved up, sustaining myself with a part-time job. I have about 10k in the bank, just paid 7k yesterday to my highest interest loan (6.5%), so now I only have a loan total of about 15k, which my parents will pay and have me pay them back, rather than let the interest accrue. \n\nI know this isn't a lot of detail on monthly expenses and what-not (i'm living at home at the moment, but plan on moving closer to my job in the coming months). College tuition at UMD, the nearest school is roughly 10k a year, so I would need at least 20k or so to get 2 years, but I don't doubt I would need money on the side for emergencies/rent (parents charge rent). I also have a mutual fund that has about 21k in it that I could possibly use to fund the college funds if needed, but I'd rather not touch that \n\nBasically what I'm asking is, what would you guys do in my situation? How much should I save up roughly? I don't understand how so many people go back to college as they get older, especially with full time jobs. Do they quit their job and work part-time with a lot of money saved up to sustain themselves? If any more specifics are needed, I can provide that. I would probably be making around 1.5-2k/month after I move out after expenses.\nTL;DR:"}

I got myself down to around 175 pounds back when I was 16 but put it all back on the past two years due to depression, and I'm having a real hard time doing this. I have an illness which is weight related (iih, but no one seems to have ever heard of it) that I used to be in remission from until around a year ago which is depressing in itself. On top of that, I can't eat properly either. I was always a picky eater as a kid and you know everyone always says you'll grow out of it, but I just didn't? I have around 30 foods I can eat, and never together. I won't touch a single vegetable (I can eat fruit though! Saving grace haha) and all of my meals rely heavily on carbs. I'm scared of not liking the taste of the new food and then gagging as a result and it makes it hard as fuck to try anything, and believe me I know how pathetic it sounds I just can't shake it. Add in some pretty bad anxiety (mainly around my body) and you've got me, basically.\n\nAnyway what I really mean to say is that I feel like the odds are completely stacked against me and losing weight is just something that can never ever happen for me. It can happen for others sure, but not me because I'm abnormal in some way and can't behave like everyone else? I mean yeah I've got 16 pounds from January, but I've been stalling since like March (which to be fair is 99% down to exam stress comfort eating but still) and it's really hard to not get down about this. I don't know how to get over my food issues. I don't want people to tell me I have to get over them first because I can't be like this any longer, it's emotionally draining and it makes me absolutely loathe myself.\n\nWow I didn't mean this to be so depressing hahaha I'm sorry, I just want reassurance I think. I don't even know if these types of thread are discouraged and I'm sorry if they are!\n\nanyway\nTL;DR:"}

A small apartment fire happened within our rental unit. Our lease has a clause stating that if a fire damages  the premises such that our \"enjoyment is substantially impaired\" that we could terminate the lease without penalty.\n\nThe apartment management company said that they do not think our enjoyment has been infringed upon, and will not honor our breaking of lease. They have threatened to send us to a debt collection agency, who I assume will take us to court over ~$2000 (the fee for breaking lease early)\n\nWith all of that said, do I even stand a chance against a company in small claims court? Will the company really come after us over 2000 dollars? How will this whole ordeal impact our credit scores and ability to attain a mortgage?\nTL;DR:"}

The day before I had learned that she is a religious person, which I respect in her and I think it is what makes her such a patient and mature person. But I was worried it might effect things long-term. So after I make the rejected advance, I asked her what her position was on the whole sex thing. Really dumb mistake as we are only two weeks into the relationship and thanks to that question we've now already had our first serious conversation. It didn't go terribly but it was a strange conversation with a lot of pauses. She ultimately settled on the notion that she should perhaps open up a bit more. Then once things cooled down a bit and we started getting back into the rhythm of the date. \n\nBut I again I made another advance. I honestly don't know why. That's not who I am.

Also, my dad was trying to explain to me that you can't believe everything you see and that there isn't always truth in advertising/photos. Being a photographer for the past 35 years, he explained how almost every photo you find is shopped and has only a layer of truth to it. \n\nI was really angry with this and sent a long email to the photographer asking about the details of the shot, and anything that could uphold it's authenticity. He replied with a detailed message about everything used in the photo, how it was taken, how he edited it, etc. \n\nThe next day I showed the e-mail to my dad as well as footage I found of the trick. I felt all high and mighty winning this argument. My dad only looked down disappointed and said \"I guess you're right\". \n\nI felt like a total asshole. My sister explained to me that he was really bummed because he is a photographer and I made him look dumb. Even though I was right it made him upset. My dad is really awesome and always nice, so beating him in an argument really made me feel bad.\nTL;DR:"}

Will this be awkward someday?\nPOST: [Crossposted from AskReddit because I constantly forget that subreddit is for more general questions, not personal problem stuff]\n\nI live in New York City (albeit Staten Island, but regardless). I've never been to Central Park, been on the Brooklyn Bridge, been to the Statue of Liberty, ridden public transportation anywhere in the city (though I have in London and DC), been to the Empire State Building, been to pretty much any of the museums there. I live in Staten Island and I've never been on the Staten Island Ferry. I've never, as far as I know, been to Coney Island. I went to the Bronx Zoo once when I was much younger, but since I have no recollection of that time I've for all intents and purposes never been there.\n\nI'm 16, but I'll be heading off to college in about a year and two months. The reason I've not seen much of this city is part overprotective parent and part I really dislike what I've seen of New York, especially Manhattan (for various reasons I don't feel like elaborating on).\n\nMy concern though, is this: I'll go off to college in Boston or DC or Philly and as I make friends at whatever school I go to, they'll ask where I'm from. I'll tell them New York, and they'll ask me what it's like, what these NY landmarks are like, and I'll have no damn idea and end up looking like a fool.\n\nAre my concerns here reasonable? If you met someone from whatever city, and they didn't know the slightest thing about it, would you be a little thrown off? What can I do to not look like a fool if that sort of conversation comes up?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm finding myself less and less attracted to her and more and more interested in other people (I've never cheated or even considered the notion.)\n\nShe's an amazing person, though she can drive my crazy at times.  I think the major reason for this decision is my need to have more experiences.  I'm still young and she's the only person I've ever dated for more than a month or two.  I've gone through my parents divorce, years of counseling, a diagnosis of depression during our relationship and she's stuck by and supported me.  I've done the same for her through two major surgeries and similar family crises.  \n\nWe've been an incredible couple, but I think I need something else now - including space.  She can't handle being away from me for very long, doesn't like to go out by herself and will try to get me to come with her.  That wouldn't be too much of a problem if she didn't want to go out every day.\n\nWe just graduated, starting entry-level jobs in our fields soon.  She's talking apartments (we've lived together before, including an apartment in college) and I'm thinking breakups.\nTL;DR:"}

He's mature, level headed and respectful - I see myself marrying him with no questions asked. \n\nHowever, when we fight, he ends up really turning the attention to himself. For example, in the past I have been upset about something which has caused me to feel a bit anxious. I turn, he will get incredibly upset feeling like he failed me, and that he's let me down when he hasn't. It was maybe just an overreaction on my end. Even when I state that, he'll still be upset for awhile feeling like he should be better?\n\nToday him and I were chatting via the internet and I asked him a question, he didn't answer, so I asked again. Turns out he was watching a video, and just didn't tell me, so I was talking to myself for a few minutes. No biggie, I wasn't upset. SO took this really hard feeling like he'd let me down. Something he said regarding the video didn't add up, so his response was \"No, I'm not lying!\" I agreed, but stated something he had said didn't click and his response was \"I'm just a terrible person, is that what you want me to say?\" \n\nI admittedly, and pretty immaturely, hung up the call after saying 'I'm not dealing with this.' He knows that's not what I meant. I just wanted clarification. He sent me a few messages after apologizing and saying he deserves punishment, but that's not what I meant! \n\nAgain, this is his first real relationship and he's suffered from major self esteem issues. If this was someone else, I'd say they were being manipulative. My SO is perfect besides this ONE small issue. How can I address this/understand it?\nTL;DR:"}

I met this girl and we were just acquaintances throughout high school. Last summer I got texting and we started texting one another. The first time we literally texted each other three days straight, but now we really don't text that much.\n\nRELATIONSHIP:\nOur friendship so far has consisted of texting, and we met once this winter. She wants me to visit her at her college though (or her visit me) in the spring. Most of our conversations are light, although she did tell me about a recent breakup she went through. I'm not sure I can take these \"serious convos\" as an indication as she likes me, because she's very talkative. I'm sure I'm not the only person she turns to for advice. She knows I care about her, so she might suspect that I have feelings for her. I'm pretty sure she does not reciprocate my feelings for her.\n\nSITUATION:\nI feel really conflicted about my feelings for her. First off, I'm really confused what I want out from her. To be honest, I'm not sure if I actually want a relationship with her. She is talented, smart, and pretty, but at times she could be artificial. Furthermore, I'm sure that she does not see me as a potential boyfriend, even though she seems to care for me as a friend.\n\nI feel like if I continue our friendship, I'll be bound to damage both of us later on (through jealousy and the like). I'll also look pretty pathetic hanging onto a friendship hoping it'll turn out to be a relationship. I feel like breaking off our friendship is the best alternative, but I feel too emotionally invested to break anything off. Sometimes I tell myself that I'll get over her sooner than later, but I'm not sure if that will be possible now. Also, I really don't know how to break off our friendship without offending her.\nTL;DR:"}

Not to mention that there is an airfield nearby with planes coming in/out constantly. \n\nThis isn't an issue for me (I will get used to it), but my cat is very stressed out. In the past he would hide under my bed inside my room, but in this case all I have is a mattress and a curtain. I couldn't find him this morning but found out that he hiding in a very small space behind the stove. I was concerned about this hiding spot so I filled it up with some cardboard to prevent him from going there. I placed a cardboard box sideways in my room with a blanket to cover the entrance hoping he would use that instead. Right now as I am writing this he is hiding behind the curtain that goes to the balcony in my space. \n\nAt the moment he is eating very little, I am not sure if he is drinking, and he just seems extremely unhappy. I've only been here for a day, and I know it needs time, but will he be able to adapt to his new environment? He is generally comfortable around me but is very skittish around other people without a lot of exposure, so being in this new/noisy environment only exacerbates that. Preferably I would like to have my own room but as I said budget constraints make that difficult at the moment. \n\nAny advice/help would be appreciated, am I too worried?\nTL;DR:"}

I understand that, but I can't change it till my membership is up.\n* Most of my friends there are guys - but that's just the nature of the sport. There's simply more guys than girls around (I do have girl friends though).

He hurt his leg recently, so he barely goes to the gym - and when he does, it's just light swimming. Plus, I can't afford two memberships and I really like climbing, which his doesn't have. His company pays his membership so he can't switch gyms - but he can't rockclimb right now anyway.\n* Climbing is dangerous. I mean, it is, but it's also very fun.

Never mind the reason why because it's a complicated story (isn't it always?). It wasn't infidelity or anything - in short, we both agreed we best stayed friends (we knew each other as friends for years before we started dating), but then I really started missing her and apparently she missed me. I might expand on the break-up in the comments, but for now I want to keep the focus on this:\n\nWhenever I send her a text, it usually takes hours before she responds, sometimes days, sometimes she never replies. Now, she's always been like this with texting - all her friends complain about it, but lately it's been worse than usual (than in our first relationship).\n\nI'm always the one initiating the text conversations, the phone calls, and the dates. It's starting to feel very one-sided. She makes me feel \"needy\" even though we don't text all that often (on average maybe 3 texts/day). I \"constantly\" think about her and why she's doing this. I don't think she's cheating on me (if she is, then it's not sexually - she has issues with sexuality due to vaginismus). My biggest fear is that she's doing this on purpose, to stay in control of the relationship. It's working and I hate it to the point that I want to give up.\n\nWhen I ask her about it, she always has an explanation. She's always busy with something. I understand this: she is under a lot of work stress, she's taking evening classes, she has her apartment and family to deal with, etc... Most likely, this explains why she's very frugal with her time. Still, I'm a busy person as well, but I make time for her. I feel like If she would really love me, she would do the same. But perhaps I feel like I'm needy because I am and I should probably be a bit more patient.\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this would be very much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I was taking 12 credits and I work 3rd shift full time. Now I thought I could handle both but I learned that I couldn't the hard way. I started off strong and determined to keep up with homework but as the semester went on sleep became more important. So I fell be hide in my classes specially English..\n\nBy the end of this semester I dropped one course and decided on a new major. Other than that it didn't change that I was missing two papers and all the other homework in English. Barely passing my other class I decided English was a lost hope and I focused on the other one. I grinded and got most of the work done ended up getting a B. I had perfect attendance in English I just never did the work and never talked to the teacher. I had given up hope. I was okay with taking a B and an F I deserved it for being so stupid. \n\nBut when I saw that grades were posted and that she had given me an \"A\" I literally refreshed and reopened up my transcript maybe 15 times. Couldn't even believe it I even made it on the Dean's list because I had an A and also a B making my GPA 3.5. I was super happy at first then when I talked to my friends also in the same class they got B's and C's I kind of felt bad. They did the work when I didn't. I couldn't even bring myself to talk about it. As far as they know I did all the work and it was fantastic. I don't want to tell my parents either or anyone else for that matter because they are happy for me and they would be disappointed otherwise. I don't usually post on reddit but I needed to rant and get this off my chest so thank you. \n\nBtw. Have you guys ever been this lucky or have been through something similar?

She has a tendency to bottle things up and shut conversation down.

So in short, I get more upset and she gets more closed off and so it leaves both of us feeling like the other party didn't hear them. \n\nWe have talked about working on this pattern since we both recognize that it isn't the best way to approach disagreements, I want to be respectful of her need to consider her thoughts before speaking, and she wants to be respectful of my desire to resolve arguments as quickly as possible.\n\nSo I open up the floor to you fine folks: what techniques might you suggest for a couple to utilize whenever a disagreement or an argument arises?\nTL;DR:"}

My children (daughter 3yrs, and son 11mo) usually wake up early, but there are times when they don't wake up early enough to spend time with their mom. Even if they are up early enough, the time they get to spend with my wife is not quality time as she is frantically getting everything ready to leave on time. Sometimes at night, the 11 month old will be asleep by the time my wife gets home. Long story short, the kids don't get to see their mom on the regular like they see me.   \n\n  \n  \n  The decreased time spent with their mom has created some separation issues for my children.

I added in the \"mmm watcha say\" audio clip (from Imogen Heap's \"Hide and Seek\") when Tybalt stabbed Mercutio (I recreated Act 3 Scene 1, if anyone cares). This was before YouTube was cracking down on copyright infringement. When they did start cracking down, I noticed that any copyright infringement was resolved either by YouTube automatically crediting the song artist and linking the iTunes download link (which they did with a separate video of mine), or they would completely remove the entire audio from the entire video (which they did with my Romeo and Juliet video).\n\nI think it's kind of ridiculous because they took the audio away from my 6 1/2 minute video over less than two seconds of a song. I feel like it wasn't even true infringement because it was alluding to a popular cultural reference at the time, but then again I've never been very informed about copyright laws.\n\nRight now I'm more concerned about getting my audio back just so I can download it because I edited the video on my old family computer and we reformatted the hard drive before YouTube took down the audio. I'm not concerned about views or w/e, I just want my audio :(\n\nDo you know how I can go about resolving the copyright issue?

Leaving to study abroad in four months, terrified to invest in relationship for fear of losing it.\nPOST: Hey, reddit. \n\nTonight my irrational fears seem like a bit much to handle on my own, so I was hoping you could give me some advice. \n\nHere goes: I've met a sweet, great guy, who I dated exclusively for about a month in spring before he left for a summer internship for two months, during which time we dated other people while constantly texting and calling one another. He's just returned from that internship and we'll go to school together for the next four months, and plan to date exclusively, until I leave to study abroad for six months.  \n\nSo here's the crux of it: I feel scared to have this relationship knowing it could definitely end because of distance. I feel that if I don't have it, I could be missing out on a great guy and a great chance to learn and grow, but on the other hand I could avoid so much pain. \n\nWe've done distance before, but the relationship was so new and the time period was so short that it didn't feel like an accurate reflection of what it would be like to do six months of separation after a four month relationship. I'm essentially afraid that I'll lose this great guy to circumstances beyond my control, resulting in terrible sadness.\nTL;DR:"}

But for whatever reason, she doesn't make my heart race. Sometimes I feel bored with her and crave a deeper, more intense, more dramatic relationship. My ex-girlfriend may have been a nightmare, but I never wanted to be away from her for more than a second. In contrast, I was relieved when my girlfriend said that I could only stay over at her house until Saturday this weekend - we don't have the kinds of conversations I like to have, and our sexual inclinations are completely mismatched. She always wants to \"make out\" and get handsy, no matter where we are, even if I explicitly say that I'm tired and don't want to participate. \n\nI guess I know the logical move is to break up, but I care enough about her that this isn't easy for me to even think. I know she's looking far ahead for our relationship's future and often makes jokes about us getting married or having kids some day. \n\nI know she's a great option for me. She's adventurous, sexually open, supportive, and can never get enough of me. She lost her virginity to me, too. \n\nI do love her and just typing this out makes me feel terrible. But honestly, I don't know what to do - I'll end up cheating or breaking her heart or maybe, just maybe, things will improve and I'll feel better with the passage of time. I like this girl a lot, but I never felt the \"spark\" as I have in the past. \n\nI don't want to break her heart or make her feel terrible when she's done nothing wrong and is such a wonderful partner. What should I do? \n\nI don't know if I'm fucking up in some other way. I've been depressed lately and having other problems; one of my friends passed away about when we started dating, and I've been destructive ever since.\nTL;DR:"}

J started seeing a girl, E (24), around May. I knew E when we were 18. I was in my first serious relationship with D, and E was part of our social group. Me and D had problems and he cheated on me with E and ended up dating her for about three years. \n\nI told J about my history with E. When he first met her he agreed that she was crazy. She's one of those loud, opinionated girls, and has basically no friends because she's not a likable person. J started sleeping with her anyway. They went on holiday in September (which she paid for), which I thought was crazy as they'd only been together a few months. But, whatever, everyone moves at different speeds. \n\nNow: E doesn't get on with J's friends but he brings her out every night anyway. Then they end up fighting. She even fought with him at his 21st birthday party. It's now at the point where he spends most of the week in her house and all weekend with her. Does anyone have experience with this kind of situation? I'm obviously not going to interfere in their relationship, I just want advice from anyone who's had this problem. All his friends have noticed this problem, it's not just me being clingy or anything. If she was a nice girl I'd understand him wanting to spend all his time with her, but she's awful and has no friends for a reason.\nTL;DR:"}

She says she's over them, and I'm not so sure.\nPOST: I'm a somewhat-frequent poster, but this is a throwaway account just in case.\n\nI've been friends with said girl for a couple of years now. We met in college, and, being older and more experienced in my field (we were both students at a fine arts school in the bay area) than she is, we've had what I've always thought was a really healthy, fun, and pretty intense friend/mentor relationship. We've spent quite a bit of time together. She's been dating the same person since before I met her (I'm not sure when they started, but it was before I'd met either of them), and I've been in a couple of relationships (I just broke off a major relationship with someone else a few weeks ago, actually) throughout the time we've known one another.

She swears she's worked through it with him and gotten over her feelings for me and that things are working better between the two of them.\n\nMy main concerns is that she still has romantic feelings for me and that it could cause problems, and that my continuing to be friends with her could create issues with her relationship and possibly future relationships. My gut tells me that she probably hasn't totally worked through her feelings, partly because I've been in a few similar situations in the past regarding infatuations with individuals where it's taken me time to work through my feelings, and sometimes those feelings can crop up later on in unexpected and sometimes troubling ways.\n\nSo, I put it to you, Reddit: How worried should I be?

I wish to spend more quality time with him outside of seeing each other when we get home, yet he seems to want more time to do things with his friends, play video games, and have alone time to 'regenerate'. Cool, I get that. However, between my job (I work 8am-9pm, 5 days a week) and his job (40+ hours) & he is in school about 10 hours a week too, we can't seem to find common ground between managing all of the things we want to do whether it is together or apart. Naturally, I crave attention and wish to be a part of the party. He is reserved & opportunistic so when his friends invite him out for a beer, he just assumes to go with them without inviting me along or even the simple, 'Hey hun, grabbbing a beer with the boys. Be home around 12.' I often feel like he is hiding something from me and can't wrap my head around why he can't have fun with me there too. Is it because he assumes that when he comes home that that should be enough time spent together? Even when we go out to eat or grab drinks, we have fun but it's more casual and he just seems bored with me i.e. we have little to talk about, our interests aren't as intriguing as they used to be.\nTL;DR:"}

Not really on a daily basis but when it triggers, it is pretty insane.\n\nShe gets pissy over the most simple things. She got lost one time in a train station and she blamed me (called my mom a whore). But I let that go because we were just months old back then and I thought that she was just stressed. \n\nThen as the relationship progressed, so did her temper. She gets quite mad when I correct her (calling me \"perfect\" and \"too intelligent\" but she was just being anti-intellectual). She gets angry when I am not talkative (she is very talkative and I'm the opposite). She got furious about my theory regarding something political we were talking about. She even got mad at me because I was not a registered voter.\n\nI told her about her temper many times now. She always told me that it is a \"normal\" part of a relationship, and that I will never ever understand because I am a person who does not get mad very easily. But sometimes I lose my patience whenever she gets mad over small things. Something I never did before. \n\nShe is a nice girl when her anger does not strike. Loyal, sweet, caring. But when it does... She just can't control herself. Not just on me though, it seems that she's getting furious over a lot of other things in her life.

This is my first summer at home from college in the new house, so I'm not familiar with people going door to door because we lived all the way out in bumfuck nowhere and if someone came to our door it was important.\n\nAnyways I open the door to see these two smiling old ladies on my doorstep. Before I can see what they're holding in their hands, my Cockapoo starts barking insanely loud right behind me and I instinctively exclaim \"JESUS ZIGGY CALM DOWN.\"\n\nI then bring my attention to the women, and what they were holding, which turned out to be this: \n\nExcept I noticed the older of the two was shaking very noticeably, and as she proceeded to give me the whole spiel about Jesus and the big event they have going on, her shaking gets worse. She starts stammering and the other woman puts her arm around her. \n\nRealizing that I have fucked up, I start being very cordial and say thank you several times (probably too many times). By the time she finishes she can barely support herself and is carried away by the other woman who looks back and gives me the nastiest stank eye I've seen from an elderly woman. \n\nI'm so going to hell.\nTL;DR:"}

The times I decided to retaliate, we'd both get reprimanded. However, if I didn't retaliate, this guy (that I shall call Charles) got off scot-free. He wasn't just mean, he was an asshole. After a few months, I finally decide to leave the guild. Nothing catastrophic happened, but I felt I was better suited going somewhere I was more welcome.\n\nI moved to a new server and I was happily raiding with a new guild. During this time, I found out my former guild was about to announce a move to my current server. There were raiders in my former guild that I didn't like because they had been more than exceptionally rude to me. They had gossiped about me, cursed at me, bullied me, and more without retaliation but the worst was \"Charles\". Charles had a character name that he had had for 7 years in WoW and he was known for overreacting. I saw my opportunity. I reserved his character name on my server. Then, I leveled the character up before he even knew about the server transfer. \n\n**Revenge:** One day, a friend from my former guild told me about Charles complaining in their VoIP program about \"whatever asshole took his name\". Charles was drunk and behaving belligerently. I jumped at the opportunity. I logged his character's name and whispered him in game, \"If you weren't such a @#$! mongler, you might have your name right now. If you want it back you can (fill in something Charles used to tell me to do)\". He went into a rage. He asked for my home address from my friends in the guild and threatened...many things in his drunken stupor. The guild master told him that I might be a @#$!, but he picked that fight with me and, consequently, deserved it. *I still have his character name.\nTL;DR:"}

In college, we were pretty close and as most high school/college relationships go as you get older, we don't see each other very often, probably once or twice a year.  When we do see each other, it's a good time and very friendly.  I consider Hasan a pretty good friend.\n\nI've known for a while that he was getting married and recently got the invitation in the mail, where I found out the event was going to last four days.  After doing some research, I realized that this was not unusual for traditional Indian weddings.\n\nMy job is flexible and I can take the extra two days off from work with some notice.  I can technically attend all four days quite easily, it's still a bit of a nuisance to spend that much time for a wedding.  I wouldn't have to pay for air fare/hotel, as I could commute each day(45 minutes each way).  I asked Hasan how many days he wanted to attend and his response was \"All four\".\n\nI'm a bit conflicted here, I do consider him a pretty good friend but taking four days for a wedding seems like a bit much.  When asking him how many days he expected me to attend, I really thought he'd say \"at least one or two\".\n\nIs he asking for too much here?  He is probably only going to get married once and is putting the time and effort in to host a four day event, so maybe I should just suck it up and go?\nTL;DR:"}

She is lonely because her sugar daddy broke up with her for the 3rd time & is looking for him to come running again. Two days later I am assuming that happened as he didn't return my texts the entire night.  The following day I asked him what he did the night before & he lied to me but I didn't call him on it.  I have stopped texting and emailing him & haven't gotten in contact nor has he.

The drama all went down during our final year exams, so instead of dealing with it then I decided to wait until after my  exam finished. The 'waiting period' however didn't go to plan and we still messaged each other and briefly saw each other during study breaks. After exams we ended up officially getting back together.

I don't know why I do it to myself because it brings up feelings of annoyance and anger with HER, not him, even though it was him betraying me not her (I didn't/don't know her personally, apart from in regards to this). I thought time would help me get over it, but it hasn't and I'm honestly questioning whether I'll ever be able to let this fully go!

Do I even proceed, and if so how?\nPOST: [Previous reading.](\n\n**New developments:**\n\n* Sunday I took this girl out to dinner, and then a hookah bar after. We had a great time. I initiated contact, had my arm around her, holding hands, etc. After the hookah bar we just drove around for a couple hours talking about various interests and singing along to bands. It was a good time, enough so that I asked her out for a second date and she accepted.\n* Yesterday we went and walked around this city/old town sort of place, grabbed dinner again, and pretty much just enjoyed each other's company for around ~4 hours. She talked about how in past relationships she's been cheated on and manipulated by various others. I tried to empathize with her, but considering that she was my first real dating experience since my freshman year of high school I couldn't really add much from personal experience. When the night ended I kissed her, and she kissed me. \n* This morning she texted me that she couldn't really do a relationship right now and that she was sorry. I told her I was sorry if I did anything wrong, but that I appreciated her being upfront about it.\n\nNow, I really like this girl. We have a lot in common and seemed to hit it off really well. Is there absolutely anything I could/should do to let her know this? I obviously do not date much and always have personal defenses up, but I let them down for her and now I feel like everything was all for not. \n\nAny and all advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Then I turned to snooping and discovered he was having secret meetups with them and lying to my face each time. And more recently I was using his laptop to print something and on his tabs page he saved 2 adult chat rooms. He also has a folder of saved pictures of random girls. When I brought this up he denied it and told me I was crazy.\n\nSo since then I've been checking every day and noticed he always deletes his browser history. And to top it off I looked through his facebook and saw he was messaging the same internet girl from 2 years ago about the same old shit.\n\nNeedless to say I want to break up with him but it won't be easy because we live together for a few more months.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Is this a ridiculous deal breaker for my [20F] 3 year relationship with my LD boyfriend? [23M]\nPOST: For the basic back story, my boyfriend and I started dating a year before we went long distance because I decided to go to college further north. He got a discount to go to university in our home town, so we agreed that long distance was the best option. So we have been long distance for a total of two years. These two years have been plagued by the single problem of communication. He hates technology to the point that he probably wouldn't have Internet if he didn't need it for school, so he obviously doesn't have a web cam or a phone with face time capability, leaving talking on the phone or texting as our only real communication options. \n\nOver these two years we have had multiple fights over him never calling or, when he does call, only wanting to stay on the phone for a few minutes. The culmination of these fights is that he wants me to text him and remind him and to tell him when I want to talk longer. This seems like a fine compromise, but now he treats talking to me like an immense chore. He rushes conversations, starts talking to other people, or makes up excuses about why he doesn't want to stay on the phone. He says that he just hates talking on the phone because \"it isn't personal\" or \"It's uncomfortable to carry it around against my head\"  but if I suggest him buying a Web cam, he will agree but never get around to doing it. \n\nAfter two years of this, it just makes me feel like I have no priority and that I'm not interesting enough to want to talk to. But every time I go home for breaks things go amazingly with no communication problems and this makes me so confused as to whether I should make a problem we only have when I'm gone a deal breaker. \n\nSo my question is, should I just give up the nagging and wait it out until I get home from school, or is this a problem big enough to bring a break up over?\nTL;DR:"}

The breakup was mainly due to a timing, she moved away about 2 hours to college and started drifting away and we sort of just fell apart. After that, we had about 3 months of NC before talking again, and realized we still had feelings but were trying to move on with new people and stopped talking again.\n\nSince then its been at least half a year since I texted her, and I have seen her maybe once in that time at a mutual friends party, where I said hi and talked for maybe 2 minutes tops. \n\nI am kind of considering texting her or contacting her in some way, but am not sure if I want to try again with her. It isn't that I have not gotten over her, I have dated several girls since we broke up and honestly had not really thought of her in months.

I've tried bringing this up but it again leads to an argument, which will be my fault, because she views it as me trying to dodge blame for the pain and stress I cause her\nTL;DR:"}

We're in finals week now, and I'm only going to see her one more time before the month long winter break.  I have no idea how to proceed.  It's not really the rejection that I'm worried about, but more that if I ask her right before the final that could just be stress and a distraction for both of us.  Especially since we are going to be sitting directly across from each other at a lab bench.  I can't wait until after the final, because we definitely won't finish at the same time.

I want to reduce this amount as much as possible and currently work as many hours as I can, but as you can imagine it's incredibly difficult to balance ivy league academics, the networking needed for career development, extracurricular leadership activities, and a part-time job. The money I currently make goes to sustaining myself with rent, food, textbooks, etc.\n\nI've seen posts from other redditors who have become webcam models on websites like Myfreecams and Chaturbate and say that the pay is GREAT. Definitely much higher than my $8/hour work study job. \n\nHere's my issue though- I plan to go into banking, which is incredibly conservative and reputation-based. If a company or hiring manager found out about me being a cam girl, my career would be absolutely done. I feel confident in my ability to conceal my visual identity. If I follow through with this I'll get a wig, maybe fake piercing, and wear makeup in such a way to disguise my facial features. **My main concern is whether or not my webcam modeling activity would ever show up on a company background check.** \n\nFor me to work on these sites, they would require my social security number, and I would pay taxes on whatever I earn. So the IRS would definitely have a record of my business with a webcam modeling website. Is this information accessible to standard company background checks? Is there a way to make sure companies wouldn't be able to find that information?

She currently has a boyfriend. He's cool with her and I being so close and hanging out by ourselves, he respects and trusts us both. He does not however know about my feelings and does not know she wants to get an apartment with me. I'm conflicted by this because I'd prefer she be open and honest with her boyfriend (even though I have feelings for her I want nothing but the best for her relationship, she deserves that happiness and he gives it to her) but at the same time if he knew he would probably be upset and feel uncomfortable with how close my friend and I are.\nSo, my I guess my question is this: In your opinion or experience, how do you think this would play out in my part? Obviously you don't know us well enough to know but I suppose you can have an idea.\nAlso, should I encourage her to tell her boyfriend? This is kind of a big deal and \"I want to move in with the guy who has feelings for me.\" seems like it might cause some issues for them.

If I were to move out, she says that she would have to move back home, which is in a different state, because she could not support herself on her income alone. All her friends are either staying in their apartments with no available rooms or moving across the country, and she absolutely does not want to look for roommates on Craigslist. \n\nI feel very guilty.

Two were \"reach schools\" that I didn't stand a chance getting into and obviously got denied. The third school, West Virginia, I got accepted. \n\nNow, WVU is a good school, but it had a very negative stigma around it being for inbreds and people that only want to party. I do want to party but not like that's a deciding factor where I want to go. I personally believe I CAN do better than wvu, but I'm sure I'd fit in there. \n\nSo if your unfamiliar with community colleges, basically if I get good grades, my high school record gets erased and colleges see I'm a 4.0 college student and can more than likely get accepted to very good schools. \n\nSo what I'm getting at is my brother graduated from college 2 years ago and is in the navy and living in San Diego. He Is moving to a big house on the beach with a roommate and really REALLY wants me to move to San Diego and go to community college and live with him and then transfer to a good school next year. \n\nIn case you've never been to San Diego, it's beautiful. Literally perfect. The weather girls food everything. \n\nSo is missing out on the 'freshman experience' worth potentially going to a good school in a year. I really feel like I'll be missing out on a great year of my life. \n\nAlso money isn't an issue. Well kind of it is. My parents are giving me one semester and if I fuck up I have to pay them back (wvu would be 14k, Community would be 2.5k)\n\nI'd also have to work a little next year just to have money to pay for stuff like going out to dinner if that makes sense.\nTL;DR:"}

I am really over snooping and how it makes me feel but I almost feel like I am unable to stop, or addicted to it!  \nI can go for days or weeks, but I always end up checking my fiance's phone, email, or something to see if i can find anything.  I've never been given a real reason not to trust him, and am pretty aware this is MY own issue.  I am not sketchy on my side either,and would be happy to show my fiance my whole phone and any text convo.  So I just don't get why I am unable to stop 'looking' for problems.\nHas anyone else had success in stopping snoooping in full?  I feel like it's almost an addicition.  I will go a while and then check it when he leaves a room and I will almost feel a high after.  I know I would HATE it if he did the same and I realize how wrong it is etc. \nI am more curious if anyone else was like me and how they stopped themselves?\nTL;DR:"}

We met in college and have been friends for about 7 years. We live in different cities now so we have to play a lot of phone tag and talk online a lot. She's recently started seeing a guy friend of mine, and they are super into each other. The only problem is all she wants to do is talk about him. I'm so happy they got together and I don't mind talking about him a little, but she will call, text, or message me several times a day to just talk at me about this guy. I'm the only mutual friend of hers and his that she trusts, so I get that she thinks she can only talk to me about him. But I'm so bored with the conversation and have lost all patience with talking about him. It's gotten to the point where I dread her contacting me and have been avoiding her messages, since I know she just wants to talk about this guy. On top of that I'm unemployed and dealing with a lot of my own issues/depression in my own life, and she's lately been using 'checking' up on me as a way to sneak in more conversation about him. I can't even describe how hard it is to stomach these conversations when I'm dealing with deep emotional pain and she is acting fake concerned so she can talk about a guy I've heard about a million times. How do I tell her to she needs to give me a break, but like in a polite way? Or do I just need to be direct about this? I've kind of backed off on answering her message or calls right away, but I'm worried she's going to think I'm pulling back from the friendship, not the conversation topic.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [19F] with my boyfriend [19M] of 1.5 years, he is addicted to marijuana HELP\nPOST: Hi Reddit. I have been with my boyfriend for almost 1 and a half years, and I've known since the beginning that he smokes (since the age of 14). I just want to clarify that I have nothing against pot at all, I smoke occasionally as well, but because my environment isn't people that smoke regularly; his friends however, smoke very regularly.\n\nI love him very much, but as I have learned (in school, so I know it may be biased), it apparently has a correlation with schizophrenia.. and I'm scared to death for him because he also meets other criteria like schizophrenia in the family, young use of weed, childhood trauma, stress, etc. \n\nMany times he said he would stop and that he took this seriously, but with no effect. For a few months already, we agreed that he would smoke for a maximum of twice a month, and I also asked him to tell me when he smoked so we could keep track together. My concern is not so much about the schizophrenia (conflicting info everywhere), but the fact that he can't do it, he can't contain himself to twice a month even though we agreed it was a reasonable amount. He is dependent to it and it angers me because sometimes he doesn't tell me because he's afraid of disappointing me and when he does I get kind of pissed because I don't know what to do, I just feel like I'm the only one that finds it important (the fact that he is dependent to it and can't keep his word to smoking twice a month). \n\nIn March, he has already smoked 4 times (he just texted me that he smoked with a friend). I'm going to see him later and we'll talk about it, but I seriously don't know what to tell him anymore. I don't know if I should keep trying to help him and how to react if he smokes more than he's supposed to.\nTL;DR:"}

I had just fed the puppy and she was finishing up her food as I plopped down onto the couch. I was laying facing towards the couch when I felt the burn and the pressure building, the compilation of smelly foods that I had devoured an hour ago was already sending it's own \"kaiju\" in the Pacific rim sense, toward the portal to our world in my nether regions.\nUpon releasing my flatulence, I could tell it was a particularly foul smelling concoction as it literally burned when it passed through the poop shoot canal. I had not realized my dog had come over to see what the loud crack of noise was and decided on saying hello to me while she was there.\nI rolled over to see the final seconds of a face of complete and utter terror. I burst out laughing hilariously while  apologizing to her but she was frozen in place. I don't think anything could have ever prepared her for what she just had experienced.\nShe eventually started to walk away and I rolled back over to rest and then I heard her retch.

The only problem is, they are a young couple with two children aged 3 and 8 months, who just bought a house and don't have much money. I am basically working 40+ hours for only $150 a week...which is absolutely nothing. With those rates, I barely make rent and rely on my parents to help with gas money (and with the commute, it adds up). \nNow, here's my issue. I have been offered a job with another awesome family (also about 20 minutes away) who are willing to pay me $400 a WEEK. I really need that money to start paying of student loans and also just to have money in the bank for a change. This family would need me to start after the first of the year. \n\nSo, parents of reddit, my question is: How do you recommend telling a great family I can no longer work for them?\nTL;DR:"}

Her, she has summer classes, on top of working as well and she is 100% occupied from like 6am-6pm. She will come over after that sometimes and she will be tired but not talking all day just makes me feel pushed to the side because she has other stuff going on too.

The snap was of him naked in front of a mirror, and the caption said \"Yes I will!\" I can't help but think that she's responding to them in an inappropriate manner as well, mostly because of his caption. She took her finger off of the screen very quickly (I'm assuming most of you know how snapchat works). I don't know how to feel. It's happened before with another guy, but I'm not sure how far that went. When I mentioned to her that he could go to jail for it, she said \"and thats why you need to keep it between us.\" I'm obviously angry, this has been a couple days ago but I haven't spoken to her much about it since. I told her I believed her when she said she wasn't sending him things like that, but I really don't think I do, because he's third on her list of most snapchatted people.

Some brands of bottled water don't cause this, I make sure I drink those.\nWater drunk mixed with coffee and/or milk doesn't seem to cause the same sensation, I presume that this is because the water's chemicals become saturated and don't interact with the surface of the tongue the same way.\n\nI've been to various doctors around Europe a while ago, but nobody has yet managed to find out what it is.

Never receiving a final bill from Verizon to submit to T-mobile, she quickly forgot about it. She's moved a couple times since them, and it wasn't until her father received a phone call from a collections company (he wasn't on the account) that she was reminded of this.\n\nShe called the collections company back immediately, specifically didn't acknowledge the debt, and stated that she will contact Verizon directly to see if there was ever any debt (to never contact her father again). Collections offered to settle, but she said she wants to speak to Verizon first anyways because it sounds like a scam. We checked her Credit Karma, [and it showed the bill marked as collections] but in the summary Credit Karma [doesn't say any accounts are in collections] Is it even really in collections? Her credit score is 540, but that could be because she's has a credit history of <9 months and like 3 accounts.\n\nAnyways, after calling Verizon, Verizon said that she could pay her bill and they would send her a statement acknowledging that everything has been paid in full. They also said it would take 30 days or less to reflect on her credit score.\n\nWho should she pay? If the debt has already been sold, then would paying Verizon anything help?

Went through all the denial, depression, questioning etc and came out of it. Now, I don't like her as much as I used to. I've come to accept, more or less, that nothing between is going to happen. But sometimes I still have a hard time seeing her flirt with other guys etc.\n\nI don't want to be like that. I want to see her as a friend, and be happy for her when she finds a guy she likes.

She said she, at some point during the week, wanted to go to a park her mom liked and have picnic there. I haven't said yes yet but I want to. \n\nHere's in lies the problem: her and I used to be pretty close, nothing romantic but if it had continued, maybe, somewhere down the road it may have been. Since my SO and I have been together I haven't really spoken to her all that much. I still consider her my friend. \n\nMy SO has had their heart broken too many times my too many people in their life and fears that when the two of us are together we will fall into each others arms and rekindle the relationship that we didn't have. \n\nIs doesn't help that I kept some letters my friend wrote me a few years ago until relatively recently.\n\nShe is really uncomfortable with just the two of us going (btw I dont know if its just us or not), which I understand. BUT this isn't just her randomly calling me up and wanting to go somewhere. Her mom just died and I'm trying to get her mind off of it. She's my friend. \n\nSo how do I go about doing this without anyone getting hurt?\nTL;DR:"}

Neither of us is really into broadcasting our relationship, so we just kinda added each other out of \"eh\", not because we wanted to interact online.\n\nAnyway, my curiosity got the better of me and I perused his page one night and saw a ton of messages and pictures of him with his ex. They broke up over a year ago and haven't spoken in over a year because she cheated on him, and none of the posts are recent. It bothers me that he didn't take them down, but Facebook isn't important to him so I assume he just didn't bother. It's just the content that bugged me more anyway. For one, he posted tons of comments about how she's the most beautiful/sexiest/gorgeous girl he's ever seen. He's never said anything like that to me, so I kind of ribbed on him like \"I think you traded down!\", to which he replied \"It's okay\" and once he realized how bad that sounded he followed up with \"I don't compare you\".\n\nThere were also \"I love you\" postings very early into their relationship, where as I'm 4 months in and I occasionally hear \"You're cute, I like you\" from him.

He's absolutely amazing and I'm honestly starting to  think he may be the love of my life.\n\nI have been in serious relationships before, including a boy with whom I moved out to live with. That relationship was psychologically abusive and ended 8 months after moving in, after he emotionally cheated on me and had a sexual skype affair. Needless to say, I am absolutely spoiled by my current man :)\n\nMy current issue is with myself. I have an obsession with the idea of starting a family. My SO and I have discussed it casually a few times, and have openly communicated what we desire in terms of the possible timeline of our relationship. He says he doesn't mind, but I can't help but feel like I'm putting unnecessary pressure on him, even though  a possible engagement and all is still quite a few years away.\n\nTo put a few things in perspective, I'm a second year undergrad, living on my own and entirely financially responsible for myself. My SO currently lives with family, but spends every night over. We are taking things casually, and communicating about everything. Not only are we dating, but we have a beautiful friendship as well. We are just different enough to complement each others personalities. My obsession with family stems from my cultural background as well as my very complicated and mosaic family situation. All the steps I am currently taking are all in the goal of giving all I can to my children. If I cannot achieve a stable employment situation and marital situation, I simply and sadly would not have children.\n\nI'd like to hear some advice from both men and women about my current situation, as well as some rational reasons to mute this behavior.\nTL;DR:"}

We've earned our keep.\nThe FU happens when just the other day, we decide to hit the place up again. We're eating as always, made small talk with the waitress and the owner like we usually do. Blah blah. Now my ladyfriend is a pretty loud eater, something her family and I tease her about all the time. She's good humored and likes to laugh as much as I do so as she takes a drink of water I made an exaggerated slurping sound which got the surprised laugh that I expected. I could see her trying not to spit her water out, I laugh, she laughs again and dribbles what little water she had on the table. Unbeknownst to me, she had inhaled a bit of the water and the next thing I see is her throw up on the floor/table. I sat there in shock throwing her napkins and rubbing her back in horror while my poor girlfriend suffers the result of gagging on a drink of water because of my stupid ass. As if that isn't bad enough, this whole scene played itself out at the exact moment that the waitress was bringing back the bill.

She insisted aggressivly that we do something else, so I did what ever to keep her happy.\n\nNow this may all song great. But theres a problem. She has a boyfriend. He lives in California (we're on the other side of the country) And hes coming to visit this weekend.

He has a really bad stutter and has difficulty speaking in general. I know I seem shallow, but that might honestly be a deal breaker.\n\nI find it really difficult to have a conversation with him. It'll take him 15 minutes to explain a simple concept that should take no more than 30 seconds. When he doesn't know exactly what he's going to say before he says it, he'll use all the wrong words (to the point where the sentence makes no sense) and I'm left trying to decipher it. Things rarely extend beyond a 1-3 word answer in our \"conversations\", because he is fine with those. \n\nThis isn't because he is unintelligent by any means; he is far smarter than me. He has a PhD and has published several items. His writing is phenomenal. Whenever we IM or text it's like he's a totally different person. He's quick, eloquent, and explains his position extremely well (it's pretty clear that it is something he has practiced - probably to aid in writing for those that don't understand his field at a high level).\n\nI guess I'm just getting really frustrated at it all.

He still takes her on walks during the day and gives her loving attention. But he tells me everyday that his life is not improved with a dog and that he is depressed with her around.\n\nI'm torn. I love my husband, however I love having this dog. I like having her around and even like the responsibility of owning her. I like the training process (she already has mastered sit, stay, leave it, down, off, touch, and stand). I am proud that I have never given a dog to a shelter and the thought of giving this wonderful, intelligent, well-behaved dog to a shelter makes me sick.\n\nMy husband and I are at an impasse, so I thought I would get outside help.

Well, Monday comes by and she didn't pick her puppy up. Wednesday morning,(around 2:00) my mom's check goes in her card and we go to a local store that sells chicken. We get back and we start eating it and giving some to our dogs.(I forgot to mention we have 2 of our own named Izzy, a black lab and Peppy, a corgi.) Anyway, I give one piece of chicken to Dollar and we finish and I go to sleep for work. When me and my mom come back from work, our aunt told us that Dollar was sleeping all day and wasn't feeling good. Next day, I saw blood on the floor and Dollar laying next to it. I told my aunt(who was cooking) and we clean it up. This morning, there was a lot of blood on the floor and in the bathroom and I clean it up. Dollar was laying next to the bed and I hear him gurgling. I see him and he is not moving. I tell my uncle who was watching tv to come here. He looked, touched Dollar and said \"He is dead\". I call my mom who was about to go to work and she comes in the house and looks at Dollar. She calls her cousin and tells my mom to bury him in our backyard. I put Dollar in 2 trash bags and put him outside while my mom and uncle went to go look for a shovel.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What's the funniest thing you've gotten in trouble for from any point from your school years?\nPOST: I had this assignment where I had to make a powerpoint presentation on a starfish (*Fromia monilis*).  Since every other kid had Keynote on their Mac and the others with Powerpoint on their PCs, the teacher used Google Documents (it has a powerpoint feature) to create one huge presentation that all of us would edit our projects onto.  If you don't know what Google Documents is, it's basically a document that everyone included in the group (through Gmail) can edit and view and it will update as people make their changes.  So, of course, people started messing around with each other's projects, so much to the point that every other Facebook post was of someone getting mad and telling people to stop in caps lock.  While I saw all these post, I came up with a brilliant idea.  I would stage a vandalization of my presentation, as a joke.  Being a stupid kid with no moral limits, I proceeded to go to my project, copy and paste a photo of Hitler on it (along with the phrase \"you dirty jew\"), take a screenshot, and finally upload it to Facebook, with the slogan, \"Too far guys, too far.\"  This triggered a number of hilarious and extreme reactions (as I wanted).  After that two days went by, we presented our projects, and everything was fine and dandy, **UNTIL**, on the third day I was called into the office to talk with the principal.  She showed me a printed version of the post and asked me about it.  Knowing that I had told plenty of people that it was a joke (apparently not enough), there was no way in hell I was going to lie and say I didn't know who did it or try to blame someone.  I had to explain to the principal that I vandalized my own presentation as a joke and I believe she gave me the \"You are the dumbest fuck in this whole school\" look.  I was given detention for breaking the use of internet agreement we all had to sign at the beginning of the year.  I was in trouble for \"cyberbullying\" myself.\nTL;DR:"}

I only gave a handjob to the second guy. \n\nThe first guy (25M) got sick of waiting for me to get comfortable before proceeding to everything below the waist; he and I never got around to physical exclusivity or a relationship, and I didn't feel comfortable doing anything below the waist with him prior to those two things (physical exclusivity for handjobs/fingering and a relationship for blowjobs/sex). When he ended things with me, he said some really hurtful things about how I should go faster in the bedroom due to my age. \n\nWith the second guy (27M), I decided go a bit faster physically. I felt comfortable enough to relax around him (with the first guy, I kept tensing up) so on the third date, I just went for it and gave him a handjob. He didn't know that I didn't have any experience with them, and I had no idea what I was doing so I'm sure it wasn't the best handjob he's ever gotten by any means. After I gave him a handjob, we were lying in his bed and talking and I asked him what he was looking for, and he mentioned that he wasn't sure if he wants a relationship or not and he's seeing multiple other girls at the moment. \n\nAnyways, since that date, he takes DAYS to respond when I send him a text, which wasn't the case before. It's very clear that he's not interested enough, and moving towards uninterested.

I've been to clubs with them and I've witnessed her grinding on him very promiscuously. When I walked up to him he clearly had a hard on. I confronted him about it and he brushed it off as me being jealous and paranoid. He said his reaction (hard on) was \"normal\" and would happen if any girl did that, not just her. When I have her over for dinner or just to hang out, they are always sitting next to each other and being \"playful.\" They will embrace each other on the couch and tickle each other.

He has other female friends he acts the same way with, but he isn't talking to them or with them 24-7 like he is with her.

We met freshmen year in college and dated until that first summer, when I broke it off with him because I was scared about how serious we were getting and thought we were too young for such intense commitment. However, sophomore year rolled around and I realized that all I wanted was him so we got back together and have been together ever since. We are now in separate graduate schools across the country and after 8 months of long distance decided to break it off two days ago.\n\nI am devastated and still love him so much but I know it is the right decision for us. Because of our graduate school programs we won't be able to be together for at least another 2 years and we mutually decided that it would be too hard on us to be long distance for so long. Additionally, I have always had this feeling that we weren't \"the ones\" for each other. Mostly because he is just a much better person than I am (nothing against myself, but he is just so kind and selfless while I am a little more hotheaded and definitely took more out of the relationship than he did which was not a healthy balance to have).\n\nHowever, even though I know it is for the best, I cannot shake this fear that I will never find someone who knows me as well as he does. He was with me through the most formative years of my life and helped me through a year of life-altering panic attacks that at one point made me too afraid to even leave my room. Because the majority of our relationship was through college, we were able to be attached at the hip in a way that is not possible in the real world. As cheesy as it sounds, he truly was my other half. I just can't imagine myself having that same kind of relationship with someone else and it is making me regret our decision to end things. How can I get over this feeling? Any advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I was out shopping for the last of my twin daughters presents and picked up a screw in my tire. No big deal I put on the donut and made it to the nearest tire place. They were closed after a few more stops, found an NTB open.  Unfortunately the screw was too close to the sidewall.  Have to get a new tire, they don't have any in stock.  I get told a location 30 miles away has it.  Ok drove over there. They tell me an hour later they don't have it.  At this point I'm out and about for 3 hours nothing accomplished and I'll be driving around on the donut until Wednesday or Thursday and have to use my Christmas budget to buy a new tire and to top it all of the tires only have 200 miles on them.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by reading my junkmail. (Possibly NSFW)\nPOST: Me (18) and my older sister (20) both still live at home. She was waiting for a package to come in the mail this morning. So she got the mail and my little sister (12) saw and wanted to help her sort it. They were going through and found a catalog that was addressed to me. This isn't totally unexpected, it happens from time to time because my information is shared from other places that I have ordered. So we started to look through and at the items inside. It had a lot of products for older people like diapers, walkers and portable \"hoppers.\" It also had some odd stuff in there as well like a two handled mug and weird shaped pillows. We had a few laughs, making fun of how uncomfortable the person modeling the pillow looked. The girls went back to sorting out the mail while I kept flipping through the booklet till I got to one page. It was filled with thick, veiny dildos varying in color and style. The look of shock and slight amusement on my face must have been noticeable because my sisters started to come over so they could see. My older sister is very righteous and would be appalled by this and tell my parents, then they would start to question what I order and maybe even my sexuality. If my little sister saw it things would escalate even more, we would possibly have to fill in the gaps for her and it would be terrible. In a panic, I just ripped the page out of the magazine, shoved it in my mouth and swallowed. They started yelling at me asking, \"What'd you do that for?\" So at this point, I just ran to my room and locked the door. I don't know where to go from here.\nTL;DR:"}

PLEASE HELP Reddit; you're my only hope.\nPOST: Hi Reddit.  This is a throwaway.\n\nMy mother works for a unified school district in the United States.  They have recently updated their systems and have moved towards computerizing everything.  She now has an email account with this school district.  She is new to computers so she just leaves her account logged in so she does not have to log in every time.  Her supervisor came in to do a routine check up on her work and proceeded to use her email account (without her permission.)  She was standing behind him while he was typing the email and did not know that he was using her account.  He did not ask her for permission.  He sent an email, essentially complaining, to the school district and signed it with her name.  He has done this on two accounts.\n\nMy mother does not have the best english, and her job does not give her very much power or leeway to immediately speak up about these things.  From what she has told me, it seems like this guy is a complete asshole who is using his power to try and undermine my mother.\n\nI am essentially asking, What are the implications of this supervisor using my mother's email AND signing an email he sent from her account with my mother's name, without her permission.  Is this illegal?  What can she do that would not hurt her job?\n\nI have saved a copy of this email, though I don't see an immediate way to prove that he was the one that sent it.  I guess the only way to differentiate would be by looking at the language that they use in the email.\nTL;DR:"}

I tried to bring up the \"where are we\" talk about a month in, but she kind of avoided it. I was thinking of asking again next time we see each other, but now I've come across an issue.\n\nRecently, she added me on Facebook, and posted a link to a pic on her Instagram account today. Being the curious kid that I am, I began to casually look at her past photos, and discovered she has a boyfriend. I was shocked, as this has never come up before. Apparently, all those times she told me she was going to a friends house meant she lied and went to see him. Having spent Valentine's Day together and agreeing when I asked her to be my valentine, I was utterly shocked.\n\nTo say I feel betrayed is an understatement, but that's another story. As of now, she texted me this morning, but I don't feel like responding. Would it be wrong to just fade away? I know if I bring up what I've said her, it might just lead to her accusing me of cyberstalking (which isn't exactly the case...she should've made her Instagram private if she didn't want the public to see).

My living arrangements have changed and I have a three or four month window of time where I won't be able to keep my cat indoors due to roommate's horrible allergy. My main question is, will a cat with no previous outdoor life be okay to live mostly outdoors as long as I keep feeding him and giving him a place to sleep/hide? It's probable that I'd be able to get a cat door installed on the garage so he could come and go like that. In August, my exgirlfriend has said she can keep him until my living arrangement gets figured out.  \n\nMy cat is a rescue and besides the first week or so of his life, has never been outside. He is large (Maine coon and rag doll mix, I'm told) and has his claws, obviously. My gut says he'd probably be okay-- he's been able to defend himself from even large dogs and stuff. I'm in Alabama, so it'll be hot this summer, but weather shouldn't be a dangerous issue. \n\nI'm currently planning on getting him microchipped and getting a good collar on him. Besides that, what can I do to reduce the chances of him just permanently disappearing? I know that's always a risk, but I'd like to keep him an indoor cat like I always have after this temporary change.   \n\nAre there any other solutions you can think of?

She talks a lot to me over the phone about how depressed she feels, and how she can barely handle getting up and going to her job anymore.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [20 F] with my BF [20 M], together for nearly 2 years. Upcoming issue (for me)\nPOST: Hey there /r/relationships! Looking for some advice on a situation that's coming up in a few months!\n\nAnyhow, My boyfriend have been together for nearly two years, for the most part we have a great time together and he's amazing. We're planning to go to England for a 1.5 month holiday at the start of december (and possibly living together next year). However, being students, we'll both head home for a month, before meeting up together and flying to England...Now the issue. \n\nIn January he (sort of?) cheated on me with another girl he met when he was at home/on New years holiday with some friends. It was never physical, but there were a number of flirtatious messages and texts (Which I never saw) exchanged between them, as well as snapchats (which I didn't know the content of). I discovered this a few days before I was due to fly to his home and spend the rest of the holidays together. After much arguing, and almost breaking up, I flew up there and we decided to see if there was anything worth salvaging. Long story short, we stayed together and our relationship has never been better. He's so much more loving and kind to me, and involves me with more of his life. And I've also made sure I put in the same effort back so we both feel loved. So yeah, everything is great in this regard. I 100% believe that he will never do this to me again.\n\n The issue I need help with, is the fact that we'll be separated for nearly a month and a half before we go to England. It's not the problem that I don't trust him not to do anything with someone else, it's just I am already anxious about having to spend so much time apart and keep having flashbacks of everything that happened in January. I was wondering if you could recommend some coping strategies to help get rid of these feelings? \n\nSorry for making this so long! I really appreciate any help!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm a transfer student looking to research psychology/sociology, which are extremely impacted majors in my area, making it a very competitive field. In one of my upper-division courses, I met my wonderful colleague and friend (we'll call her Jess) who had actually been working in the field quite some time and had already been accepted as a transfer to a nearby school. We clicked, had a blast working on projects together, and remain friends afterwards. Jess actually helped me get an amazing job in the psych field that paid MUCH better than what I made in retail. This job is a fucking blessing - it'll be my first time working with actual clients, gaining experience, and will look wonderful on grad school apps. She's been working for this company for a while and allowed me to use her as a reference. I have never been so excited to move forward! ....But here's the FU: \nNeither of us party very much, but for my birthday last Friday we smoked a bit of pot and went out for the night. We also smoked again on Sunday night. I printed out the form to get my TB test done at a health center for the company today, and notice the form also requests a drug test (unbeknownst to me, they did NOT mention this at any time in any emails or in person...) Keep in mind, I'm a 115 lb, 5'6 female with a fast metabolism. I go running every other day, but I think I fucked up here, because it will probably show up, and the test form is due today. I don't plan on going in and am hoping to push it off...apparently this is a new procedure, so she was unaware it was even an issue. So fuck. Any advice would be lovely here.\nTL;DR:"}

I started seeing people in the fall and realized that I really didn't know how to \"date\" as a big kid whose dating pool extends beyond the grade school classroom. \n\nI've casually dated a couple of people and it all goes the same way: things start out great, then they start to back off, and eventually I send the last message that never gets replied to and we never speak again. \n\nI don't go deep into personal issues, I don't whine about exes or talk about my plans for the future or marriage, I don't send four texts in a row asking where the person is or who they are with. I make it a point to ask more questions about them than talk about myself and like to think that I'm a fairly good conversationalist. \n\nBut obviously I'm not perfect, no one is, and I'm trying to figure out if these are just cases of incompatibility or if I'm breaking some sort of dating etiquette rule that I missed out on being in a monogamous relationship for so long. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that might be it is that I had been inviting the guys out to a lot of events. But this isn't necessarily coming from an \"I need to see you four times a week so I'm going to invite you out to stuff all the time\" type of thing, it's more of an \"I like your face and am going to this thing if you want to come, but if you don't I'm going to go by myself or take a friend\" type of thing. \n\nIs there a rule about invitations or something that I don't know about? Or is this just how dating goes some times?

(For a little bit of context, my parents divorced when my dad cheated, and I've also been cheated on in the past, so it's difficult for me to feel trusting of partners. I haven't really expressed these fears to my boyfriend much.) For the most part though, things have been really great between us.\n\nUnfortunately, I've started to get a little worried recently and I can't tell if it's just me overthinking things. My boyfriend had never had a password on his phone, but a few weeks ago he added one, and I commented on it one day when I noticed and asked him why he'd put one on, just out of curiosity. He told me the code but didn't explain why he'd added it in the first place. I've also noticed that, while he used to leave his phone lying around, it's now constantly attached to him. Like, he has it with him nearly 24/7 whenever we're together. I honestly don't ever feel the need to snoop through his stuff or anything like that, I think doing so would make my feelings worse, but it's starting to bother me and make me suspicious that his behaviour has changed.\n\nDeep down, I know that the solution to this problem is \"talk to him about it.\" The issue is that I have a bad habit of second-guessing myself, and I don't know whether this is an actual issue *to* discuss or just my mind getting carried away with itself.

(23 f) (26 m)\nPOST: My ex and I broke up a year ago after 2 years of dating.\n\nWe stayed friends, and he's never flirted with me or made any romantic gestures in that time. We also continued having a sexual relationship, but it really hasn't been a big deal. We had a great relationship and awesome sexual chemistry. He broke up with me because he wasn't feeling as strongly about me as he was before. Having had more relationship experience than him, I personally think that it was just the honeymoon phase passing (we had zero serious issues and were very respectful toward each other. Honestly it was the smoothest relationship I've been in). I got over it pretty quickly, I'm not the kind of person that stays upset over breakups very long, and I don't have any negative feelings toward him.\n\nHe's been texting me more flirtatious things lately, such as playfully saying I should come cuddle. Last night he came over to hang out, and said a few things that sort of have me scratching my head. He said that he \"cares about me...... a lot\", that I'm amazing and beautiful, that he feels overwhelmed when he's around me, that he's still never felt closer to any girl, that he had a dream about me the night before. I didn't know what to say, so I mostly just said thanks. When he said he's still never felt closer to any girl, I didn't say anything.\n\nWe're both very shy, and I'm a bit clueless when it comes to guys and relationships, so I'm not sure if he was indicating he would like to have a reconciliation, or if that's just wishful thinking on my part. I haven't thought about him in a romantic way in a long time, but it's something I wouldn't mind exploring again if that's on his mind.\n\nI'm not sure what to say to him, or how I would begin a conversation about us. I would be very nervous to try to talk about it, and I'm wondering if I should just shrug it off as a random thing and let it go.\nTL;DR:"}

I really like doing this, but with the combined body heat, and my arm losing circulation under her head, it gets a little bit uncomfortable after cuddling for a long time. So sometimes, I try to gently move my arm out from under her head and flip over to sleep on my other side (I generally flip around a lot when I sleep by myself, it's just a lot more comfortable).\n\nI didn't think much of this, but she gets very upset by it. She thinks it's very strange that \"I don't always want to hold her.\" I think it's strange that she thinks it's strange -- sometimes it's just uncomfortable to hold her for the entire night!\n\nShe also said that she feels like I take the time that I have with her for granted (we are in a long distance relationship, we see each other about once a month), and that if I really cherished our time in bed together, I would always want to hold her.\n\nSo essentially, she wants me to lay still and hug her for the entire night, and I just want to be able to flip around to my hearts content and not care about which way I'm facing. She's bothered because she feels like this shows that I don't love her enough. I'm bothered because it seems like she doesn't really care about my comfort/discomfort. \n\nIs she being unrealistic? Am I being selfish?\nTL;DR:"}

In the fall I wrote her a letter telling her I had feelings for her, to which she replied that she \"wishes things were different but its just not in my nature to forgive people.\" Which was fine and since then we've built a pretty good friendship, probably better than we had the first time. \n\nI'm wondering if I should tell her again how I feel? I am a completely different person now than I was the first time, and I feel like being unforgiving isn't abnormal but she's being unforgiving towards a version of me that no longer exists.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Ending a relationship with my schizophrenic girlfriend.\nPOST: Roughly 7 months ago I began a relationship with a girl who, after a month or so of dating, had informed me she was diagnosed with schizophrenia several years prior. At first I really had not noticed any of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia. I am not even sure which sub-type she falls into. Her emotional state runs the gauntlet. She frequently accuses me of mistreating her, or cheating on her. At times she is just is generally suspicious of my activities if I am not in contact with her for half a day. And not the somewhat common sterotype of a clingy girlfriend. I am talking like accusations like I have been scheming and lying to her about everything. Additionally, she is extremely hyper sexual. Initially, I thought this was just both of us having a good time and enjoying intimacy with each other. But I have come to realise, the amount of sex she wants, the frequency with which she watches porn (sometimes very hardcore stuff) and how often she has told me she masturbates, may be something pathological.\n\nNow over the last month or two I have started to noticed even more pronounced oddities in her behavior and her thought process. Specifically, she has demonstrated, what I think is, black and white thinking. For the psychologists out there, is this not typically seen in BPD, or can it be seen to some extent in schizophrenics? Anyway, what I am essentially saying is, I am not sure if it healthy for myself, and especially for her to continue this relationship. I am worried, though, about how I can end this without her exploding on me, as she frequently does anyway. Reddit, lend me your advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I've come to Reddit seeking answers for my questions, and to help me get a better idea of how to be a supportive boyfriend. Can we have a normal relationship? How can I let her know I am there for her? Will she be sexually and emotionally closed off, or, with time, will she learn to trust that I'm not going to hurt her?

So now that I kind of am, I think some of the things I've learned aren't completely applicable. For example, it's commonly known over on r/seduction or r/highseddit that it's best not to text a girl back immediately just so that you don't come across as desperate/needy. I believe this is the right way to go, since when girls do that to me, I am somewhat turned off cause it's \"too easy\", if you understand... not a challenge. \n\nBeen seeing a girl recently and I'd like to go for more than just a casual hookup. Never tried doing this before, I've always stuck with the once-off hookups at parties or casual hookups for no more than a month or so.\n\nHow do I change my interactions with her to fit this approach, rather than just going for a casual hookup? Do I talk to her more? I've noticed that my buddies who are trying to have a relationship with a girl text them nearly all day just talking about god knows what. This is counter-intuitive for me since i've been indoctrinated by seddit that that's NOT the way to go hahaha. But I feel like to gain a better connection with this girl, I have to talk to her a lot more than just to set up dates.\n\nShould I still give time in between texts? If I get a text when she sends it now, judging on the momentum of the conversation, I'll wait anywhere from ~5-~45 minutes to text back... should I just text back with no regard for seduction info?\n\nIn case you can't tell I'm a bit lost hahaha\nTL;DR:"}

She calls me all the time just to check on how I'm doing and I feel so annoyed by it (I shouldn't though...but I still do). I like to think that I'm quite mature and can handle situations really well. However, whenever I talk to my mom I feel so annoyed.

I understand I may be beating the question like a dead horse, but we haven't had any good solutions yet. The only real resolution we've just came to is that I should masturbate when she's not in the mood. That doesn't really help the situation, if anything it makes me wish I was having sex more. \n\nI know about the possibilities of birth control interfering with her sex drive, but she's been on it long before we started having sex. I have no reason to believe she is cheating on me, and yes I understand the honeymoon period is over but I would expect at least some sex on a more regular basis.

We shared a lot of hobbies and interests and did a lot of cool things. Unfortunately over the past couple months she has become progressively more and more depressed. \n\nShe doesn't have any passion for anything anymore. She's in a routine where all she sees is how unhappy and bored she is with her life. Over the past weeks it's difficult to even communicate with her because she doesn't seem to think anything she does is interesting enough to contribute to the conversation. \n\nThere just isn't any motivation to do anything we used to enjoy. Sex drive has gone downhill, which isn't the biggest deal for me if it wasn't reflective of how she felt about the rest of her life. \n\nWhat I want is some way to help her. I fucking love her and I want to find some way to make her happy. I had managed to get her to see a therapist but that only lasted a few weeks before it \"got too stressful\", probably due to the cost and exposing thoughts she was embarassed about. I've tried suggesting it again but I have been avoiding being confrontational about it.\n\nIt's getting draining for me to try to help her on my own and there aren't many other people she has to lean on. What can I do? Help her find a hobby? Help her make friends? Force her to see a therapist? I'm almost at a loss. I just want to be good for her.\nTL;DR:"}

Things ended fairly amicably, even though I took it hard, but we wanted different things so we went our separate ways.  When we spoke in July I talked about getting back together, and she felt it wasn't a good idea so we continued doing no contact after that.  Now it is her birthday coming up soon, and I have been debating whether or not to break the no contact just to wish her a Happy Birthday, which seems reasonable, but now shes invited me out (via social media) to a group event just before her birthday.  This seems like a stupid question, but should I go?  Or do I continue with the no contact seeing as I still would still be open to getting back together if it came up, but I have zero expectation that the invite is anything more than just a friendly gesture.  There will be a few other people at the event I know, but really the only person that I was ever close with is the ex.

Not quite being ghosted but he [22M] stopped initiating.\nPOST: Backstory: So I have met this guy online about 2 months ago. Not on a dating site though, we have kinda hit it off over our mutual academic interests. We have decided to meet after back and forth texting for a month. And we did. We had loads of fun, agreed to do that again and left. We used to chat day and night and the same continued after we have met too. Due to me being away and his schedule we couldn't meet again for the next two weeks but maintained contact and still talked about the things we could do once we have the chance. We have talked almost everyday. If I didn't write he did and so on. So he was obviously interested.\n\nNow for the last two weeks, he all of a sudden he started not answering messages for days and such and even though I knew he has an hectic schedule I overreacted calling him rude, and made some passive aggressive comments about the whole thing. I have dumb overreactions I should work on that. Then I have sent him an apology text which he ignored. After a week I have sent a random \"I did this and it was fun, wanted to share it with you\" kinda text to which he was completely receptive. We have talked for a while and that's it. A day later, another small conversation over text that I initiated, this time I ended it after two messages because I didn't want to be clingy. Again he was receptive and overall sounded in a good mood.\n\nNow it has been a week and he didn't write or call. I am not experienced with dating, so what should I do? I really want to see him again but I don't want to look like I am desperate. I am not even entirely sure I want to 'date' him. But I quite enjoy his company. I think he is rather attractive. Should I give him a call? Should I stop trying to make it happen all together?\nTL;DR:"}

He use to take care of his body really well and prioritize his life putting the most important things first. Basically, he was a mature college kid.\n\nHe dropped out of college because it was too much and he really needed money so he picked up a full time job.

He is in so much debt and its wild to think about all the money he could be saving yet hes smoking it away.\n\nDont get me wrong I have nothing against weed but to do it everyday and there's nothing in your bank account...well that's a problem.

She is 30, lives with her parents, and is depressed. She hasn't started her career yet, and is struggling to find a job in teaching which is a very difficult field to break into. \n\nWe have a very loving and supportive relationship. We have similar views of the world, and goals, but we \"talk\" about moving in together, but it seems so far away/like it's never going to happen.\n\nShe hasn't kept a job for more than a few months doing manual labour, and is currently volunteering to break into teaching, but I'm doubtful it will work out. The last time she volunteered, she was late, cancelled last minute for feeling \"sick\" etc. So, I worry this won't work out in the way she hopes it will. \n\nShe also has a very messy room that she has been cleaning for over 2 years with no dents made. I can tell she's frustrated with where she is in life, but seems stuck and hasn't made actual strides towards achieving her goals. She is the oldest of 3 children, and both are moved out and one is married. \n\nWhen we first started dating, we both talked about how we had broken up with people who didn't have life plans/weren't pursuing their dreams. \n\nBut, still. I don't know what to do. I don't see anything changing in her life, and I can only be so supportive-sending her job postings, offering to help her with organizing, being there.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [20M] have mixed feelings about my relationship with my girlfriend [19F]\nPOST: I have been in a relationship with my S.O. for about four years now.  We've been together since 11th grade in high school and now attend the same university.  We see each other pretty much every day in addition to texting & talking on the phone.\n\nI guess it seems like we have a pretty healthy and happy relationship; we're able to get through most problems by communicating and compromising.  We are best friends and always try to make time for each other.  Since we've been together for so long we're very comfortable with one another and have been told before that we act like we're married already.\n\nHere's my problem:  I love this girl to death but I've been experiencing a yearning for novelty in my life.  While the problem does not necessarily originate entirely from the relationship I feel that it may be a major contributor.  It's hard to meet new people on campus when most of my time is spent with her and I essentially feel like I'm living the same life as I did in high school.\n\nSomething that is a little frightening at the moment is that she's really excited and ready to get married and have kids with me.  While she seems to be 100% positive that I am the one she wants to marry, I am not as enthusiastic about it.  She has it all planned out and would like to get married in X amount of years and have children in Y amount of years  There's other behaviors I would like to share but will refrain from doing so in order to remain anonymous, but you get the idea--she's sort of that type of girl.  I'm starting to think she's a little crazy...\n\nAgain, I really love her and while I dread the thought of breaking up with her, I also see it as an opportunity to experience new people, women, and other things.  Simply put:  life has been stagnant for years and I think it might be time for a change.  Is breaking up the answer?  I am afraid that if I tell her how I feel it will go horribly wrong.  We have a really strong bond and it would be a shame for it to be ruined as a result.\nTL;DR:"}

Someone will want more.\n\nThis happens more or less each time she breaks up with a guy, we start up having sex and just hanging out again and it's nice until she starts dating someone again or we just lose touch after a while (note; I am not faulting her for finding someone as we are both pretty vocal about that being an option for both of us).\n\nI don't know why I am even writing this, as an ama, as a confession, asking for general advice. Just, I want to talk about it and don't know how. It doesn't help I am torn between more than one girl I am romantically interested in and I just like holding someone, she recently found out her ex fiance was cheating on her so I'm well aware I am a rebound but right now I'm fine with it, I like being needed.\nTL;DR:"}

I'll try to keep this short...\n\nA bit of background: my ex and I are each others first everything, and we were together for just over 5 years. He broke up with me in January, after being very distant since November. During that time frame, he neglected me and hung out with lots of friends of his that were previously acquaintances and that I didn't know. I was never invited out with them and never met them, and he admitted to at least one girl out of that group having the hots for him.\n\nHe seemed to be doing great after the breakup, whereas I was an absolute mess and totally heartbroken. We did 4.5 months of no contact, where I got better and started to heal, but we broke no contact, one thing led to another and now we are talking again. He has since told me that he absolutely wants to try again, thinks I've become a more \"well rounded person\" and that he loves and wants me.\n\nI'm seriously considering trying again, but I have a question. Is it unfair of me to ask that my ex that he cut contact with the people he hooked up with when we were apart? Or if not cut contact with, minimize interactions with? I suspect that he probably did hook up with some of them, potentially even sleep with some, and this makes me really uncomfortable.\nTL;DR:"}

Is this foundation ok for serious relationship/marriage?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been in a serious relationship for 3 years. Both of us are 26 and love each other very much. However, there a few red flags I can't continue to ignore if we are going to continue to date... (and maybe get married?) I would love to get your opinion on whether they are as major as I feel.\n\nMy bf's mom is a widow. The entire family was very affected by the dad's passing because it was a very sudden, unexpected passing. My bf's mom is very dependent on her son for emotional support and for financial support. Currently, my boyfriend financially supports his mom and his sister. He has become a stand-in father figure. I am very very proud of him and try my best to be supportive.\n\nAlthough she is incredibly accomplished, smart, and educated (she has a PHD and also went to an Ivy League school), bf's mom has been unemployed for a very long time.... She is \"not ready\" to start applying for jobs, but has made a few misguided decisions to invest in really sketchy (probably scams) networking sessions, online prep programs, and professional organizations.\n\nUnlike posts I see on rant or offmychest or justnomil, I find his mom caring and thoughtful, despite sometimes being mildly inappropriate with oversharing personal finance issues (she said her son \"I'm glad you didn't keep sucking me dry after you graduated, unlike your sister\") and misguided racism* (over a meal, she said \"you were an anchor baby, huh!\" and added a wink... I am Asian American and my parents are too... AND she has an adopted daughter who is Asian so I feel like she doesn't mean to say inappropriate things, she just doesn't realize how bad they sound).\n\nAs a bit of background, my family and I are emotionally very independent. What's most concerning to me is this: My dad is in a similar position and my extended family (his 2 sisters, brother, and mom) depends on him financially. My mom and dad fight about this (I never see them fight about anything else).\nTL;DR:"}

It was a pretty casual, friendly conversation, with maybe some slight innocent flirting (he said to her at one point \"it's a bummer we don't work together more often!\" for example). She was also very beautiful, so I freaked out. I am beautiful too but I have low self-esteem, so I completely thought the worst, as in he contacted her because he was into her.\n\nSo I discussed it with him and apologized for snooping. He was very understanding and told me she was only 17, so he definitely didn't see her that way, and that it doesn't matter at all because he loves me and would never cheat on me or leave me for someone else. He said at that time he messaged her, she was having \"family drama\" and had been talking to him about it at work. He saw she was online and decided to see how she was doing and cheer her up.\n\nI guess my concern still is that is it normal for guys in relationships to talk to their attractive coworkers outside of work? I personally don't use instant messaging so I find it hard to relate. My boyfriend is an extremely friendly person, and I know for a fact he is friendly with everyone at work, so maybe he is just the same way online? I just can't seem to get passed how pretty she is and think he was messaging her because he wanted to talk to a pretty girl:( He had text messaged and talked to this other girl from his work in the past but I never batted an eye because she wasn't prettier than me in my opinion. The 17 year old on the other hand, is very pretty. I KNOW how petty and dumb this sounds. I'm actually working with a therapist to combat these thoughts. I just want someone to tell me that what he did was totally innocent and normal.\nTL;DR:"}

He just graduated college and is still pursuing higher education and climbing the ranks of his new job. Reddit, who pushes you indirectly to strive in life?\nPOST: Around the time of his high school years, he started selling weed, which wasn't that terrible, but still not good. He was never the one to actually use drugs, he only sold them (I know, it sounded a bit ironic to me.) But after a while, he escalated to cocaine and such, and that got out of hand. Selling to a neighbor, who nearly died of an overdose. That's when he cut the line of his ways, and soon after that he was expecting a baby boy. He got off his ass, and went to pick up a real job at 16, because of the embarrassment he didn't want to face by not being able to properly provide for his child(ren). After the baby was born, he continued in high school, eventually graduated with 2 scholarships on his belt. Carried on to college, and in the middle of his second year, he was expected a baby girl. He upgraded his supermarket job, to a bank, where he was able to be provided enough of an income to provide for his girlfriend, schooling, his baby and his upcoming baby girl. Three months ago, she was born, and last month he graduated. He's moving on to a university in Florida, and maintains stability in his life.\n\nHe showed me that no matter how bad situations seem, you have to keep your cool. You can't give up because things look bad. Not many people would have expected him to even graduate high school. He had a \"crew\" in a way, just 2 very good friends of his that were as bad, if not worse, than he was. One's in prison, serving 15 years, while the other took matters into his own hand, after seeing my brother's accomplishments, and joined the military.

I'm currently debating whether I should turn down this job offer and move to Seattle with him, or do long distance for at least a year (after which I hope to go to medical school).\n\nThere are several reasons why I would want to take the job offer and try to do long-distance. First, Seattle and SF aren't that far apart (only a 2 hour flight and same time zone), so it's not too long-distance. Second, the salary is decent ($50k + health benefits), and job security is always nice. Third, my family is from SF, so I would be living at home rent-free. Fourth, a lot of my friends from high school/college will be living in the SF Bay Area, whereas Seattle would mean establishing a new social network.\n\nThere are also several reasons why I would want to move. First, I have a bachelor's in public health, but this position (basic HR/office-type role) is not related to my field of study. Second, I'm not sure I could make long-distance work. I care deeply for my boyfriend, and I can't bear to be apart from him. Third, Seattle would present the opportunity to start anew; I've lived in the same part of the country my whole life, and this could be a learning experience. Fourth, I dislike living at home, and if I moved to Seattle, my mom would kick out my freeloading SIL from the SF house and rent out the house (negates point 3 above).\nTL;DR:"}

We are also currently attending the same college and actively seeking a place so we can finally live together. For the most part we have a great relationship and have only had a few minor bumps in the road.\n\nThere's been a problem I've noticed lately though, any time I ask him to do anything that involves my family he gets angry or upset and pleads me not to make him go. I don't understand why, seeing as my family loves him and has been nothing but kind to him. The current problem is that my uncles are coming into town and they as well as my parents are going on a hike and then getting some lunch. Seeing as I love doing things with my boyfriend and he's never met this part of my family, I invited him to go. Now he's pleading me to not make him go, and telling me this is not his family so he shouldn't have to (which really hurts my feelings seeing as my parents see him as family as well as my other relatives). \n\nThis isn't the only time he's done this either, when I asked him to visit my grandparents with me, for a single day, he threw a huge fit but eventually went. And guess what? He even admitted it wasn't that bad.\n\nI just feel like if you tell someone you want to marry them one day it shouldn't be so difficult to spend a day with their family, seeing as it only happens MAYBE once every six months.

So I told the clerk that red stands for cancel (as politely as one can after witnessing such an act). She ignored me. So, clearly, the most reasonable thing to do when something doesn't work, is to do the exact same thing again thinking that you were right the first time, something just went wrong with the computer.

I have no problem with it in principle and I strongly support its legalization. However, I have serious moral qualms with buying and using illegal drugs in the U.S. because it is part of a violent and exploitative system which hurts many people. Therefore, I have never purchased or smoked marijuana, ever. \n\nMy situation: \nI suffer from a chronic pain syndrome. I am in pain all the time, but every month or so, for several days at a time, the pain is unbearable. It does not respond to narcotic pain medication, and it interferes with my job, my marriage/sex life, my relationships, my sleep, and my mood. I am very depressed and cry often. I have tried every conventional treatment and many experimental ones. Nothing has helped. \n\nMy Dilemma:\nI have heard that the illness I have often responds well to medial marijuana. I live in a state where medical marijuana is legal, but not for my condition, so there is no hope of getting it from a doctor. A friend has offered to buy me some home-grown marijuana from a friend and let me try it to see if it helps. However, I would feel like a hypocrite to use marijuana to treat my pain when I generally oppose it's illegal use. Also, I am terrified of getting caught/arrested/randomly tested.

I tried to explain as best as I could but nothing helped. She's deadset on the fact that I'm emotionally cheating. She went to stay with her sister and won't take any of my calls. I'm all out of ideas. How do I fix this\nTL;DR:"}

I've been told time and time again about his interest in me, especially by her, but I've been having second thoughts considering how receptive he is to her flirting.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: 5 years later, I'm [21F] feeling guilty about my parents divorce.\nPOST: Let me start by saying my Father and I never had a good relationship due to my teenage angst at the time, I was 16 when my parents divorced and my dad and I fought every day up until the day I moved into my moms new house. For this reason, when I look back at my parents divorce now, as 21 year old woman, I feel guilty. My mom and I have always been very close, and even as a teenager it was clear she cared about me and my feelings much more than she cared about anything else. So when my dad and her were having problems, and she was contemplating leaving him, I encouraged it because I couldn't stand living in the house with him anymore. Don't get me wrong, my dad did have some problems in the past (he first was a recovered drug addict before the divorce and then in recent years became sober of alcohol as well.) My mom got sick of his issues, as well as the mean attitude that came with them, and ended up connecting with an ex on Facebook and basically just up and left my dad, rushed into a marriage with her new husband who she now resents. She says every day how unhappy she is. She constantly tells me how she misses my dad, but says it could never work because of the way he treats her. Now that my dad has been through a lot of therapy and has really changed his path, we get along great now. Being that he never had any family besides my mom's family, he feels really lonely and it's kind of obvious he's waiting for my mom because he knows she's unhappy. Every time I visit, I'm faced with the feeling of guilt because I feel like I could have prevented this pain he's feeling, as well as my two siblings felt based on the divorce. I was the only one happy at the time about the divorce, and now, 5 years later, I feel the most guilt and sadness. My dad has changed so much, and I don't know what to do to make this better. Or just to make myself feel better. Really need some advice. Thanks in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

Shortly before we got married, We decided to move out of state to my home city in CT from Montana which was a choice made based on my career path BUT one that she was excited to make as well. \n\nThings didn't go as planned for her. She did not get on well with my family which started because of something she did but they didn't respond well either. We ended up buying a house and settling anyway. In that time, she did make some friends and got a job in her field. My career eventually took me in a direction that's been really great for me. Lots of travel and a supportive work environment. I'm finally feel like I'm in the right place. She however feels understandably stuck. She doesn't love her job or make enough money. She also really wants to have kids which we can't afford. \n\nWe are at a crossroads. She wants to move back to her hometown in Montana.  Her parents and siblings all live there and she believes she'll have better opportunities for work. She is actively applying for jobs there as I type. She did so without really asking me. I've always said I'd be willing to go back but I'm not willing to give up my job which is looks like I'll have to do. And even if they will let me work remotely from MT, I'll still be traveling so much that it would be hard to have kids. She says she doesn't want me to quit but I believe that's she conclusion she wants me to come to on my own. \n\nWhat should I do? She's decided she'll go with or without me but when I tell her that I don't know if I want to go anymore she accusing me of picking some job over her when it's really me just picking my life. I just can't see leaving a job I love to be unemployed and living at her parents house. I love her and I want this to work but I'm afraid we've reached a point of no return.

How can I bond with my kitty?\nPOST: My relationship with my cat has been a bit rocky since I got him about a year and a half ago. He was about five months old, if I recall correctly. He does occasionally sit on my lap, and he has affectionately head-butted me on the face a few times, which I absolutely LOVE. Most of the time, though, he'll try to bite my hand when I pet him and generally does not pay too much attention to me. Even worse, every now and then he will get this look on his face where he flares his nostrils, perks his ears up, and tilts his head, and I know he is going to jump and attack me. It is never very vicious, and I can just walk away, so it is not a major cause of concern for me. However, he does not exhibit this behavior with anybody else who lives in my house. He seems to really have taken a liking to one roommate in particular. He gets excited when she comes home, climbs all over her, spends a lot of time in her room, and never tries to bite her when she pets him. It breaks my heart.

He hasn't said anything to me, we are not the closest of cousins but we have known each other since we were younger. \n\nThis has been going on since June 10th at least all I could tell from the messages sent.

There's a girl on my floor who I'm all but certain likes me. However, I don't know her very well (as one can see from me being unsure of her age). I like her too, but it's more of a form of infatuation or physical attraction rather than a serious romance. Furthermore, I don't see us ever getting into a long-term relationship, for a variety of reasons (e.g. not really my type), although we don't really know much about each other. I don't know if she has the same sort of feeling about me, or if she would like a relationship. So, I'm seeking advice on how I should proceed. From how I see it, I have 3 options. \n\n* I could pursue a short-term fling with her, but I don't want to lead her on and end up upsetting her if she actually wanted a long-term relationship. \n\n* Or, I could ask her what she wants out of a relationship between us, although this runs the same risk as the previous option, just to a lesser degree. \n\n* Finally, I could wait it out until her intentions become more clear to me, and if we don't want the same thing, I can end it before it starts to hopefully minimize the negative feelings. The downside to this is that I get distracted thinking about it during class, and I'll have just wasted time if she wanted a short-term thing too.\n\nOr perhaps you have other options to recommend to me. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: Any experience with perineal urethrostomy (PU) surgery?\nPOST: Background Info:\n\nI have a 6 year old neutered male cat who has developed cystitis in the last 4 years. The first 2 years, he would have an occasional UTI. I think he had maybe 3 total in those 2 years. When he was 4, we moved 12hrs away. The move was stressful for him and he had his first blockage. We rushed him to the emergency vet. Luckily, the pain meds allowed him to relax enough that he unblocked before they used a catheter. His second block was 4 months later. This was a full block. He was given a catheter and a 2 day stay in the hospital. From that point on, he had a cystitis inflammation about every other month. Always struvite crystals. Not always an infection. \nDuring this time, he was always on a wet food diet. Before he blocked, he was on wet foods like Fromm, Wellness, and Before Grain. After he blocked, we tried Science Diet CD. It didn't help. So we switched to Purina UR. It didn't help. I finally switched him back to the grain free foods he was eating before. He went 6 months without a problem (a long time for how he had been doing). Then he had another flare up. Took him to the vet and then he was fine for another 4 months.\n\nThursday, I returned from work to find, he was fully blocked again. Another trip to the emergency room. It went smoothly and he is back home and back to normal now.\n\nTechnically, he has had 3 blocks (3 strikes, you're out) although he cleared his first on his own. So now we are looking at the PU surgery. Despite pamphlets and vet info, I don't know anyone who has had this done. It is a very sensitive surgery with a long, difficult recovery time. Ideally, this would keep him from ever blocking again. But I would lie if I said I wasn't scared.\n\nHas anyone been through a PU surgery with one of their animals? What was recovery like? Has your animal had any complications/side effects?\nTL;DR:"}

I was upset at my gf for not telling me this sooner, and more upset that he thought that way - he's actively looking for reasons to dislike me. \n\nThe toughest part is that I can't speak to him - we literally speak different languages.

She cheated on me a couple of years ago, during a time when I was holding her at a distance, both physically and mentally.\n\nShe claims that her cheating, while inexcusable, was nonetheless a result of my holding her at a distance.\n\nNow, whenever something makes me uncomfortable or I have any questions for her, she insists that we can't move on with our lives unless I trust her, and that if I'm really worried about her cheating, I should work on the health of our relationship.  Because, if the relationship is healthy, there won't be cheating.\n\nMy opinion is that some people are just prone to cheating, and with such people, they need to avoid certain situations.\n\nFor some people, they can be totally happy and in a great relationship, but they could still cheat.\n\nWhat say you, reedit?\nTL;DR:"}

For example, when I introduced my girlfriend to them for the first time, my mother grilled me for hours because I forgot to hold the car door open for her. \n\nAnyways, we went to my house for dinner, and afterwards she offered to help clean the table to me, but I told her, as a guest, she could just kick back and relax, no worries. Anyways, later on, my mother pulls me aside and accuses me of dating a \"bratty precious princess\" because she didn't help clean the table. I explained that she offered and I told her not to worry, but it never seemed to sink in. \n\nIt seems to have done irreparable damage to their opinion of her, and she means the world to me so I feel like I'm caught in the crossfire between them.\nTL;DR:"}

She couldn't bear with the pain of not being able to help me, and I kept losing sight of the happiness we made together.\n\nShe finally realized all of this when she went away to summer camp for five weeks, meeting new friends and rediscovering the importance of those bonds that I took away from her. During that time we didn't talk as much on Skype so it left me to think about the errors I made, how empty I truly was, and how unhealthy my depending on her was. I don't have much friends because of my cynical personality and many of my burdens were left for her to deal with. It was too late to ask for another chance, but here we are today.\n\nWhen the call ended, I was crying for a bit and feeling like crap because I wish she gave me that happiness again as a girlfriend, but I realized that we were still friends, and she still cared for me as a person.\n\nI don't feel shitty anymore, at least I don't feel I should. I'm not all ready to meet more people in college, but I definitely have a different view of people and determined to search for my own happiness. I learned a lot from this almost three year long relationship with her.\n\nI feel the need to be proud of my climbing out of the hole I've dug for so long, so I'm telling this to whoever reads this post.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What are some ways to lessen the cost of more drinking water for my school?\nPOST: I am a teacher at a small private high school in Massachusetts.  In recent weeks, faculty use of the water cooler has become an issue with administration.  Many of us on the faculty carry Nalgenes and other water bottles around the school.  The faculty room is the only water cooler we have access to, and it's two stories below some of our classrooms.\n\nAdministration has responded that teachers aren't to take any of the water out of the faculty room.  It is fine to drink up during lunch or a free period, but we cannot fill up our large water bottles and bring them back to our classrooms.\n\nDepending upon each teacher's schedule (and the location of their classroom), this can be troublesome.  For example, it is not unusual for a teacher on the third floor to have classes the first four periods of the day, lunch duty in the cafeteria, and then a class following lunch before getting a free period.  Such a schedule would leave this teacher hard-pressed for an opportunity to adequately \"drink up\" between 7:30AM (the start of homeroom) and 12:25PM (the end of fifth period).  While it is now into Fall and classrooms aren't necessarily sweltering anymore, hydration is unfortunately not simply a seasonal concern.\n\nThe frustration sets in when it is okay to drink (for example) six 6-ounce cups of water (36 ounces total) in a hurry between classes, but not okay to fill up a 32-ounce Nalgene and drink it at your leisure in your classroom over the course of a morning.  At the same time, administration has a very limited budget and wants to curb those who might be using excessive amounts of water (such as filling up before they leave for the day).  Both sides have valid points, which has led to the search for a compromise.\n\nOne of my colleagues tried to calculate how much it would cost teachers out-of-pocket to defray the cost of ordering more water jugs each month.  She presented the plan and figures (such as per-teacher cost per month), but it didn't seem to get very far.  Apparently more specifics or a more feasible plan are needed.\nTL;DR:"}

Every morning, I go down to the common area of my dorm and I get a bag of Tropical Skittles (I have a terrible Skittles addiction). I put my dollar in the vending machine, pressed D6 and the fucker gets stuck. From there, I went to my Cultural Anthropology class, where I bombed my first quiz (last night I had done some major studying for that class, so I felt mega let down). Fast forward, I went back to my dorm to sleep (I hadn't slept the night prior to all this), but couldn't because my dad called saying my grandmother passed away last night. My family was kind of expecting it, because we had tried to put her into a nursing home close to us so we could take care of her. She refused, saying she wanted to stay home. Needless to say, I feel a huge amount of unnecessary guilt. I digress. I had two hours between classes, so, hey, given the fact that I couldn't nap after the sad news, I went to go buy my college textbooks. I had spent my last paycheck (with tips) on 300+ dollars worth of books that I had to buy brand fucking new (there is some online access code we need to take our tests). Finished buying my books, I dredged into my last class. Now, I have some pretty bad issues with depression. Usually when things get pretty bad, I go hang out with friends to get my mind off things, but I moved away from my hometown (Austin) to go to Texas State University (San Marcos), meaning everyone I could go to get my mind off things is unreachable. So out of desperation, after class, I asked some random person who sat behind me if she wanted to do something, which was hard for me to do because, again, I knew no one here. Essentially, I have obtained social anxiety (which I'm not used to). Anyway, she said she was commuting back to Austin to go home. Cool, I get that. I asked for her number, and she tells me that she lives with her boyfriend. I asked what that had to do with anything, that I was just looking for a friend, and she just kinda laughed it off and went away. So now I'm stuck at home after a terrible fucking day.\nTL;DR:"}

Although I already got some great responses there, I thought it would be ok to get you guys's word on it as well.\n\nI sold my used 98 corolla 3+ weeks ago to an old couple. I had priced it higher than KBB value because craigslist loves to negotiate. But this couple never bothered me with negotiation and bought it at the advertised price. Fast forward to 3 weeks during which they drove it around without issues, they get new tires and were recommended to get alignment done. The mechanic at alignment gave them bunch of stuff that needs to be fixed/repaired. Repair cost estimate is 1900 according to them. They were also told that wheels were in pretty bad shape and should be replaced as well. Now they are all over me to pay for the repair cost or atleast the half of it, accusing me that I knew about all of the repairs that would be required. I feel bad for them really, so I offered them 400 dollars, but they have put the limit on 600 and if I don't pay them, they are planning to sue me. Most bothersome part is the accusation of cheating. If they hadn't accused me and took me on a guilt trip I might have actually already refunded them 600, but who's to assure me that they won't threaten me again with something else in few days ? Also, I didn't do a single thing outside the moral/ethical or legal code. Please also note that the husband asked me if he could write 1200 as the purchase price on the title to save on some taxes. The actual sale price is double of that.\nAny suggestions ? Advice ?

Despite me notifying my previous health insurance company of my termination, they advised me my coverage remained effective until 09/06/2012 throughout numerous conversations and letters.

Now, I have a bill for roughly $3K; large enough to ruin me at this point in my life, but not large enough to warrant lawyer fees. Question: Where does the responsibility rest?

That's always been great with me even though I am somewhat the opposite building my future for law school. \n\nHowever, today we didn't talk much and I didn't hear much from her. She got off of work and I still hadn't heard from her which was a bit odd. Finally, I fell asleep and stupidly called her when I woke up which was around 2 am. She (understandbly) demanded to know why I was calling her at 2 and then after a few brief words she said bye and we hung up. \n\nI felt hurt since we hadn't spoken and i had no idea how she was doing. That being said I was kind of upset. And i know these are all the wrong feelings to be feeling, Reddit mainly because this isn't my personality. The last long term relationship I had was over a year ago with girls and non serious relationships since then.

A little over a month ago, she broke up with her ex boyfriend, lets say the last time they had sex was 31 days ago. The past I dont know, week or so she has been having a lot of pregnancy symptoms. We had sex for the first time 10 days ago, and maybe 6 times since then in those 10 days. She has the morning sickness,nausea, food aversion, painful breasts, she is always feeling bad and has thorwn up multiple times. And of course the big one, she missed her period. What is the time frame for these things? She (we) are worried that if she is pregnant, theres a chance it would have been from her ex a month ago and the symptoms are coming now. Does that sound right, or does it sound like its more possible this might have happened during one of the early times we had sex, first being like I said, 10,maybe 11 days ago. A little fun fact to add in is that I was about 9 days into my first ever /r/nofap journey the first time we had sex and though I have never intentionally finished in her, i'm sure that build up caused some to get out before I had a chance to.

I got back from a spring break trip last week and it is hitting me more and more how much I screwed up. While I didn't \"technically\" cheat on him (didn't kiss anyone or anything else), I did cuddle/spoon with multiple guys on the trip multiple nights. When I came back, I casually mentioned this to him, but didn't give him the full details of what had happened. He seemed worried, but dropped it. After a day of talking with mutual friends, looking at Facebook pictures, etc., he confronted me about it and was incredibly hurt. He talked about how it was a huge breach of trust, how spooning was something \"we do\", and how emotional/close sleeping with someone was. After realizing all this, I broke down and we cried/talked through the whole night. It's been about a week since the original encounter and things have been getting better, but he still obviously thinks about it (as do I) and I know that it hurts him a lot. I'm trying to figure out how to heal this for both of us without sweeping it under the rug.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Fianc\u00e9 is upset I waited too long to marry her\nPOST: Hi Reddit,\nThis is my first post on reddit, and this is also a throwaway account. \n\nHere's the situation: My fianc\u00e9 is 28 and I'm 27. We met at University (in our 4th year of five), and began living together almost immediately. We shared an on-campus apartment and I slept in her room just about every night. After graduation we lived apart briefly (about a year) because I took a job about 90 miles away from her. \n\nShe was living with her parents. After that year (we'd been together about 2.5 years), i got a new job closer to her, and suggested we move back in with eachother. She wanted to get engaged before moving in together, and I never proposed. I wasn't ready. We would get into really intense discussions about what we were doing living together if I wasn't ready to propose. One particularly tough night I told her \"I'm not ready to marry you because I'm still trying to figure out if I want to.\" She hasn't forgotten that one yet. \n\nFast forward. I proposed to her year before last in November (we've had a long engagement), and she said yes! We're getting married in September. But she's telling me now that she's not excited about the wedding, and that she feels like we've been married for years now. She's mad that I wasn't ready to marry her, and that she had to make the decision to stay with me when she was ready to marry me and I wasn't ready to marry her. I love her, and I can't imagine my life without her. She says she loves me, and wants to be with me, but she feels that she can't get excited about the wedding and she only feels stressed about it all. What I'd really like is to find a way to get her excited about the wedding again. \n\nHave any redditors gone through anything like this? What can I do to spice up our relationship and get her excited about marrying me again?\nTL;DR:"}

I've asked him countless times to take up more responsibilities, to go work out, etc. I just sometimes feel suppressed as an individual and sometimes hate myself for being harsh to him.

In retrospect it occurred to me she was happy to do me a kindness and there I was, saying no, I wanted nothing to do with her small gift.

My worst was about a pack or two a day but I've come down since then.\n\nAll of a sudden he's saying he wants me to quit now. He reasoning is because my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and my father has been smoking since he was 16. He's in his 50's now. My boyfriend's dad also had a heart attack from smoking. He's now worried that I'm more in danger of dying at a younger age and he says he \"wants to spend the rest of our lives long and healthy, not short with pain and suffering\"\n\nI understand his concerns but does it make sense that it's a deal breaker? He doesn't understand how hard it is to quit because he was never a smoker. Ever since my dad was diagnosed and his dad had a heart attack (two months apart from each other) they've both quit smoking. I understand he wants what's best for my health and he's seen two people close to use get really hurt from the habit, but is he out of place in demanding I stop smoking or he's leaving?\nTL;DR:"}

The main goal is to get myself into better shape, but more important, to get me healthier overall.\n\nWhen I was in high school I had packed 320 pounds on my 6'2\" frame. Once I graduated from high school, all it took was one girl breaking my poor little angsty heart for me to invest in my health. Over the course of 2 years, I lost 140 pounds and was down to 180. I didn't do it by working out almost at all. I simply changed my portion size but not my diet, counted calories, etc. In other words, I got skinny fat. I was 180 pounds but still dreadfully out of shape. It worked for a while. \n\nEventually, I fell off the wagon, I started getting older and have put back on about 40 pounds and am up to 225. I am now 26 and the aches and pains of an abused body is starting to kick in far too young. I have to start taking care of myself. I would like to get back down to 180, but the healthy way, instead of the way i did it before: eating garbage, but not a lot of garbage.\n\nI've already put together a decent diet consisting of whole foods, fruits, veggies and lots of chicken. This is good because I love chicken and have a ton of healthy recipes I've managed to scrounge up.\n\nBut today, I start the actual working out part. I am starting with the Couch to 5k program that I've heard good things about and my brother who is military and works at a gym is helping me put together a weight program. I'm really excited about this and hope to be a healthy person for it. Except this time, not for some girl or because I don't like being the fat kid. I am doing it because I want the only tool I know I will always have to be in the best working condition possible. I spend countless hours optimizing my computer, tuning up my car and upgrading my electronics, but I spend very little time working on the one machine that I will have to use everyday until the day I die.\n\nAnyway, I'm ranting.

That's great - a ton of people really love what he does, and were truly upset at NBC's decision to mess shit up.\n\n**Here's my question**: How many of us can be held accountable? NBC intervened largely due to poor ratings - enough people just weren't watching his show. I'm wondering how many of the people (myself included) who are \"WITH COCO\" *actually* tuned in to watch the show regularly. You know, on TV.\n\nI love Conan O'Brien. I did some Tivo'ing of Late Night back in the day. I watched the last show last night, and I was really feeling it when he got a little choked up giving that last little speech before introducing Will Ferrel. BUT, I will say that it has been a looong time since I actually sat down in the front of the TV to watch The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.\n\nIt's a sad thing. I think that even though there were so many people who were/are With Coco, not nearly enough of them did what matters most - watching him regularly, giving him the ratings he deserves. Is it because he attracts more of a geeky crowd, and geeks seem to be more drawn surfing the internet than watching TV? Perhaps. And perhaps even if all of the supporters cared enough to watch the show regularly, it still wouldn't have been good enough for NBC. Either way, I think it's time for some reflection.\nTL;DR:"}

We broke up in 2012 when we were in a 1 year and 3 month relationship. We have been getting close to each other again recently. It has gotten up to the point where we started saying that we love each other. I should also mention that we live in different states so we communicate through texting a lot.  \n\n   So today we had a situation where we started arguing a bit. It got up to the point where he asked if we wanted to break up. The problem is, we never made it official that we were dating again. We did flirt often and tell each other that we love each other but neither of us made it clear that we were dating. \n\nWhen he said that, I got confused because I never knew that he thought we were in a relationship. I told him that I didn't know that and he became very upset. I asked him when he started believing that we were in a relationship and he said that he thought we were when I told him I loved him. \n\nThe thing is, I told started telling him I loved him at least 2 months ago. But just last week we were texting like usual and he said, \"I really want you to be my girlfriend but I've been really lonely and sad lately\". To me, that made me believe even more that we were not dating. I thought that he was basically saying that he wants me to be his girlfriend but he is unsure yet. \n\nWas it wrong for me to believe that we were not dating? Does there have to be an official date in a relationship? Any advice you can give as well would help. Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

Things were amazing and I met his family within about a month and a half of dating. Met his friends before that. \n\nAnyway, for the past few weeks / months, I've felt less important to him. He's been stressed with work stuff and so I did my best to be understanding and give him space. But I finally had to tell him that I no longer felt all that special to him, and that I felt as though he prioritized his friends over me sometimes. We see each other about 2-3 times a week, but we typically just have sleepovers and watch TV or movies. No real 'date nights'. I also want to mention that I do a lot of sweet little things for him, picking up little treats or gifts for him, and I don't get that in return. \n\nSo I bring these feelings up to him and he says that he's too stressed trying to make everyone happy and he doesn't really offer any solutions. I used 'I'  statements, not 'you' statements and tried to focus on working together to get back to being secure and feeling cared for. I should note, we haven't said any 'I love you's. \n\nHe came out and told me he was a commitmentphobe, and said he was sorry but didn't really resolve to try anything and didn't really explain. He did say he felt pressure from his brother getting married this summer and wouldn't be ready for that anytime soon. Which is fine, I haven't forced any talks about that stuff. \n\nWhat do I do? I need to meet my own needs, and I don't like feeling insecure in an 8 month old relationship. Everything was so easy at first and I'm willing to work on things, but he admits to being introverted and emotionally distant and says that that's just how he is.\nTL;DR:"}

As the years went on our friendship only got stronger and as it got stronger we talked about things closer to us than we would most. Things that troubled her (depression, self harm), and things that troubled me (Anxiety, Low self esteem). And we would do our best to help each other through it, The issues would come and go and when they came, we would help each other.\n\nAnd this was always the case up until recently. Things got worse in my life, much worse (About 1.5 months ago). And I spoke to her of things I had never to anyone before (Depression, Compulsive lying and Addictions). At the same time, she was still struggling with things, and that is where it all starts to get worse.\nSince then a rift has begun to appear, She has been pushing away from me and not talking to me. And every attempt to talk to her, even on a non personal level just would get shot down.\nIt only got worse as the last time I talked to her, she just told me essentially to leave her alone, not to talk to her in person or online or anything. She doesn't want to be friends anymore and doesn't want me in her life anymore.\n\nAnd here is my Questions.\nWhat do I do? Should I try to maintain this friendship (which is what I want to do) And how would I do that?\nDo I give it time, be blunt or just work my way up?\nAnd If I should just walk away. How do I deal with it?\nThe very thought of it puts a pain in my chest and Ruins any positive feeling, thought or emotion in my body.\nI just don't know how to handle any of this. It is all so new to me.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/travel\nTITLE: Disabled parent forgotten by Greyhound staff, is the compensation offered normal?\nPOST: Hello everyone, I apologize if this is the wrong sub to put this, but I figured that people who are well traveled would have a good insight into the situation. If there is a more appropriate sub to post this, a link would be greatly appreciated. \n\nMy mother (59) was scheduled to take a Greyhound bus from Phoenix, AZ to Albuquerque, NM today. She is physically disabled, and was put by greyhound staff into a separate waiting area (instead of having her wait in line) where they would retrieve her when the bus arrived to wheel her to the bus, assist her with getting on, and ensuring that she got on before other passengers/had access to the handicap seating at the front of the bus. \n\nA greyhound worker came and got her bags to be loaded on the bus, and said she would be returning to get my mother when the bus was ready to load passengers. My mother went to the restroom (#1), and got a drink from a vending machine and returned to the same seating area. After a time (she had her phone off to conserve battery, so amount of time is unknown), she noticed through the glass that there were much fewer people in the station, so she went and asked if the bus was loading passengers already.\n\nTurns out that the bus had recently left, with her luggage, but without her. The staff spent some time trying to figure out what happened, then they found the employee who was supposed to return for my mom and she admitted to having forgotten that she was supposed to return for her. \n\nThey are putting her on the next bus that comes to Albuquerque, which departs almost 6 hours after her original bus did, and the only compensation they have offered her is a $7.50 food voucher. To us, that is completely unacceptable. Is this normal compensation for such a screw up? Her bus won't be getting here until 3am, so I'm unsure if there will be anyone available at the bus station to speak to about this when I pick her up, or if I should just call either Greyhound customer service or their \"Assistance for customers with disabilities\" number tomorrow.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [26 F] with my partner [28 M] of 5 years, splitting up on good terms; what to do about joint possessions?\nPOST: Hey guys,\n\nSo as the title says, my partner [28/m] and I [26/f] have decided to split up after 5 years together.  We are splitting on good terms (have just decided we're not a good romantic match) and will try to remain friends down the line.\n\nNow, he moved to my country when our relationship got serious a few years back, and he'll be moving back to his country in a couple months after he settles everything here.  \n\nAbout two years ago, we bought a car together for $9k.  My name is on the registration and not his, so the car is \"legally mine\".  But obviously, we both used the car - and we both split asking price, the insurance, and the registration fees evenly.  Because he is moving back home, he won't have access to the car anymore, and I am keeping it.  We bought it used, but it's in pretty good shape.  It still needs to be serviced, though.\n\nMy question is:  if he asks me for money to pay for his half of the car (which I think he might), how should I respond?  Do I give him the full $4.5k or less because the car has depreciated in the past 2 years?  Or do I say no because I'll have future costs with the car and he won't?\n\nFor paying:  I technically make a bit more than he was making and have been working for longer, so I am slightly better off financially.  He'll also have the costs of moving and buying a new car and be unemployed before finding a new job back in his country.\n\nFor not paying:  I still have university debt to pay off, whereas he does not.  He will be moving back in with his parents for a bit and he has enough saved to get by, so he is not in a desperate situation by any means.  He also won't need to pay insurance, servicing fees, or repairs on our (now my) car as it gets older.\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months and things have been going pretty smooth until recently.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, I'm to the point where I just don't want to be around her anymore. I've lost interest in things that I loved like partying, working out, and just doing insane things with friends. (Note: I am not the internet's version of a douche bag.)\n\nI had this thought in the back of my head for a while, but put it off until today when my friend confronted me and told me that he even noticed a change in me. \n\nAnother factor which is somewhat convincing me to break up with her is the summer job she picked up. She is going to be a life guard and work Sunday-Saturday from 9am-9pm with one random day off each week. When she starts this job, ill never have the chance to see her.\n\nNow with that in mind, we are also going to be attending different colleges this fall semester that are about 2 hours away.

I originally lived in Austin, TX, but a couple months ago, I moved to a different state to be with him. He lived in a small town, but it was a college town, so I figured I could live with him while I went to school and such.\n\nIt didn't turn out so well. I ended up breaking it off with him, because he turned out to be a slob, had anger management issues, and would constantly accuse me of being a whore and sleeping around. It was a severely toxic relationship. \n\nHe turned into one of those people who unwraps something, and just leaves the wrapper on the counter; and besides that, he was extremely immature and didn't know how to handle a relationship. He even, at one point, kicked me because he didn't like something I did. Like, kicked me. Hard. I broke up with him soon after.\n\nAfter I broke up with him, I remained in the small town for a month or so, and then I moved in with a friend, who had a place in a nearby but bigger city. \n\nEver since that happened, my friends (who still talked to him) informed me that he has been spreading rumours about me. He said that I was an actual prostitute, and had sold my body for money and \"rides\" (like to different places). He also said I cheated on him, and that I had diseases that I gave to him.

What happens when you start off with the only intention being friends, but later want a relationship?  Here is my scenario\n\nI was a really shy guy (still am), (at the time 16yo with no previous relationships etc) became friends with this girl. basically became best of friends (like hanging out 5 or so days a week hours on end). Maybe after 2 years of this, I had realized that I had started feeling differently about her, I started hoping for more of a dating type relationship (not necessarly physical, but maybe in the future). We would often go out to dinner, go see a movie, sit outside under the stars and talk, just the two of us. Generally more romantic situations) However I had never made the move. I had always got to a point where I would be thinking about asking her out on an actual date (kinda like making it official), but then decide against it I was so determined not to ruin our current relationship if she had felt differently, and so I never ended up asking her out. Relationship carried on, but I had essentially given up entirely on dating her.\n\nFast forward 4 more years, still friends (although not as close, she has a bf now who doesnt like me), I have moved on (been happily dating a girl for a year now)  Anyways. my question to you ladies, If you had found out that your best friend(or someone you are really close to) had asked you out and was interested in you, but you didnt feel the same way, would your view of that person change? would you change how you acted around them?\nTL;DR:"}

She has always been kinda \"new age friendly\", and this guy is a reiki master, does biomagnetism, the whole package, so she fell hard for him. They were pretty happy together, and 4 months into the relationship they decided to have a baby.\n \n\nIt was all pretty cool, he was always talking how now we were a family, that it was gonna be great to have a baby, yadda yadda yadda. Until last week, when, out of nowhere, he told her that he didn't loved her anymore and that he had a new girl. We were pretty shocked, and while my mom suspected the girl had a thing for him (they are co-workers, he's a teacher at a local highschool, and she saw them together a couple times while going to pick him up), she never thought he also had a thing for her. \n\nAfter the initial shock, we were expecting him to move out, but he had a talk with my mother and says it's best for the baby that he sticks around, in case he's needed for a run to the hospital (she has been passing out at least twice a month), and now my mother is confused, letting him stay for a couple days.\n\nSo here we are, the \"I can get you to the hospital\" thing is bullshit since she has plenty of friends and family to spend this month with, starting with me, but when I point this out to her she starts avoiding the subject, since she still loves him and hopes she can make him come back to her. So I would love to hear some objective opinions on the subject, because I think it's awful for her and the baby to be under this kind of pressure with the a--hole in the house, but who knows, I'm biased by the amount of hate I feel right now.\nTL;DR:"}

Michelle Obama, who happens to be the sister of our basketball coach, decided to be the keynote speaker for it. \n\nAt first, I thought this was really cool. All political beliefs aside, it was an opportunity to witness a figure from history make a speech on my behalf as a graduate. It's a 'once in a lifetime' kind of appeal. So I registered to walk for my graduation. I went to commencement last year, and found it wasn't all that bad and a pretty casual occasion. So I thought: Why not?\n\nNow it is a few days before commencement, and tons of new security regulations have been implemented (understandably). Because of this, the format of graduation has changed to what is essentially volunteered detainment until the actual ceremony in order for graduates to not get snuck any kinda weapons or... something to the effect of offensive to the wife of the president.\n\nTo top it off, I have met people who have no reason to go to the ceremony now, but are going simply for the excuse of seeing her. They had no reason to go, no graduates to see, they're just there to watch her speech. In short, a ceremony that is all about graduation is now all about Michelle Obama.\n\nSo I guess my question is something like this: Is it even worth going to this? I don't think I'll get any enjoyment out of it on my own. It was meant for my family, but my dad backed out and my grandmother can't make it. So family isn't really going to be an issue. In fact, the only one who would go to see me is my GF, and she's kinda indifferent. She'll only go if I go. But, it's commencement. You only graduate a select few times in your life.

I called his phone again yesterday and got the same result.\n\nThe problem is, he doesn't really use social media, and I don't know how to contact any of his friends or family. I did find his old facebook profile that he doesn't use anymore, but it's got a lot of privacy settings, so I couldn't see many friends of his. I tried adding who I could see so I could ask them if they know anything or what's up, but none of them have accepted me, so I'm pretty limited here.\n\nI would also like to add we haven't fought, had any disagreements or much of any drama at all.\nTL;DR:"}

You read that correctly. 21 here. \n\nWent over to my mom's yesterday morning. She convinced me to stay until Sunday morning. I don't want to listen to the guilt trips, so I stayed. \nNow, my mom had a friend over late evening. My brother and I dislike this friend of hers so we just lock ourselves in our respective rooms. Headphones on, Netflix and Spotify streaming. Same for my brother but replace Netflix with CS: GO and telling 12 year olds he f*cked their mom. My mom knows this and that she 99.9% won't see us for the evening. \n\nHere is where I went wrong: I was still up around 2 a.m. watching Sons of Anarchy. I decided to go get a refill on my drink.\nNow, to give some context: my father passed away a few years ago. My mother has only had maybe one serious boyfriend that we know of since then. And has taken various trips, on her own, supposedly. Let's continue. \n \nAfter making it down the stairs, I take a few more steps and end up in the kitchen. Had I taken a few more steps, I'd have ended up in the living room. However, it's all open-plan so the kitchen is facing part of the living room. I see my 43 year old mother going down on her friend. I mean, really going to town guys. Nope'd the hell out of there with an awkward seal expression on my face. \nI don't think either of them saw me because of my position, the lighting and...their position, so I guess it makes it easier that she doesn't know that I know. But I know...and I saw. She was wondering why I'd left so quickly this morning.\nTL;DR:"}

I have found two girls from Paris who are in a band and have a visa to be in the US for three years. They are not allowed to work, their visas only allow them to play music. They do make money from gigs but it's not necessarily steady or provable. Their parents will be paying the rent by sending the girls the money every month and the girls will pay me.\n\nI am not necessarily concerned about them not paying rent, but I want to make sure I am legally covered in case they do not pay.\n\nMy first question is regarding how to word the lease. Each tenant will have a separate lease for a single bedroom. I already have a standard lease that I pulled from the internet and modified to fit my situation. Should I just include each tenant's parents in the \"tenant\" line, with joint and several liability? The parents live in Paris so I'm not worried about them trying to access or live in the house.\n\nThe second question is regarding legal options if rent payments stop coming in. The girls are not US citizens, they are here on a visa, and the parents live in Paris. If rent stops coming in, do I just give them 30 days notice to vacate and then start eviction process if payments aren't made?\nTL;DR:"}

As an example, disagreements tend to come when we have plans to meet up, and she says she can't because she has to go clean her room. Unfortunately we're both really busy, and probably wouldn't be able to meet up for another week so I suggest (not angrily) that she could clean her room a time other than when we had agreed to meet up. She then gets really mad, saying I'm pressuring her and usually there's nothing I can do/say to change her mind. A couple times I've gotten fed up and very mad, and it's convinced her, but I don't want to make her do things, at the same time, we need to have more seriousness about commitments to plans.\n\nI know there's underlying issues with her family who pressure her a lot, and her mother always wants her to be home when she's not at work. Her family is Indian and in a very tightly knit community and I'm white. They don't know about me because my girlfriend thinks they'll hate me because I'm not from their community and lock her up in the house if she tells them.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, I know there's a lot of pressure on her, I want to be able to help her to help loosen up her parents but it's hard because they're very oppressive and controlling and I can't do anything indirectly. Her mother uses guilt a lot to make her do things. She'll sometimes cry for hours when my girlfriend won't do something she wants her to, telling her she's putting her in so much pain and how could she be so negligent of her own parents and family. Usually it's for something as simple as my girlfriend wanting to go visit another city for the weekend.

I really like her and all, but I'm not ready and I don't know if I'll ever be ready. I'm worried that moving in together is too big of a step for us because I don't see myself with her long term.

I love our relationship and we have so much fun together, but I know it will eventually end because she has some qualities I don't find suitable for a lifetime commitment. For example, she's not very sociable, she's not ahead in her career, and sometimes she can be a bit overly critical of what I'm doing. There's other things too, but I won't go into everything. \n\nI still love her a lot and really admire a lot of things about her and love spending time with her. I never thought our relationship would even last this long, but we honestly are great as a couple (we never fight), I'm just sure if we made it serious and lived together we wouldn't be the same couple.

Her injury is a cervical radiculopathy that occurred when a patient (who later died) whacked her in the head while she was assisting in turning the patient.  \n\nThe employer is self-insured, so worker's compensation laws don't really seem to apply here.  At the time of the injury, they gave her 10 days to review and sign an agreement to hold harmless.  The agreement was that they would provide all necessary care so long as we didn't sue them.  We signed that waiver, worried that she wouldn't get necessary treatment.\n\nUnfortunately, there were several delays that they caused in treating her that we believe made her injury worse.  They treated her with some sort of steroid injections, but that was months after the injury.  As time went on and the injury didn't heal, they had her do several things such as maximum medical improvement exercises that we feel could have worsened the injury.\n\nWe have spoken to several attorneys and none will take the case since the waiver has never been successfully \"penetrated\".  As a part of a final settlement, they want her to sign an additional agreement to never sue.  One lawyer told us that we should be happy to accept any settlement at this point since we signed the first waiver.\n\nHere is a key takeway for anyone who ever confronts this situation: **do not sign anything** until after you have had a lawyer review it.  Even if they threaten termination, let them fire you and lawyer up!\n\nHas anybody ever experienced anything similar?\nTL;DR:"}

We had a fight and didn't talk for about two days. I texted her saying to \"pack up my things, and I'll do the same with your stuff\" which I know I shouldn't have done, but I needed to know she wanted to work with me and would fight for us. I was hoping she would fight for it not to end but she just got mad and said \"wow ok\". Things were fine between us before but her running from fights we would have scared the shit out of me. I apologized two days after and said I didn't mean it and wanted to be together. She wouldn't listen, blamed me for breaking up with her with the typical \"you did this, not me\" and wouldn't talk to me. Then she texted me to drop my stuff off, and right after said something like \"hope you show the next girl you date that you actually care about her\".

Why don't we start doing a symbolic gesture in the name of peace? If we can do it for love, nature, spirit, motherhood, gratitude, it only seems fair enough to do it for peace as well. It is clear that traditions matter to everyone and that people go to great lengths to keep them. Traditions are found in every culture, every household and every small or big group of people. Traditions bring peace, in one way or another in people's lives.\n\n[Peace One Day] is a non-profit organization with the objective to raise awareness of The International Day of Peace (21 September) and is asking everyone to take part in the largest movement of global reduction of violence and conflict. They also launched an invitation to come up with an idea that will help raising awareness for Peace Day and make it impossible for anyone to ignore it. In response to their invitation I came up with the [POD Candle] project. For this project I created [this] website.\n\nThe idea is that you bring a new tradition in your life by giving or lighting a special candle in honor of Peace Day. What makes the POD Candle different from a regular candle is that it contains a gift or a message inside it. You can make your own Peace Day candle by following the guide I posted [here] I chose the candle as a symbol because it is an universal, cross cultural symbol that has the power to bring consolation, inspiration and peace of mind. Lighting a candle has multiple meanings, all in tune with what Peace Day is all about: from meditative thought, expression of support, memorials to prayers. Candles have a way to bring serenity, focus and comfort in the minds and the lives of people around them.\nTL;DR:"}

We quickly fell for each other and I was the first to say \"I love you\" about 3 months into the relationship. He said it back right away. Due to timing issues, we broke up two months later. During our break-up, I asked if he had ever loved me, and he said, \"I don't know, maybe I just got caught up in the moment. I really care about you, though.\"\n\nWe were on-and-off for a few months, but I was too scared to use the word \"love\" again. On Valentine's Day this year, he started reaching out to me again to start the relationship. He wrote me a long, romantic letter explaining why I was so important to him and why he wanted to be in a relationship, and signed it \"love.\" We've been together for about two months again now and I'm really happy. I can definitely see us having a happy future together, and that excites me. \n\nI want to tell him I love him, but I'm afraid to be the first one to say it again. I think he does love me, but he's not great at expressing himself or talking about emotions -- he's been able to bring up the subject of marriage and kids, but the word \"love\" scares him off, I think. \n\nShould I bring it up? If so, how?\nTL;DR:"}

I was raised in a lower middle-class home and am incredibly grateful for the opportunities that I have been provided thus far in life. \n\nI was lucky enough to receive a full paid scholarship to a Canadian university of my choice that included a stipend for living expenses. Through three of my years, I also worked a job that covered the cost of room and board allowing me to bank the $9000 stipend each year. Unfortunately, because money wasn't tight, I didn't save very much and instead spent most of my surplus traveling during the summers (which I'm not regretting, to be frank). In addition, my parents and I were dedicated to putting away money for college throughout my life, so I have a fund that will be paying out about $10500 this year. \n\nAfter a dental surgery I need to pay for, I should have approximately $18000 net left for my final year with the scholarship and the fund combined. I intend to move my assets to the US over the next few years (I'm a dual citizen) to enroll in an expensive MBA program (100k per year before financial aid) and work on a start up with a buddy.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Need Advice on my Cellulite Struggle! :(\nPOST: Hi all!  I hope this is the right place to post.  You guys have kept me motivated during my weight loss journey so far and are always so helpful!\n\nI made the conscious decision to lose weight a little over a year and a half ago.  My starting weight was 180lbs. at 5'8\" tall.  Nothing extreme, but enough that I felt sluggish and self conscious and was bordering on plus-size clothing.  The real reason that got me started, though, was how depressed I would get whenever I tried on a swimsuit or shorts.  Since I was little, my thighs have always been big.  I don't know if it's always been there, but around age 13 I started to notice a major amount of cellulite on the front and sides of my thighs (interestingly enough, the back of my legs and butt have little to none).  When I decided to lose weight, I was particularly excited about getting rid of the chunky look and finally getting some smooth legs.\n\nWell, many months later and 35 lbs down, I am now weighing in at 145.  I wear a size 8, the smallest I've ever been.  I feel better, clothes fit me, I have more energy... It's great, except that the cellulite hasn't changed.  If anything, it looks weirder because it's all over the legs of a relatively slim person now.\n\nHave any of you gotten rid of cellulite in that area?  Am I doing something wrong?  Any tips or tricks?  Any input would be so appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

Even when I follow exact instructions and somehow clear the entire (growing) workload every single day, I'm asked over and over if I have ever completed it, no matter HOW easily verifiable it is without asking. Sometimes I follow instructions exactly, but then get chastised when I failed to somehow figure out missing puzzle pieces of information that I needed to give bad boss what he/she actually wanted. Small, petty details are held against me and used as justification for preventing me to do bigger tasks that I'm capable of doing, know how to do, was HIRED to do, and am LICENSED to do.\n\nI'm constantly slated as a failure and incompetent because I get stuck with overwhelming expectations that are changing and conflicting on a daily basis. My peers are not held to those standards, and are still somehow held in esteem. \n\nI'm accused constantly of ALWAYS doing something wrong and NEVER doing something right. Any one error that I've made somehow becomes a theme for every other situation with everyone else in the department, even if they never witnessed it. No matter what problem I'm troubleshooting, everyone's first question becomes, \"Well did you do (*insert one mistake that happened two months ago*)?\"\n\nI'm somehow disrespectful no matter what I say, and even if I say nothing at all. My only option at this point seems to be own whatever I'm accused of (no matter how grossly inaccurate or unfair), apologize, and bow my head. Defending myself and correcting the record of what I actually typed, did, or said is taken as insubordination. Even if I choose silence and submission, I'm bombarded with lies that are used against me to show how \"incompetent\" I am. I feel like I will be inevitably ousted. \n\nI have been unsuccessful with getting another job because of scarcity of local opportunities and not having enough job history in my new field. Am I just screwed, and should bow out with grace, dignity, and somewhat of my reputation left in tact?

Then, a few months later, she still talked to many other guys on whatsapp so I asked if we could read it together so we could talk about it. We did and it helped me cope with my fears because I saw it was pretty harmless chitchat now. However, with some guys she had sexual relationships before she knew me. I almost forgot to mention that none of these guys are male friends, just guys she knows from holidays, bars, friends.\n\nToday I saw on her phone that she still talks to other guys on Whatsapp and I saw incoming facebook messages of a guy she had sex with before me, this was also the guy I told her to stop flirting with.

We have worked hard at our relationship. After the magic and rainbows of a new thing we have created a sturdy foundation. We are the socially awkward, emotionally introverted and the life of the party, emotional loudmouth tandem, with me being the latter. If we had a super power it would be looking pretty fucking cute together. Just to reference, I have never cheated on a girlfriend but have been tempted so I can relate to the appeal. \n\nBackground on the question:\nMy girlfriend cheated on her then boyfriend with a coworker after dating for 6 months. We have talked about the incident and while I'm not incredibly fond of the infidelity, I can move forward in our relationship with trust in my heart. \n\nIssue:\nShe continued dating her ex for approximately a year after cheating on him and eventually left him for a relationship with me. I take more of an issue with the year of silence than the act itself. Cheating on your SO... I'm not happy but I can understand. Letting him live a lie for a year... Scares me. She's got the keys to the driver's side door of my heart... and she's been drinking. [I know that doesn't make sense but I said that to myself out loud like a gruff action hero and couldn't stop laughing, ha] This is someone I could build a life with, have a family and hold until we are old and leathery. In 8 months she has been nothing but wonderful and has my absolute trust, but I still wonder should she confess? Would it have a purpose? I guess what I really want to know is will she have the balls to tell me it's over if necessary or will she let me live a lie. Give me your life experience reddit. Ever cheat on a SO and tell them about it years later? Did it help you? Did it help your current SO? Any purpose at all?\nTL;DR:"}

He has a great, stable job and is building a future for himself here.

She has been very distant ever since.\nPOST: I've [m/25] been with my girlfriend [f/21] for almost three months and a couple of days ago had our first serious talk about what we want in the future. We discussed our shared interest in having children (eventually in the distant future) which was great, but the topic went to marriage where we hit a snag.\n\nI've never been interested in marriage. I'm not religious and I find the idea of marriage an old expensive concept where you show your love through a ring. I completely understand that to a lot of people marriage is more than that but for me I feel as if I can show my love and commitment for a person in many other ways. I don't need a ring for that.\n\nMy girlfriend has been the type of person who has wanted to get married since she was a young kid so hearing me say that made her upset. We didn't argue about it, hell, she even said she understood why I didn't want to get married and would never want me to do something against my will just to please her. She has been extremely level headed with the whole situation. \n\nSince then (roughly a week) she has been very distant in terms of communication, enthusiasm, and every other aspect of the relationship and its clear that its affecting her. My question is how do I deal with this? I hate not being able to give her what she wants. I can't go through with a marriage I don't want, even she knows that and I doubt she would want to if I said id do it just to make her happy. \n\nI feel the only logical option is to split up and let her find someone who will want to get married, or am I being silly? I know its not the biggest or most interesting post on this sub but I just want the best for her and need advice.\nTL;DR:"}

Sometimes I walked her home, because she lives extremely close to campus (we are in college), and I actually really enjoy walking her home because her stories are amusing and interesting.\n\nNow here's the thing, I don't know if I'm interested in her,-because she seems to be Aphrodite one day, and Medusa the other- neither if I have the slightest idea of her being interested in me. I never asked for her phone number, because if I do have a crush on her, I would never admit it. I figured that she is the type of person who would never admit it either. \n\nHere comes the kicker, I *probably* won't see her until next semester, unless if I start looking for her around campus (which is not too hard, *yes I am* ***that*** *guy*). And now I feel kind of disappointed that I didn't have her phone number or asked her out or to just hang out or whatever, and it won't be until next semester that I'll see her again. We are going to take a couple of classes together next semester.\n\nIf that's the case, which is probably 99.999% bound to happen, what do I do next semester? Because today, the day of the class' final, I saw her and now I can't stop thinking about this. How do I approach next year?\nTL;DR:"}

We're pretty close, and he works with me occasionally so it's good to keep track if he's on his way, etc. My parents saw this, and asked him to share his location with them. He reluctantly agreed.\n\nFast forward a few months later, this is now a big source of contention. Being a growing man, my brother wants his privacy and to be trusted. On the other hand, my parents like the feeling of knowing he's safe. Unfortunately, if my brother turns off his location, he is threatened with losing driving and phone privileges. My parents have said they won't abuse the privilege, but they will call him and ask him why he's at a certain location. Obviously these tools didn't exist when I was his age (i'm 28 now), and when I asked what my parents did when I was his age without these tools, they said \"we worried a lot more.\"\n\nHow do I convince my parents that this is doing more harm than good?

We started dating after we finished high school, and broke up about 3 months ago when we had separate extended trips planned. She broke up with me. And it sucks, alot, especially since she was my first love and its something I've wanted for years. I just have a few questions about what I should do since I've never been in this situation.\n\n1) I'm not over her. We've both been with other people but really no one compares to her. We hang out occasionally in groups naturally since we've been best friends for close to 6 years, but I feel like this is a situation where I should just not make any contact with her for a while. Is that unreasonable?\n\n2) Looking back, once the initial heartbreak of the break up wore off, I realized she was kind of shit to me.

But something in me still wants to be with her and I can't figure out why. Is that normal? Should I pursue it?\n\n3) Because of the distance we haven't really talked alot.

Is it a bad idea for me to initiate something in order for me to get a sense of closure or for me to express how I am feeling to her?\n\n4) Is it wrong to think that she doesn't \"deserve\" to currently be friends with me or for me to give her emotional support, even though I want to?\nTL;DR:"}

It's not a lethal rhythm (you don't typically die from it...sometimes from complications but a lot of people can live with it on medication) but my version of it just happened to suck a little extra than most cases. They tried cardioversion on me a few times in the ER (the thing where they shock you with the paddles to try to get you into a normal rhythm) and it didn't take, so they decided to schedule a cardiac ablation surgery. That's where they go into your heart with a catheter and burn or freeze the electrical conductors that are causing the problems. \n\nThe first one didn't take, so we had to do it again - anything to stop these attacks from happening every other day.

I know it sounds selfish of me to expect him to come up so I should explain that the course I'm doing right now isn't offered in his city, and any equivalent courses don't have the prestige of my university (the best in the [smallish] country).

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: How do you truly rid your house of fleas without using a bug bomb?\nPOST: My sister has two cats that used to have fleas and she would bring them over to my parents' house. She only stayed about two days and then went back to her own apartment. This happened about 3 times before I started noticing little bite marks on my legs when getting into bed. My bedroom was in the basement and had a carpet floor, but the shitty carpet that's all flat and rough because the people who had the house before us used it as a sewing room (old lady). Then I noticed that there were little black things crawling up my legs and biting me and realized that they were fleas. Fuck having hairy legs. The fuckers would crawl up my socks and bite right where the socks meet my shins. Fuck everything about them.\n\nAnyways, after about a week, enough was enough and I decided to move into the bedroom upstairs and leave that hell-hole alone. It's nice upstairs because its all hardwood flooring with the occasional rug here and there. I went back down the a flaming vengeance with this cheap-ass fabric flea spray and basically used up the whole bottle spraying down the shitty-ass carpet and couch and sides of the mattress, followed by a vacuuming. It seemed to work for a bit because when I walked in the room I didn't find any of the bastards that jumped on me. I still didn't trust the room so I still just stayed upstairs. Skip forward for a couple months and a few more visits from my sister and her cats and the place is now thriving with fleas again. The cats were even flea-free before the visit so there must've been some flea eggs hidden somewhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, the fleas are starting to invade the upstairs after I made a trip downstairs to the room for a second to grab something and came back up to find my socks and shins were infested with about 20 of the little FUCKING CUNTS. Sorry, I really hate fleas. So how the fuck do we get rid of them? I live in Canada so there aren't as many options as far as bug control goes (less sprays and no bug-bombs) which fucking sucks.\nTL;DR:"}

It worked all right--the occasional pimple here and there.\nA friend told me that I was overdoing it, that I was creating the problems I was trying to fix--that the benzol peroxide may be killing bacteria, but also drying out my face, which caused my skin to produce more oil.  She told me to stop all that, and maybe I'd break out, but then I'd clear up again, after my skin got used to not being dried out every day.\n\nSo I decided to experiment, and stopped doing all that crap--washing only with an apricot scrub.  For two weeks, my skin was doing fine.  Great, in fact--completely clear--better than before.\nAnd then: BREAKOUT.  It's geting worse and worse each day now, big, red ones spreading around my mouth.

We met online when I was about to give up on dating for a while, and we hit it off. Things are amazing and we care very much about each other, and have started to have small conversations about moving out together next year (March or April). We spend a lot of time together right now in an environment that would mimic living together already, but only for 3-5 days at a time.\n\nThe problem is our schedules. I work a typical 9-5, M-F job, but shes works Saturday thru Tuesday nights from 12pm to 10pm. She sleeps in, so I try to get up early so I can leave early from work (I have flexible hours so it works). The solution we worked out is that she ends up staying at my place for a few days at a time. I feel bad because she spends most of her day just waiting for me (and I've been in her position from my last relationship, waiting sucks). \n\nShe has netflix, she goes on my computer to kill time shopping. She does her nails. She makes lunch. She cleans even though I tell her she doesn't have to because it's my mess. But I feel bad that she spends her day just waiting for me. I know she's really bored because when I get home she just wants to spend time doing stuff right away, and I totally don't mind that. She doesn't have a ton of her stuff at my place, and I am trying to encourage her to bring whatever she wants to help kill the time.\n\nWhat I need are some ideas on how to make her days waiting for me to get home easier. I have my video games and my friends online. Whenever we are living together, it won't be bad for me because I'll have that to kill time. She doesn't have something like that currently.\n\nAny tips/suggestions/ideas would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Our kid is planned and we both mutually agreed that we wanted kids long before we started being serious. I'm ready to start a family and I've even taken up sewing lessons from Julie's mom. That was my idea-- infant's clothes are pricey considering they're going to grow out of it in literally 2 months. I've taken a ton of parenting classes with my wife. Our baby boy is healthy as any baby can be, we have about $100k in savings and we're earning about $160k together. Julie's mom is going to take care of our kid (who runs a daycare and we both trust). We live in a pretty good school district in a friendly neighborhood. Me and Julie still love each other a lot and we almost never fight. Everything that we can do is set and ready.\n\nBut I don't think I'm ready to be a dad. I still don't think it's enough. I'm worried that I'm going to fuck up my own kid since my dad left me when I was younger and my mom was distant. When I first started dating Julie I was immature, a brat and generally an irresponsible man child. I had to learn how to take care of her when she was sick while Jules just has this instinct. She's always caring while I was emotionally stunted before I got myself into therapy.\n\nPoint being, I feel like I'm going to fuck my kid up really bad. I know I should rely on my wife and just tell her but it all seems so natural to her. She's taking this all really well, and never mentioned that she was anxious. If I do tell her, I don't want her to think that I'm leaving her and the kid or anything like that. Is it even a big deal?\nTL;DR:"}

We are compatible in nearly every way and have eerily similar thoughts on almost any subject.\n\nAll that being said, we live 3 hours apart but talk constantly and see each other every weekend.  He has been offered a job in the city where I live, but, although the pay is more than he's ever made, it may not be enough to live on alone.  If he moved in and we split expenses, he would be able to start saving for an emergency fund.\n\nI was the one to come up with this plan, and he is somewhat in agreement.  Neither one of us are exactly sure if this is right though.  We are still getting to know each other and are very cautious about doing something so meaningful too soon.\n\nMy thought is this:  If he accepts the job, he gives a 2 week notice and we make plans for him to move in.  Set boundaries, decide how the bills will be split, and some other formalities.  We give it 1 month to see how things work out.  He may get into the job and hate it.  We may decide we aren't ready for this.  But a month should give us time to figure things out, and for him to find other arrangements.\n\nDoes this sound like a valid plan?  A one month trial period for us and for his job.  If one or both doesn't work out, neither of us will have made huge commitments and he could easily move back out.  Instead of being scared about \"would it work out?\", I think we are both scared about \"moving too quickly\".  Not because it doesn't feel right, but because we are cautious and probably concerned about what others (mostly our parents) will think.\nTL;DR:"}

I also didn't plug her electric toothbrush in when I was put all the stuff back on the counter (I did plug my father's in, though, and I hope she notices).

We're both 21 and I like her a lot but for the past two months I'm getting fed up with it.\n\nI'm a busy guy, I go to college as a full time student and work a full time job. I have zero days off during the week, I get about 3-4 hours a day late at night to myself and then I have to sleep so that I can wake up for work/school the next day. I like to use this time to see my friends occasionally or just relax and maybe watch a movie. I try to text her back when I'm able to but I'm usually in the middle of work or school. At night I call when I'm not completely stressed out, but like every normal human being, I don't feel like spending hours on the phone every night.\n\nLately she's been texting me constantly and even calling me when she knows I'm in the middle of class/work. If I don't respond within two hours she starts getting all dramatic saying \"I'm not done with this relationship yet, but if you are just say the word\" and other crap like that. She keeps telling me that I make her sad and all of this other stuff. It's frustrating as hell. Hearing all of this constantly prevents me from wanting to call her at night. I don't want to call and hear her rant on about how I don't care about her, why would I want to spend my night on the phone just to hear how terrible I am? I feel like I'm in a high school relationship with an emotionally immature girl, it's fucking tiring.\n\nI really need some advice on this now more than ever. Please help me out. Should I end it or try to keep going? This isn't the first time this has happened.\nTL;DR:"}

I hope you are all having a good Monday.\n\nAge: 28\nWeight: 245 lbs.\nHeight: 5'9\"\n\nMy complaint: so back towards the end of April this year I suffered a bad ankle sprain at work that left me unable to work for a couple of weeks. I was basically doing desk work and wasn't allowed to do much else. I weighed 185.\n\nI got laid off from that job and it was a slow summer finding work. A lot of time was spent eating cheap and unhealthy food while either applying to places online or driving to job fairs.\n\nFrom the period of April 28th to now I have gained 60 pounds. My anxiety is worse, I have moments of light headedness and panic, and I feel tired all the time. My girlfriend says while sleeping I get incredibly hot to the point of being drenched in sweat, but right now for instance I can't stop shivering.\n\nI have been eating relatively healthy and attempting to stay active during my period of unemployment. I walk the dogs around our neighborhood twice a day, and I lift weights in our spare bedroom. The weight and general feeling like utter shit ( excuse my language) still exist.\n\nMy mom has hypothyroidism, anxiety, and high blood pressure. The last time I checked my BP it was 136/79. I feel like I'm going down the same road she is as far as health problems, and this is all started happening to her around the same age.\nTL;DR:"}

Last night was no different than any night, sometimes tempers run high, sometimes jokes are made, but at the end of the night, we're all still friends.\n\nSo basically at the end of the night I ask for a drink from the cocktail waitress, she asks the bartender who says no (we are entitled to one shift drink after work as per rules set by the owner, off the clock of course). The bartender then has a chat with me, saying that I *always* ask for my drink from her (which isn't true in the least). Then she wants to \"talk outside\" but I just \"a goddamn margarita\" so she walks away, brings me one, set it down roughly and walks away again. 5 minutes later the cocktail waitress comes up to me asking why the bartender is crying. I didn't know, and at that point, I was too afraid to ask. So I finish my drink and leave.\n\nToday I get sit down by the general manager (who witnessed everything that happened last night and never got involved because from both his and my standpoint, all I had done was ask for my drink and she was beating around the bush not wanting to give it to me). He informs me that the bartender, in her crying, emotional state, called the owner at home late last night and told him her side of the story, to which he then brewed on all night. I'm now getting my hours cut back because of this, and not shifts that might coincide with her, I still will be working with her, but arbitrary shifts here and there.\n\nFinally at the end of tonight I get the answer I was looking for, she was having a hard time getting medication covered from the insurance company or something, and because of that her biochemistry was out of whack, and me asking the other girl for a drink instead of her (which again makes no sense, I ask whoever is most convenient) was enough to throw her over the edge and start crying, call the owner, etc.\nTL;DR:"}

My mom is a good mom to him, and of course I treat him well, alone with my fianc\u00e9 who loves him to death. Well my grandmother(which is my mom's mother) my aunt alone with everyone else treats him like pure black sheep. I can think of a lot of examples of how he gets treated like it, but the one that comes to mind, which has been most recent is that him and two of my  cousins  were at a birthday party of another cousin, my grandmother was also there. She gave my two cousins and hug and says \"these are my babies\" while my brother is staring around and didn't give a hug at all. She doesn't acknowledge my brother is even her grandson and hasn't since he was born. My Aunt also treats him like crap, I can think of tons of examples of how she treats him like a black sheep as well. Not only do they treat my brother like crap, they treat my mom like crap as well. They lie to her, come to the house starting fights with her, and talk down to her like a dog. Yet, she forgives them and takes my brother to family dinners and I don't go because of the drama. Mainly how they treat my brother. I have an 9 month old little boy who they always want to see and I hardly take him around them. However, My mom always ask if they can see my baby. I don't understand on how it doesn't bother her because of how they are hell bent on seeing my son, and NEVER gave a damn about hers. It gets even worse, He has a dead beat for a dad with no father figure except my fianc\u00e9 who treats him like a son.\nTL;DR:"}

It's been a long day and I'm pretty mixed up about the things that are going on.\n\nI have been dating this guy for almost two years, there have been some challenges along the way but overall we have a good relationship and I'm happy with him. Recently it came up that my boyfriend has a tumblr, I had no problems with this and didn't even bother to find out any information on it because he mentioned it being used as a sort of journal that he didn't have any followers on. Yesterday I learned that he has one female friend who he is following and who is following him. This girl I have no problems with, they met because the friend dated a good friend of his for a long time. \n\nThe issue I'm having is that this girl is someone who actively post nudes on this tumblr. He has a facebook or as he calls it a \"fakebook\", that he's come up with a number of excuses to not at me on, but she is there as well. They text often and hang out on a one on one basis. He claims that it's an innocent friendship, that he's not interested in her and only sees her as his friend's girlfriend(they broke up a few months ago) and from other friends opinion it seems that she is just not attracted to him. He says that the issue is that I don't trust him. I do overall, but they're closeness makes me feel uncomfortable. We tried to talk things over last night, but it ended in a arugment.\n\n I don't know what to do and I need some advice. I don't care if they hang out, but if it involves anything that impairs their judgements(they both smoke and drink often) I have an issue and the tumblr thing really bothers me because of how often she post nudes on it. He says that that's just how she's always been and it doesn't mean anything.  Opinions please?\nTL;DR:"}

But she won't take \"I'm trying to sleep, I have to be up early\" as an excuse, she'll just keep messaging me about her problems until I reply.

I met him whilst volunteering abroad over the summer, and we were together for a month. We had such an amazing time together, being with him really helped me to get over a horrible break-up, although I figured it was just a holiday romance and didn't expect anything to come of it when I went home. I'm British and he lives in Denmark.\n\nHowever I've been in touch with him since I got home at the beginning of August until now. We talk a lot, sometimes in an \"intimate\" way. I am studying abroad this year, and he has asked me to go and visit him in Denmark, which I'm doing in a few weeks' time. I am really excited about seeing him, especially in the midst of everything new and living in a foreign country, having to speak a language I'm rubbish at etc. \n\nI'm just scared that I'm getting myself more emotionally invested in him than he is in me. I don't know if he just sees me as a long-distance fuck buddy. We haven't talked about being in a \"relationship\" or anything. I've got 2 more years before I graduate, so if we did end up in a relationship it would be 2 years of long-distance.\n\nI really like him. He is such a gentleman; he is sweet and funny and caring. But I don't know whether all that would change being in a relationship with him where we've never had a basis of being together in the same place for a long period of time. So when I go and visit him, I don't really know how I should act. Am I in a relationship with him? If he suggests an LDR I'm guessing he wants to be with me, so I guess I should say yes? And if he doesn't suggest anything and just leaves it how it is at the moment should I just assume that means he doesn't want anything? I have low expectations because although I think we'd have a chance if we lived in the same place, I don't want him to feel like he has to commit to someone who lives far away.\nTL;DR:"}

He already had issues with my past( I had more sexual and relationship experience than him) and I fear telling him I may not be 100% over my ex may make him never trust another girl again.

He managed to find a job at a coffee shop.  This is not inherently a problem.\n\nThe problem is, in my and much of my family's eyes, that he has absolutely no ambition.  The family is wealthy and he is comfortable, but he's a virgin with no social life.  I really don't think I've ever met anyone else with absolutely no goals or wants beyond the immediate (porn, weed, food, etc).\n\nOur folks divorced when he was like 11ish; it hit him hard and for years asked for them to reunite for his birthday.  He is 23 in a few weeks and he still likes all the same stuff he did at that age, pokemon and power rangers and stuff.  He spends all his time in his room watching that stuff on youtube, or warcraft, or whatever.  One time I saw his iphone's pictures and most of them were anime porn.\n\nThere have been times where he's seemed rather intelligent, but mostly not (the rest of the family is pretty smart so he's an anomaly).  In a way there is no problem, as he seems content.  My wife thinks he's depressed but he refuses therapy.  He could probably live at my mom's house forever like this, which again is not terrible as some people are starving, but it just seems like he should be aiming for more.\nTL;DR:"}

So every-time I am there, I see this same homeless guy sitting on the bench. So this past weekend, it was a little cold outside in the bay area so I decided to ask if this guy was hungry and if he would like a meal (this way he can be warm while eating, and get a free meal too). So I took him to BK around the table and treated him to lunch and a meal to go. While both of us where eating away, I decided to ask him how he ended up in this lifestyle. He informed me that it was due to series of bad-luck; starting with his start-up business failing, his wife divorcing cause of this because he wasn't financially secure and taking what he had, and credit card debt after all this.\n\nSo after the meal, we both departed our different ways. While driving back home, I started to realize that most homeless people I encountered were men than women. The reason I came up for this is, most women can marry a guy and become financially stable again, but for us guys, its different.\n\nHave you ever talked to a homeless guy and asked him how he ended up the way he did?\nTL;DR:"}

We never really talked to each other but I think she is really good looking and she is really nice. Back then I was a bit of a coward and didn't want to make things awkward. However, since we graduated last year I haven't had any contact with her at all but I've been thinking about her on and off ever since.\n\nA couple of months ago she appeared in a dream I had and when I woke up it felt good and I decided that I should ask her out which I did. We went on a date where I learned that she is going backpacking for two months. We have been on three dates and we are going on another one soon and I honestly feel like I want to get her interested in me (Unless she already are) but not get into a relationship with her when she is just about to leave. It feels as if it would be some what douchy to try and do that. Simply put I want her to remember me when she gets back.\n\nThe tricky part here seems to be that I don't really want to go all out because I feel that she should be free of as much responsibility as possible. I think she should be able to do whatever she likes whilst backpacking.\n\nHow do I get her to be interested in me so that it could become a relationship when she gets back but not right now (unless she wants a relationship now but I doubt it)?

We met online about 4 months ago, and have been seeing a *lot* of each other since. We spend (on average) 5 nights a week together. She sleeps over - but here's where things get weird (at least from my perspective). Anything remotely sexual is pretty quickly shut down. I've asked verbally a couple of times while making out, attempted to gradually ramp into it 'spontaneously', but she'll always stiffen up and back off. \n\nShe rarely initiates physical contact, and is quick to break off. When I ask her about it. She mumbles that she has a really hard time letting people get close to her, and mentally checks out. \nThis is *fine*, but after four months I'm a little surprised at the degree of resistance. \n\nI'm not sure what to do given that she won't communicate about it and I feel like it's been a significant amount of time. On paper, I think it looks like she's using me for food, but I'm pretty sure that's not it. I have a feeling this may just be her personality, and that we're not gonna last. I figured I should talk to someone before I just gave up and dumped her though. To be clear, I'm not asking 'how can I get this girl to fuck me', I'm more concerned that she's unwilling to even verbally open up.\nTL;DR:"}

Since then my mom has only made a related comment like one time(about the ring fh had designed for me) and my dad has literally not mentioned a single thing related to it at all. My parents have been separated for many years and are amicable so I don't know that it's necessarily about that.  Perhaps it's just that it's so far out and we have literally nothing concrete planned yet, but it seems like lots of people have family that are really happy for them.

I get that they are an ally, but if (as an example) the UK decided that their piece of northern Ireland wasn't big enough and just started setting up shop south of the area internationally recognized as theirs, we (along with the rest of the world) would protest.

Is it because the Pat Robertson types think it will cause the end of the world?\n\nI also understand that there are people who lob homemade bombs into Israel, which is not okay and Israel has every right to defend its people from this. However, it does not have the right to build settlements outside of its territory. The UN has procedures for border disputes, but this is not it. This is 2012.

I don't feel like I ended it the way it could have been but I feel like any other way would have resulted in a far different outcome. \n\nI really don't know what to do guys or how to even move on from this :( This is the first time to happen to me and I read other peoples posts about this but this feel so much more different because its actually happening to me and not someone else.\n\nWhat do I do??? :(\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/askwomenadvice\nTITLE: Is this romantic or creepy?\nPOST: So there's a friend I have from when both us were doing some travelling abroad, I'm 24 (male) and she's 20. We ended up going our own ways and ending up back in our respective countries, and we've kept in touch through Facebook since. \n\nLast week I was on holiday with friends in her city, so she came and met me for a day. We did lots of touristy stuff, and there was a moment she found funny when I got the wrong end of the stick because I can't speak the language and ended up accidently buying a bunch of tacky postcards from a guy on the street. She then came back to the flat and hung out with me and six friends, before we all had a night out.\n\nI guess I always liked her a bit, but this whole thing made me realise what an idiot I've been not to see how perfect she is for me. We have so much in common, and talking to her is so easy. I think she might feel the same (her staying out all night with 7 drunk guys on a work night possibly points to that), but for varying reasons nothing happened. For starters we're both noticeably self conscious and nervy at times, although in a weird way that adds to her appeal.\n\nEven though we live in different cities I want to tell her how I'm feeling, but pouring my heart out into a Facebook message feels like a rubbish idea. My thought was to send her one of those postcards I accidently bought that explains everything. The problem is if I ask for her address the surprise is ruined, which leaves her work. I'm hesitant because she never directly said where it was, but I worked it out through various things she said to me.\n\nThe last thing I want is to make her feel uncomfortable by sending post to a workplace in a foreign city that I never directly got given the location of, but I also can't stew on this one. If you have any advice or just want to call me a neurotic weirdo feel free. Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

They didn't stay together long and she started dating her current ex. They lived together for about eight months and I was good friends with both of them at the time. Unfortunately, I always thought he wasn't treating her nearly as well as she treated him and that she could do much better. Since they broke up she's been having trouble with guys who just want her for sex and don't even treat her like a person. I always offered her hospitality and compassion, trying to be a good friend, and she was usually hesitant to accept.\n\n    Fast forward to last week, and we reveal to each other through texting that we are attracted to one another. She came over that night and we drank and smoked. We even slept in the same bed together and she kissed me and I kissed her back, but we didn't have sex. The next night we ate out after her work and she slept over again. She told me she liked me because I wasn't trying to get it out of her, and I just liked spending time with her. The only thing was she wasn't looking for a serious relationship, which was okay with me.\n\n    Yesterday, after we went out for the day, I had to leave to finish some school work. I tell her later that I had a good time, but she says I can't be what she expects me to be and that her ex was \"her person\" and she threw him away. She can hardly sleep out of fear of dreaming about him. I try to comfort her, but she listens to very little of it. She can't go back to her ex because of how badly their relationship ended and it depresses me to see her like this. I don't know if she feels this way because I reminded her of her ex or if she's just depressed (she does take medication as she often has panic attacks too). I don't know if I'm digging myself into a bigger hole by talking to her about it, but she doesn't have anyone else to turn to besides her parents. What else could I do to help her without losing a friend?\nTL;DR:"}

We've been seeing each other for over a year, and \"officially\" dating for 10 months. I know we're crazy about each other, and neither of us wants to break up. We've never really had any serious issues before. But suddenly, for the past couple weeks we've been fighting/arguing over just about everything. It seems like suddenly we cant be together without getting on each others nerves. And most of the time, its over stupid little things neither of use would usually get upset about. And I can't figure out why. I try to talk to her about it, but she just gets angry at me and tries to make everything my fault. So there's one problem.\n\nAnother big fight we're having is about this weekend. We were supposed to go out for dinner and see a movie on saturday. Last night she asked if we could change it to friday. I said yeah sure, but asked why. She told me another friend of hers (A male, who she knows I really dislike, wants to hang out. I hate him cause all he does is party/smoke weed, and tries to get her to do it. He's also such a dick to her. He won't talk to her for months, and then suddenly come out of nowhere and want to hang out with her again. Then he'll disappear again. Also, it kind of bothers me that he used to have a thing for her, and tried taking advantage of her once at a party.) So I tried bringing it up, and she got mad at me.\n\nMy question is, how do I get her to talk to me without getting mad? What are some suggestions I could make to help us figure this stuff out? I dont want to tell her she just can't hang out with him. I'm her boyfriend, but I can't tell her who she can/can't hang out with.\nTL;DR:"}

Suddenly, my cousin (let's call her Tumpy), who was born with down syndrome, walks into the room. I briefly chat with her and suddenly she picks a thumbtack off the ground! I snatch the thumbtack from her hand and tell her not to play with sharp objects. \n\nThen I had an idea! What would happen if Tumpy ate the thumbtack? This is where I truly fucked up. I told her that thumbtacks were actually just pointy candy and that she should try it. Tumpy trusted me enough to eat it and when she did, she emitted the loudest screech of pain I've ever heard in my life. She dragged her legs across the ground and charged into the other main living room area where everyone else was seated, knocking over lego structures that the kids made. Now she's screeching, the kids are crying, the pie is getting burned and everyone is frantic and freaking out. \n\nThat's when Tumpy opened her mouth and everyone sees a thumbtack stuck down the side of her throat. Using tweezers, they remove it, and lecture her not to eat sharp or unknown objects. Then, she pointed at me. Everyone's head turned to face me, glaringly. Tumpy shouted \"HE DIDHG TOLD EATTTTTUGHHHH\". I shrugged and told them I had no idea what she was indicating and they believed me. \n\nNow I feel really awful! Should I apologize to Tumpy? I'm starting to feel like convincing her to eat the thumbtack might be considered insensitive. Regardless, I fucked up. Help!\nTL;DR:"}

I am very close to my surviving grandmother, who is 94 years old and in good health.\n\nI met my father when he moved back to my state: I was about 7 years old. He had been working abroad, but had sent money to help care for me. I still lived with my grandparents but saw my father often - we had become best friends. But somehow, things had turned sexual. He groomed me for years while I wrestled with my conscience. In the end, I kept quiet because I didn't know how my grandmother and I would survive without his financial support. And I also knew that he felt guilty over the sexual abuse, so he was obliged to make a large investment in my elite undergraduate education. He tried to rape me, again, the night before I left home for 4 years in New England. And again the following summer when I came home to visit. I still carry a lot of guilt.\n\nIn college, I was eager to define my own sexuality. I was interested in boys. And I felt the need to somehow break the hold my father had on me. I made up my mind, lost my virginity, then quickly became involved with the man who is now my husband (26/m). I've confided in only him about my past and he is supportive.\n\nFor career-related reasons, my husband and I moved (back) to my hometown after college. To cut a long story short, my father is now my landlord, my grandmother occupies the spare bedroom, and I am increasingly anxious about all the things that go unsaid between all of us.

It was the most comfortable I've ever been with any human being and I wouldn't trade the experience I had with her for anything.\n\nAfter she went back to school I would try texting her and she wouldn't sound interested at all, and when I asked her about it she said she could never possibly give me what I want from a distance, and that talking to her would only hurt me more. At that point, I asked her if she really wanted to never see or talk to me again and she replied saying she doesn't think it would be a good idea, that she's moved on and thinks I should do the same. It was the last thing she ever said to me; and I felt more crushed than I've ever felt in my life. I spent a lot of nights crying over her and still not a day goes by where I don't think about her and get really upset about how she ended it with not even giving me a chance to hear me out or talk about it. \n\nIt's been 4 months, and I know I have to move on and respect what she wants even though my heart doesn't want to. I could write pages on how I feel about her, but I know in my mind that moving on really would be best for me. But I can't \"just move on\" or \"just forget about her\" like everyone always fucking tells me or simply delete the thoughts of her from my head or whatever... like seriously. I know that there is someone else out there for me in this world; but I don't think I have even seen any girl in 4 months that could compare to her level of beauty in my eyes.

We hid our relationship for a year and still work around her parents regularly. I don't think they hate me just what I represent as her long term partner. \n\nAlthough it was hard I came to terms with the fact that with her parents it would be a long process of slow, incremental, acceptance. \n\nShe's currently doing a semester on exchange in the UK (we live in Australia). She left right after New Year's and does not come back till July. \n\nThe one bright spot to this was us organising a holiday across Europe for 3 weeks in April. I booked my plane tickets today. I posted as much on Facebook in my excitement. \n\nHer brother and her parents duly saw this. My girlfriend was asked what was going on. Her mother especially was not happy, saying \"He's booked to Paris. What are you doing?\". \n\nShortly after her Dad informed her that her mother would be coming over for two weeks in April. \n\nCoincedentally overlapping with our holiday. \n\nEssentially she will be there to watch us. I doubt we'll go where we want, sleep in the same room, or do much of what we want to. \n\nI'm completely against such an idea. I'm not spending my savings to have a holiday with my girlfriend's mother. Unfortunately my girlfriend's reaction was \"At least we have one week\". She says she doesn't have a choice and does not really want to talk about it.\n\nHonestly, I'm devastated and I don't know what to do. This was meant to be our holiday. I don't want to leave her but I've let her know I can't do a holiday with her mother. I've compromised our entire relationship but here is the point where I need her to assert her independence as an adult. \n\nI'm so scared she won't.

My co-manager was even more grossed out than I was and they were so horrible we had to damage out the two pairs of shoes. In my defense a nylon would not have fit because she was a women size 11.5 and I don't get paid enough to see if people have clean feet or socks all day.

When we fight, it feels like the end. However, when we aren't arguing, we are strong, solid, and nothing can come between us.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Does anyone have a worse friends with benifits story? (NSFW)\nPOST: A throwaway for obvious reasons. I was friends with this girl from college and we became fuck buddies. We would essentially call eachother up every time we were in the mood and it worked quite well. Since school kept us busy, we didn't have to pursue real relationships and could have a release for stress and someone to talk to as well.\n\nAnyway. She has always been very hesitant about blowjobs. Just won't do them. So I called her up and she told me we couldn't have sex because she was on her period. I always just say \"okay...we'll talk later\" but I was thinking maybe I could get lucky with a blowjob. I basically asked her \"can we do other things\" and she said yes. I thought I was golden.\n\nI go over to her place after my last class and she suggests we take a shower. I have never had a blowjob in the shower so I agree. We are making out pretty hardcore and I think she is moving her hand down to get herself going when she pulls out a bloody tampon. Blood begins to drip down her leg and into the water and there came a foul odor of which I had never smelled before. I live in a frat house and I can deal with most odors but this was too much. I tried to hold it back but I started puking all over the shower. I had just eaten pizza unfortunately so it covered the entire bottom of the shower.\n\nI apolgize profusely and she asks why the hell I threw up in her shower. I told her I had no idea she was going to take out her tampon and it caught me off guard. She then replies \"well, how are we have to have sex when I am on my period of I have my tampon in?\" Then it all clicks. I felt so incredibly dumb. The only response I could think of was \"I thought you meant you were going to give me a blowjob.\" She then tells me to leave and I get out and walk back to my dorm in a towel carrying my clothes.\n\nNeedless to say she won't return my calls or Facebook messages.\n\nSo have at it reddit? Has anyone had it worse?\nTL;DR:"}

So yesterday I decided to flirt with one of my friend's best friends. And this morning upon walking into school the girl I was flirting with spills the beans about me flirting with her to our mutual friend. So our mutual friend shoots me a text saying be careful with *name withheld* don't hurt her. This seemed weird to me because I only flirted a little, and said she was attractive. After telling me a short story about what cute girl told my friend said she was surprised by it. Now here comes the fuck up.\n\nSo a little back story my friend was in a horrific traffic accident about a year ago. My friend was riding passenger in a car when they were driving home from a sporting event a man had parked his car on the side of the road, and as her mom drove past his truck he jumped out and killed himself. This man came through the windshield headfirst right into my friend's side of the car. Knocking her unconscious and putting her into a coma for about 10 hours. \n\nSo me being the forgetful person I am I think *I'll make a joke about shell shock* because she said she was shocked. So I said to her \"I bet you were shell shocked\". She said \"what?\" So I elaborate saying \"You know, PTSD?\" She replied \"I know because I have it...\" At that moment I felt like throwing my phone out the window in my classroom. And here is the icing on the cake. I had made that ill-fated joke right when she was leaving the school for her therapy for her PTSD. I feel like the worst person in the world.\nTL;DR:"}

Unbeknownst to me, when we started talking, she had been in a semi-casual relationship with a dude. Let's call him Gary. Incidentally (and again I did not find this out until a few weeks ago), I was one of the main reasons they broke up. Because she had started talking to me, they had gotten into a fight, and then broke up.\n\nKaren and Gary have been friends for about 6 years (ever since high school.) I am OK with that, it is absolutely reasonable for her to have friends outside our relationship. She has many other friends, but I would say Gary is probably in her top 5 friends. \n\nThe other night, Karen, Gary, and a couple other friends made plans to see a movie. However, somewhat last minute, the other \nfriends canceled on the movie. Karen texted me asking if I would be OK if she went to the movie with just Gary. I said that was fine, which it was. No big deal.\n\nToday, she texted me saying that she intends to bring Gary to a football game this Saturday. (This is also fine, I told her I had homework to do this weekend anyway.) She and her family are huge Ole Miss fans, and Gary has never been to a college football game, so she had promised him (back in the summer) that she would take him to a game this summer. I told her that I was OK with that. She also informed me that they will be staying at their lakehouse, which is only a few minutes from the Rebels stadium, her, Gary, and her family. \n\nAm I wrong to be somewhat upset about this? She did tell me that she has \"zero feelings for him.\" And said he's a family friend, and she'll be with her family the whole time so it's not just them two.\n\nI already told her I'd be OK with it. Which I feel is probably the correct position to have. But I'm still a little insecure about it, but I want to trust her.\nTL;DR:"}

I think about him from time to time, how we've helped each other over our own personal issues when we met each other, and feel nostalgic.\n\nSo anyway, I'm single now right, and although I'm not interested in dating or being with anyone, I met Jay, who is this full of life, super suave, artistic and deep individual through my best friend's school friends.\n\nWe become friends and he's asked me to hang out solo with him four times now, which I've done. Food and conversation. Casual. Laughter. We have a lot of the same ideals, goals, lifestyle.\n\nThe last time, we played video games in his apartment, and he gave me a stuffed toy. So we like each other, but I'm not sure in what way or if there's room for more.\n\nHe's intimidatingly sexy and smart, but I'm just afraid to go any further since I'm still feeling something for my ex. I'm wondering if maybe I'm just feeling a \"rebound\" type of thing. I don't have a concrete clue to what he expects, but I'm sure it's more than just friendship.  \n\nPlease advise.

However, my girlfriend of 5 years wants kids sooner than I do, mostly because she is worried about fertility (her mom had trouble concieving) and so if we waited till I was 35, she would be 37 and that would mean only 1 kid or maybe 2, definetely not 3 with the decline in fertility after 35. \n\nOur relationship is amazing otherwise but I'm wondering if this future issue is reason enough for us to break up now and save each other the heartache later. We love each other but I don't know that I'm willing to have kids earlier just because she is older, and although I've mentioned this to her before, she has spent some time thinking about it and said that her love for me right now is greater than the hypothetical kids in the future. It sucks because if I was in any other career I would probably want to have kdis way earlier but because I'm basically living in poverty until I'm done with residency, I'm not in a rush to have kids. \n\nSometimes I feel terrible thinking this but I wonder if I should let her go and find a girl younger so that I can have a family when I want to, and I guess she can find a guy that will let her have a family when she wants to. Sorry for rambling I'm just really confused right now and not sure what to do. I love this girl but I don't want to waste her time or my time if this causes us to eventually break up in the future anyways. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by buying xbox gift cards\nPOST: **This is my first time posting a tifu so tell me if I'm doing something wrong**\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nSo about 3 days ago, my mom and I went to the grocery store, and I remembered how xbox was doing their ultimate game sale, so i told my mom about it and she was alright with me buying some gift cards for it (40$ i got) so I did and downloaded the games that I've wanted and just started playing them normally. Also this was my stepdad's xbox(only account on there is his)and i thought he'd be fine with it.\nSo as I'm playing, my mom gets a call from my stepdad at work saying he found games bought on his account by email and my mom explained the whole situation(such as explaing how I'm paying for the games) and everything was fine. She just told me to ask her if i wanted to buy anything else with the money i had left and i said i would. \n\n**TIFU begins:**\n\nNext day, I'm just relaxing playing the games i bought, and then i see another game that i wanted and still had enough for, so i bought it even knowing i didn't even ask my mom because i thought my stepdad would just ignore it and not tell my mom, and also cause the game's normal price will go back soon. Soon to my surprise, that's exactly what happened and freaked out on me for not telling her and saying things like, \"That's not your xbox!\"(which i completely understand my part on that), & \"Your wasting his storage!\"(the size of the games combined weren't even close to filling up the system). So as of right now, I'm just waiting for when my stepdad gets home from work tonight and see how he reacts(he's doesn't talk much and is calm, but form my perspective, it seems like his job seems very stressful).\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: My usually bold dog gets scared of the wind on her daily walks.\nPOST: Hi, using a throw away account here, but in need of some real help with this one before I stop eating breakfast in order to afford a dog trainer. I rescued a 9mo old pit mix last June, who at the time was of course a real city hell hound on the leash. She's progressed quite a lot, but we've graduated from the Easy Walk harness to the Gentle Leader and at first had great success with her finally walking at a nice steady heel...until autumn set in and the winds began to steadily pick up. Last summer I broke her of her freak out of the rain by standing calmly in it myself and playing fetch off-leash in a closed area she was familiar with. Eventually she decided that the rain was not in fact daggers falling from heaven and I was not their accomplice, and while she still doesn't like the rain, she's no longer likely to bolt, growl, gnash, and fling herself all over the sidewalk when she's had enough. But she does still go wind crazy. Whether or not there are leaves or garbage in it, if the wind picks up she is suddenly terrified. I try to remain calm and reassure her without rewarding her or to give her a command to bring her attention to me. Sometimes I just pick a spot for us to loiter at for a while so we can calmly stand/sit in the wind. Of course when she's playing fetch or at the dog park she can't be bothered to care about the winds, but while walking it happens at least once each time and she's decided that pulling like a sled dog against the gentle leader isn't so bad after all-creating two problems from one fear. Since she's not generally exhibiting any anxious behavior I'm not sure how to work on this problem. Any suggestions ya'll can provide would be fantastic. Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

Things went a little further than I thought they would, and I ended up staying the night at her place both nights. We had sex.

We text all the time, but seeing as how I won't see her for a while, I feel it would be really easy to let it die down because of lack of interest or whatever.\n\nI'm afraid I might just be acting insecure, and that it'll be okay.

Two years ago I started dating a friend [25M]. We dated for six months and broke up a year and a half ago, though we've remained good friends. We have a large number of mutual friends, which probably helped - we couldn't avoid each other! \n\nThere is a mutual friend who I am interested in [M28]. I approached my ex basically asking him if he would be OK with me approaching our mutual friend romantically, and he said it would make him very uncomfortable. I respected this and didn't say anything. It gets a little complicated because I made an /r4r post without my face that this mutual friend replied to. We actually flirted a bit before I realized who he was, I told him who I was to be honest, and we later had a conversation essentially saying that while there was mutual attraction it would hurt my ex if we tried anything. \n\nAll of this is OK, though I have to admit slightly resenting my ex for setting these boundaries when we dated so briefly. At the same time, I value our friendship. \n\nHowever, I'm trying to move on. I'm dating someone new non-exclusively and while it's not true love, we have fun. Recently, *another* mutual friend and I have been having sparks and I want to see where it could go. I'm concerned about my ex however... I haven't talked to him about whether he'd be OK with me and this *other* mutual friend yet. \n\nI guess as I was thinking about all this, I became concerned that I am letting an ex dictate my dating life. Is this unhealthy? Or is this within the bounds of a normal friendship with someone you've dated in the past? I don't want to hurt my friend, but I don't want him using our past romance to control me either. I haven't stayed friends with many exes, let alone someone who is so enmeshed in my friend groups.

Both young and starting careers, don't want to break up.\nPOST: We are both in our early twenties (older than 21). I'm about to graduate finally, and he is trying to get a job that is long-term instead of temporary. We are currently living where we don't want to live long-term, and we are very happy together and completely compatible. We both are nondrinkers/nonsmokers and are into weird music and like doing different things together like going out and traveling. But, the main concern is we've been together over 3 years, and neither of us mentioned marriage or kids.  \n\nRecently, we brought up the kids matter, and how when we first started dating, I told him I do not want kids. I know he does. This is obviously a problem. But we don't want to break up and know that we are both still young. I kept trying to ask him, you know, when  does see having kids? Like 2-5 years? \n\nWhatever. He said, \"I don't know\" because the future isn't set. I agree, but he says that a lot about a lot of things. He also said that he would've already asked me to marry him if he knew I wanted kids, but he says he won't unless we agree on that whether it is or not.  I agree with this. Marriage is expensive and binding. \n\nSo how do I stay together with someone who might dump me in the future because I don't want to have kids? How to I plan a future? Decide where to live together? I am trying to be positive and happy, but it really sucks. I know that living in the now is very important. \n\nHe's my first really serious boyfriend, and he says I might change my mind, and I might, but I'll never know until time passes by. And I know he hopes I do, and I hope he changes his mind. :/ I asked him what he wants and he says to stay together and make me happy.\n\n Anyone else ever been in this situation?

She then broke up with me and in less than 2 weeks she started seeing another guy and then like a week later she had sex with him. At the same time she had a thing with a friend of mine where they kissed and talked about maybe getting into a relationship. Throughout our relationship she told me sex was really important to her and she would not do it with somebody she didnt have feelings for(She says im the only guy shes ever loved). I took that for granted and really felt that that was the right way to think since she was my first. After a month since we broke up, we got back together and thanks to my curious brain, she ended up telling me she had sex with the guy and that it was \"just sex\". Then we broke up again cause i couldnt handle the paranoia since the guy was a co-worker. 6 months after that we got back together since i though ive already forgiven her but recent events related to ex boyfriends made me remember how i felt and i realized i cant manage to forgive what she did. I feel disgusted at the mental image of her having sex with the guy and liking it as well with all the other guys shes been with. Not sure what to do to.\nTL;DR:"}

It just seems like any question i ask trying to iron out details gets vague, unhelpful responses. And should I plan on meeting her there? Should I ask to pick her up?

I'd say our relationship has bordered on co-dependent at times which is probably important for context. \n\nDavid and I are working in two completely different fields, he works in finance and I'm studying to be a teacher. I just finished up a prac at a local primary school where I met my girlfriend who I'll call Sarah. David listened to me go on and on about Sarah from the day I met her as I was crushing hard on her (felt like a teenager again). He was the one who encouraged me to make a move and gave me solid advice although he himself hasn't ever been in a serious relationship. \n\nFor anyone who is a teacher or studying to be a teacher would know that pracs are hard work (and where I live we don't get paid for them so I've had to take on extra night shifts at the restaurant I work at). Because of this my time spent with both David and Sarah has been put on the back burner. So understandably (I thought) in order to celebrate the prac coming to a finish I have organised a date with Sarah as we haven't exactly been on any \"proper dates\" since we started dating. I'm a self confessed romantic and was gushing a bit to David about how I can't wait to wine and dine Sarah when he suddenly got really shitty with me. He brought up that our mate Eric had organised drinks for this coming weekend and was annoyed that I wasn't going to be there. \n\nI'm a bit stumped as to why he's so annoyed about why I won't be attending drinks because it was only organised yesterday and we already have other plans together this weekend.

In my experience in life, I have dealt with failure many times and have just taught myself to grieve for a little bit (or just accept things) and then brush myself back off and move on.\n\nNow, I don't want to change him (I love him and accept him for who he is) but I was wondering about gentle and unconditional ways to encourage progress and help him to be a little more uninhibited. I don't want to \"nag\" him, and I want him to be happy so much, but I feel like he's conflicted about how to go about things, and he doesn't like \"accepting help\" from others.\n\nI would absolutely appreciate any help or ideas!\n\nAlso, this is my first post on Reddit, so...

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25 M] with my female friend [23]. Friends for 7 years. Has it turned toxic?\nPOST: We had a few year hiatus and started hanging out again and actually living together a year ago. Just friends, nothing more. \n\nWe recently moved 200 miles away from my hometown to live with her family. I expected some support from her; at least hanging out and her introducing me to people.\n\nIts been about a month and we've actually only gone out two or three times (with one of her friends she had in the area we moved to.) We don't have a car so we can't go anywhere and were in the middle of nowhere but I at least expected her to make time to just hang out around the house and watch a movie. She claims we hang out all the time - we live in the same house, were always together! But really its not the same quality time she has when she goes out with others.\n\nNow I'm not upset that she is out with others. I am upset I'm 200 miles away from anyone I know and she just leaves me to hang out with her parents I just met or just alone at the house. I feel hurt and unwanted. When she leaves I get anxiety, again not because she is out with friends, but because she choose not to hang out with me.\n\nEven when we are spending time together she can be incredibly short and snippy with certain topics. Its gotten to the point where I'm looking forward to just one positive interaction a day.\n\nI started to watch her young son during the day while she works and even sometimes when she goes to friends. She usually asks but tonight she just assumed I would watch him. Not too big of a deal, but.. if I can spend 10 hours a day watching your son it upsets me that I can't even get an hour of hang out time.\n\nShould there be some more give and take in this friendship? It hasn't been too long but I don't see the above pattern changing anytime soon. Is this friend toxic?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Student loan in (administrative) forbearance - will this hurt me?\nPOST: please let me know if any further details or clarifications are needed :)\n\nI received a scholarship in college that had a post-school work requirement. If the requirement was not met (which it was not) it will turn into a loan with interest. A couple days ago I received a statement in the mail. It's not a bill, and I called the lender to verify that it's not a bill and no balance is currently due from me. A loan repayment plan hasn't even been generated for me by the lender but I should be receiving communications about repayment in the near future. and I'm welcome to make payments now if I want to.\n\nHere's where I get concerned: the loan is in forbearance, some sort of administrative forbearance. the scholarship ($6k) was converted to a loan and started accruing interest (8%) on July 25. They are calling this the accrual period begin date. the accrual period end date is Sept 30. the statement says there is an anticipated capitalization amount of $242 and change on Jan 26.\n\nother than the fact that I'm currently accruing interest, will this forbearance status have any negative effect on my credit? I ask because I'm getting ready to lock in for a mortgage in the next couple weeks. when I spoke with the lender, I also asked if this is currently being reported to the credit bureaus and was told it is not because it's not in repayment and there isn't even a repayment plan associated with the loan yet. is this true, or should I call back and get a second opinion from another customer service rep at the lender?\n\nas a general note, since I imagine this will come up in discussion, I'm not prepared to make any payments on this loan any sooner than required by the lender or when the dust settles with mortgage/house initial costs - whichever comes first. however, if this forbearance status is way more harmful than I realize, I will gladly hear reasons why I should start tackling it immediately.\nTL;DR:"}

My stomach is sensitive to stress and I had an exam that day, but I have never had more than one loose stool from it and never 7+ stools like that morning. Saw my college doctor who told me it is likely stomach flu and gave me anti-diarrheal which helped that day. The next day I felt better so tried to start incorporating normal food back into my diet, but it took a turn for the worse and I spent the next two days going between extreme amounts of gas buildup to painful diarrhea and stomach pain. I went back to the doctor for bloodwork on Monday and the results came back saying there was nothing elevated to even show my immune system fighting anything (or so I understood). Monday morning was by far my worst morning in the illness so far. What does this mean - does it mean that this isn't viral or bacterial? What can this be, and why do small lapses in what I eat cause such bad consequences for days (ate a sandwich with mayo Saturday night)?\nTL;DR:"}

Around early March at the end of the school year she broke up with me and said we weren't compatible anymore. Her real reasoning was that I was a little anti-social sometimes and was inflexible at times. \n\nA few days after we broke up, she texted me and we started talking and saying how we would like to continue to still hook-up and have sex together. A few weeks later she went to Spain for 6.5 weeks and came back last week. Her entire time in Spain she told me how she missed me and wished I was there exploring with her and having fun. Not to mention she missed having sex with me. She facetimed me multiple times a week and texted me constantly. She would get drunk at times and tell me how much she still loves me (drunk words are sober thoughts?) At one point she even discussed being the girl in my life for as long as we live.\n\nTwo days after she returned I took her on a date in DC and we had a fabulous time together. And had sex numerous times and I slept at her house. A few days later we went to the beach together and had another great time. This weekend she is coming to my house to stay the weekend.\n\nThe problem is she has told me she wants me back but is scared and doesn't know if it's the right move. She claims we can still be in each others lives and have sex but we should keep it simple and stay friends for now.\nTL;DR:"}

When I visited the link, it was an excerpt (about half of the small first paragraph) followed by a link to read the rest on my site.  Within that excerpt are tons of those in-text ad links that pop up with random ads when you roll over them. Seems harmless but obnoxious, right?  Do I have any recourse? Obviously, this is not something I would go to court for or take too seriously, but does something like this fall under DMCA where I can simply make a request for removal.  I don't have any illusions that I am shitting gold on my site, but something still feels wrong when someone takes an excerpt for the sole purpose of generating ad revenue.  Is that considered fair use?  The person did not add any commentary or improve the work in any way.  What does reddit think about this?

During the lead up to things ending, I had also started a new job and met a female colleague who had recently gone through experiences very similar to the things going wrong in my relationship. We have become closer and closer as we confided in each other and supported, in most ways platonically. She was sort of dating low key, but has since stopped as we became closer. She's recently begun asking to hang out outside of work, get dinner etc. The culmination of this is that she asked me to go on a vacation with her this fall. Sort of a week long camping excursion, which we both very much enjoy. She has expressed she isn't looking to date, and hasn't expressed any feelings for me. A friend joked that something must be going on between us and she laughed it off but said of course not. We do talk via text almost all day, more than I do with any other friends or even past girlfriends. She has been very proactive in making plans. Also took on a new hobby that I've long be into, and asked that I teach her. Afraid of rejection or misinterpreting the friendship if I were to ask her out. Is there more to this friendship that I'm too daft to see, is she possibly looking for more? Hoping someone has magic answer but I know this probably isn't realistic.\nTL;DR:"}

In the mean time I'm still texting my friend and I ask him for a ride to Gamestop so I can return some games.\n\nHe comes and picks me up, we have good conversation and go to the store, neither of us commenting about the Minnie Mouse on my head because initially my hair was slightly covering it. It's pretty windy as we walk towards the store and it must have blown my hair out of the way. We walk in and I go towards the cashier. Normally at this point in a visit to any store the employee initiates some sort of conversation like \"What can I help you with?\" but this guy is just standing there staring at me. I'm trying to figure out why he looks so confused but I can't think of any reason for this *\"The fuck is wrong with you?\"* look he's giving me.\n\nWe end up having a really awkward transaction and my friend and I walk out of the store.

I am unsure of how exactly not to mess up and to actually get her back.\n\nA bit of backstory, last january I met a girl and shortly afterwards we hooked up. I expressed doubt in dating, not because I didn't like her, but rather because I might have been moving a few hours away within a month. She persuaded me to stay and I got a job so that I could stay and date her.\n\nRecently she broke up with me, quoting reasons like \"i don't have enough time with College and band\" and how she thought that i should be a nicer person (not to her because I was nice to her, but in general.) She has told me that she does love me, and is unsure whether she would like to get back together or not; but that she would give me a chance to improve my social interactions. In the past two weeks I have done everything in my power to be much nicer (mainly because my being a dick is a reflex and a habit from abuse.)

I would much rather spend $30 bucks for car insurance than $130. \n\nOur agent/broker told us \"that it's best to have bodily injury because if for some reason I get into an accident and I am at fault, then they can sue me, and since I have nothing, they can go after my father and put a lean on his house\". Is this legally possible? Now I'm not planning on getting in an accident, I'm a safe driver, but if for some reason I get into an accident and it was my fault, can they go after my fathers assets? Back when I did drivers ed I read about Florida being a no fault state. What does this mean in layman terms? Does this help or hurt my situation? \n\nDo I need to get the more expensive plan?

I'm 22, I was recently called in for an interview for a web developer position at a local company. Great right? Here's my dilemma.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I left my web developer position at a different company locally, for several reasons. One, I hated the work environment, it was quite restricive, no opportunities to improve myself, and it was almost soul sucking. Second, I didn't want to be a web developer. I originally took a program at college to be a 3D Artist, and I still want to do that. I'm currently just learning new skills and building my portfolio, but I'm not ready quite yet. \n\nWhile I was working, I was working two jobs, and I still have the second. It's just delivering pizza, it keeps my rent and bills paid. It's part time at nights.\n\nNow of course, I haven't got it yet and I might not, but I am more than qualified for this particular position, so I feel confident about it. So let's assume for now that I did get it. In order for me to still work towards becoming a 3D Artist, I will have to quit my second job. This will completely screw my boss there over, who has become a good friend of mine, and my coworkers too, who are all friends I grew up with. Now this doesn't mean I can't quit ever, just right now would be non ideal. (He is very short staffed and has terrible luck finding good workers)\n\nIf I keep both jobs, I won't have time trying to build my personal portfolio, delaying me becoming a 3D Artist, as I will have to balance two jobs, my girlfriend and friends. And I absolutely don't want to get stuck as a web developer.\n\nEssentially, I would take this job for money.

She moved out on her own and started to transition and my parents have completely cut her out of their lives. They've gotten rid of all the pictures of her in the house and all the belongings she left behind, like her childhood toys and stuff. When they do refer to her, they call her by her old name and use male pronouns still, but they pretty much don't talk about her. And they've made it clear that if I have any contact with her they will kick me out and not have anything to do with me either. I have pretty much always known Emily was a girl even before she came out, and it doesn't matter to me, she will always be my sister and my best friend and I love her no matter what. I am so depressed over not being able to see her or even talk to her, I feel like I'm grieving for her and she's not even dead. But I can't get kicked out because I'll have nowhere to go. The last time I talked to Emily (she came to visit me at work) she said that it wasn't worth becoming homeless on her account and that I should just pretend until I can move out. I'm beginning to feel like I'm going crazy and I think I probably need counseling or something but I'm on my parents insurance and they would want to know why. I hate them so much for what they're putting me and Emily through. I don't know what I can do in this situation because I'm a long way off from being able to support myself but I don't think I can go on like this too much longer, it feels like a chunk of my heart is missing and I just wish there was something I could say to make them reconsider what they're doing.\nTL;DR:"}

She will make out with someone that she knows somewhat well, but it can't be anywhere that someone could possibly have a chance of seeing her. We talk a lot about sexual things but she is very reluctant to talk on the topic when it turns towards her and her experiences. She has told me that she wishes she wasn't shy and in her words \"prudish\".\n  \nI do like her as more than a friend and she is very well aware of this. I really do want to help her but i'm worried if I just try to \"help\" her on my own it would be from the part that wants to be more than friends, and not from the part that is essentially her best and one of her few friends.\n  \nShe has never had a boyfriend and doesn't understand the process someone goes through to get one and where to go from there. I had told her that the first step to be less shy was to try to be a little more open when talking about herself. After 20 minutes or so she was being more open with herself than I thought she would be and that kind of told me that she was serious about wanting to change.\n  \nI'm wondering if there is anything that I can do to help her or if there are things we can do or talk about that can get her to be open with herself both physically and emotionally but not something that can hurt the friendship.\n  \nPlease be honest with how you feel about this or if you personally think im crossing a line.\nTL;DR:"}

Ive opened various other credit cards that get me good cash back or rewards and never carry a balance. I typically do not close revolving balance accounts as I've understood that having a good outstanding balance to available credit limit ratio was in my favor. One card I have (had, now) with citi was a rather low limit card ($2600) that I used to use a long time ago when it gave me 5% on gas.

This works by the bank charging our account for the amount and mailing a check to our landlord's address on a set date every month. Last month, our landlord complained that our rent check had not arrived, even though the bank confirmed it had been delivered. So we put a stop on the check that had been sent (and told our landlord) and the money went back into our account, and we wrote a personal check and mailed it to our landlord ourselves. Obviously it was late as a result, but he did receive payment. \n\nA couple weeks later, he finally received the check that had originally been sent by the bank. He tried to cash it, found that there was a stop on it, and messaged us complaining that a stop had been put on the check... this was confusing because he had already received and cashed the replacement check for rent that month. He seemed annoyed that a stop had been put on the check. \n\nNow this month apparently the same thing has happened again. I don't know what part of the process is problematic - the bank, the post office, the mailbox in our landlord's building? The bank seems to think the check has been properly delivered, we have a confirmation of payment on our account. Now our landlord wants to charge us late fees for the missing rent check, are we obligated to pay him when we've made a reasonable effort to deliver the money to him? We've offered to stop the auto bill pay and issue post dated checks instead but he doesn't seem too interested in that. He is also telling us not to put a stop on the check being sent from the bank, but in that case we are not comfortable issuing him a new check for this month's rent, because based on his previous behavior he would try to cash both checks.\n\nWe have lived here for almost 2 years and never had a problem with the bill pay system or our landlord.

We love each other, but he absolutely cannot get over this one, single thing. Here's the story.\nAfter I came back to Tennessee where I attend college (I was up in Baltimore with him all throughout winter break), I met up with my best friend since middle school at her apartment. Normally I'm very boring and don't do anything other than study, shop, and go to class. Well, I went to see her, and she asked me if I would like to drink a little bit with her. Although I don't usually drink, I decided to go ahead and have some fun with my friend I rarely see. I didn't get drunk or anything, I only had 3 drinks and was perfectly capable of walking, reading, and using the restroom by myself. When I was a bit tipsy, I went with my friend and her roommates to a dance club. We were all too young to get in (we're 19 and 18). Thus, one of her roommates wanted to see this guy she likes; so we went to his apartment. I sat with my friend and didn't even talk to the guy and his roommates. Well, during this whole series of events our designated driver kept all of our phones to avoid drunk phone calls and texts. So, my boyfriend got worried about me and texted me a few times.

It seems like a really small matter and I feel a little stupid asking an advice about this. But I decided to give it a go:)\n\nSo I started university this semester. I'm studying a combined set of 3 main courses - and naturally we're a very small group that does this certain degree. One of them I obviously only met at uni, and I think she's way too clingy/depended on me and I'm getting slightly irritated.\n\nIt shows in the little things, but it shows: whenever I go sit somewhere, she HAS to sit next to me, and if I go somewhere she asks me where; when I type/do something on my laptop or even my phone she has to look what I'm doing or ask something and comment about it (which feels a little invasive); we also went out all the students to celebrate another classmate's birthday, and she was very determined to order exactly what I ordered ( I debated wheather to order a meal or just coffee, and she was like \"no, don't leave me alone!\"... you can order whatever you like, you don't need me for that...). \nThings like that. She has an issue with a classmate that hangs with us a lot, and constantly tells me about all the things that piss her off about her, often via texts and calls that just last forever. I'm a pretty private person and I like my personal space, and the whole situation bugs me a lot. Am I overreacting and being needlessly judgemental? She is a very nice girl though and I would like to keep a good relationship especially when the class is so small, plus she doesn't deserve getting hurt or feeling unwanted... but in the other hand her dependence can get really uncomfortable for me.\nAny advice?\nTL;DR:"}

He decided to go with his heart and dumped me. He said he felt comfortable, happy, loving and safe with me. He thinks that I am beautifully, smart, funny, tolerance and forgiving. He never met such special girl that has such nice personality. We seldom argued. He said that I am the dream girl of him, he likes the sex we had, the great care and love I gave him. \n\nBut one day he met this girl (his colleagues, I only know that she is elder than me), he felt so strong romance with her. He said he cannot stop think of her, he wants to be close to her, do romantic things with her. He said he never had this feeling in his life, he wants to feel this passion, at least once in his life, even if this means he has to give me up. \n\nI was so heart broken. I explained to him that passion is just an illusion. He said he has to try, he must do this, 31 years in his life, he never felt so passion to someone. He also was honest to me about his feelings that he wants to explore, hopefully can have a future with her, so he wouldn't regret to split with me; he also told me that he still loves me and misses a lot, he is scared of losing me and scared of regreting giving me up. I understand how he felt, I am not mad at him at all. My heart hurt so much knowing he likes another girl, but I know I have to show my understanding.\nTL;DR:"}

Since we've been married 5 years ago we have kept separate accounts.  We are now living off my income and saving 100% of her paycheck.  To do this we had to get really serious about budgeting and tracking our finances/bills.  We started out with Quicken (and still use it) and while it has quite a good feature set I can't stand how limited it is from a \"mobile\" standpoint. I'm not talking about just my phone, im talking about how there is no web interface for it so I can pull up the information at work.  The mobile app is very limited and it is mostly relegated to \"read-only\" information other than entering transaction.  The whole quicken package seems very 1998.  I feel like in 2015 I should be able to access every feature everywhere.  One of the really big features that Quicken has that I can't find in other products is the calendar view. We find it very it helpful to be able to see all of our expenses/bills for the month in a calendar.  Not only that it also shows us our projected balance in our checking account for each day based on our bills. I feel like I've searched the internet for something that has this but of the few I've found, most require all of your transactions to be entered manually instead of having some type of online sync with your banking institution.

It was a self-serve one so all I did was work the cash, stock the shelves, clean garbage, etc. I had been working at the gas station for just under three months and I was rocking it there. I was top seller for car washes for the last two months in a row, and I completed most of the chores my coworkers didn't feel like doing since I was the new guy.\n\nThis was fine with me, I was just happy to have a job so close to home. However, one day, the manager came in and asked me to go out and clean and repair the car wash. In the short time I had been there, I had learned how the system worked, so I was kind of handy when it came to fixing the machines. Only thing was, this was in the summer and we were in the middle of a major heat wave. I didn't complain though, I just went out and did it. It wasn't very busy and so my other coworker was able to take over the cash register. (I should note that we usually worked in pairs at this gas station). \n\nI came back after about an hour of cleaning the entire car wash area and repairing some of the broken hoses, drenched in sweat. Once back in the store, I saw the manager's son, who I knew quite well since he visited the place often. He was in work uniform, standing at my cash register. I asked what was going on and the manager simply told me that I was not up to their standards and since it was within the \"three month probation period\" they could fire me for any reason they pleased without warning.

First, my friend was studying it and it sounded good, secondly I thought as I spent most my time on the PC (playing games) this was the best step to take.\n\nNow. I could just start a new 3/4 year course, but there's no telling they'd accept me.

He doesn't have many real friends), and when I tag him on Facebook he'll play it off or hide it from his profile. \nRegardless of ALL these problems he's perfect.

He's in a great university in a killer course with a great gpa. He's athletic and really handsome (even if he doesn't believe it), cooks really well, and is one of the smartest guys I know. I on the other hand, am at a 'meh' university because I'm not that book smart. I'm good with people, I'm quite funny, I'm street smart but I'm really not that book smart. I have a lot of smart friends for some reason, but Ted is probably the smartest. \n\nI know that if we broke up, he'd get a smart girl from his own university anytime. He's even going for his sumemr exchange soon, and I'm really happy for him but I feel like I'll jsut be holding him down. I've talked to him before asking if him he wanted a break when he went for his summer exchange, but he was hurt I even thought of going on a break. \n\nDuring our first year together I had told him he could find someone much better than me, but he seems to think the same of me (he thinks that I can get much better than him).

I don't want to have to explain my reasons for breaking up with her and subsequently insult her (she may be dumb but she's still a decent person). I don't really want to blindside her with it, but I definitely don't want to do what I've done before and just make a break up inevitable by being really emotionally distant.\n\nMaybe I should add that I have been affectionate towards her even after I realized I wanted to end it because when I get nervous with a SO I just react with affection, so she would have no idea of my disdain for her. Also we're on break in different places so I haven't seen her for like 12 days and it has made me much more aware of how much I don't want to continue this relationship.\nAny advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I do trust her, but I'm have a lot of anxiety about cheating in general) I worked in a nursing home. Reported this girl for sleeping in one of the residence rooms on shift, got her fired. She got a friend of hers who worked there to file like 3 false reports I was abusing elderly people. (Friend hated me because I got promoted over her/wanted my job) Nursing home has to investigate so I'm on leave for a week while they do. Go home that night pissed and scared. GF of 5 years goes to hang out with friends and cheats on me. worst part she decided to tell me about the cheating while we're having sex...like the very middle of having sex. I'm home on suspension for a week scared to spend any money to distract myself because I might be getting fired. The investigation came to nothing and I got paid for the week off.

Come to think of this, 25 years and I have liked only 5 girls, and none worked out.

I live alone, and I make an ok salary.

Her and this girl, and a gay guy.\nBut there's a little part of me that feels nervous and distrustful. I've seen on her phone. When she's just hanging with me instead of doing something with them, she'll tell them a lie and not mention me at all. I think this girl likes her slightly. I feel like there may be tension between them. I caught them doing something flirty with each other. Last time I asked her about them, she told me she doesn't want to be anything more than friends with her. I accepted that. But her voice wasn't confident. And the fact that she lies to them about hanging out with me, maybe she's lying to me about not liking her?! I feel immature, but when you really love someone you fear the heartbreak of them lying to your face. Should I bring it up again??

I've cut her off before but she actually seems mad that I didn't go see her. I'm scratching my head, wth if you wanted to see me why didn't you just stop by? Why would she get angry if all you need to do is pick up the phone and call or drop by anytime?\n\nI'm getting tired of making all the effort but if i cut her off she gets offended.  I don't want to start some fight over this, I'm not a child and I'm not into drama.  I know she values the friendship but frankly I'm tired of putting in all the effort.  \n\nAny female advice here?

I assumed that she would assume that I would be paying her back. \n\nThe reason I haven't gotten a job yet is because I have a practical part of my uni course that takes up all of my time for 4 weeks that started on the 18/1. I don't believe someone would employ me knowing that I have to take off 4 weeks immediately. Because of this my gf has assumed that our current arrangement was going to stay in place until I drained her dry, and now says that I'm lazy and doesn't believe that I will be getting a job as soon as my prac is over.\n\nMy other short comings was that I didn't contribute to the house as much as I should be. I've agreed that this is the case but I had my reasons for this. She thinks that no matter what the reasons there's no excuse for not pitching in. Which I agree to but. If I'm pitching in as much as I should be and then she comes home and is just snarky with me then what's my incentive to keep on going. I admit I was in a bad place because of bad communication between us. But she refuses to see that.\n\nThe current problem is. I leave this Wednesday for the 2nd half of my prac and I won't see her for the next 2 weeks. I don't want to be spending the entire time I'm away wondering about our relationship status. \n\nI need your view points because I can't continue on like this. I need to know what's going on but I don't want to be unreasonable.\nTL;DR:"}

Being both horny and knowing the guy is a chill dude, I thought why not ?\n\nWhen we get to his place, he suddenly gets very silent, not engaging in any manner and won't initiate the act. I actually snuggle up next to him, try to start things up and he stays there like a wooden plank. But we eventually we get to it. He seems to enjoy the sex, I mean it wasn't the greatest, not the worse, kind of awkward but nothing major. We go our seperate ways, and a few days later I end up texting the guy just like we used to because to me he's still a friend. He barely answers and stops texting me all together, so I don't push it, though I'm pretty hurt.\n\nFast forward to a week ago, his sister tells me he's having sex with this chick from college in the room right next to hers. Right away I'm EXTREMELY jealous, the feeling is eating me up and I realize that he probably really disliked the hookup which makes me feel even worse because I didn't want to let him down.\n\nTo top all of this, I went to a friend's party a few days ago and to forget the whole ordeal, drank too much (to the point of sickness). This really nice girl helps me and lays me down on a sofa. When everyone goes to sleep around me, I hear weird noises. Turns out that the nice girl and my crush are getting it on under the sheets a few feet from me. Being the drunken jerk I am, I get up, go get my purse, take 2 condoms and throw the condoms at them and in the most condescending voice say 'By all means, don't stop.'.\n\nWHAT THE HELL is wrong with me?

Like any young kid, I've fallen behind on rent a few times, where I've called the private owner, explained my situation, and he'd understood, and I've paid him that very week (most I was late was 6 days, I believe). During a recent credit check on getting this new apartment, my leasing agent informed me there were a few items on my credit report from late payment of rent, and that this could make my security deposit higher, or even deny me the apartment.\n\nMy question is: Since this was under the table renting and I never signed a lease or contract (or even gave him more info than my name and phone number), can he legally report these to my credit report without my knowledge? And if not, is there any recourse I can take to get these taken off my reports? If it is perfectly legal for him to do so, I have no problem with them being on the report; it was my fault in being late, and it should reflect on my history. I'm just more or less upset that he gathered my SSN, previous employer, email address (this, not so much, not hard to find online), and current employer without my knowledge, AND has been reporting to my credit report without a signed contract. Any advice would be very helpful. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

We finally decide to go on a date. We had a good time (not great, but still really good.). It was sort of a blind date. but we had seen each others facebooks, so we knew what each other looked like. We went to a museum to look at a Da Vinci exhibit, and even watch a planetarium show. He bought our tickets ($45.00 total) and bought us some astronaut ice cream(we had talked about loving it). I than bought him and myself a plastic robot that is molded right in front of you. After the museum we went to a pretty expensive restaurant. (I think that guys should not have to pay for every aspect of a date ... especially when it gets up into $100's) So I offered quite a few times to pay for dinner until he finally agreed. $54.00, and throughout dinner I would catch him staring at me. After Dinner we went to a coffee shop and sat for about an hour just talking and playing cards(he paid for coffee).  Well, after the 7 and a half hour date (from 1:30pm to 9:00pm) We had done so many things, that we decided to go home. He told me to text him when I got home and I did. He called me and we talked for about 3 hours. He told me how he really liked me, and I him. and Even told me a story about how he was going to hold my hand but was to nervous. \n\nSo the next day We text back and fourth briefly.

Due to this, J now has panic attacks/mini seizures during sex or any foreplay sometimes due to memories flooding back in her head. I was the only person she has ever dated who was able to look past that and be ok with just holding her, taking things slow at whatever pace she liked. When she had her attacks I would stop and just care for her and we would just fall asleep together. We dated and then lived together for about 6 months before I ended things because I am leaving for the military soon and it just wouldn't of worked out. She is still very much in love with me or at least how I treated her.\n\nAnyways this story isn't about me.

I am glad she is getting herself out there and looking for someone, truly, however, he just raped her. \n\nShe had one of her panic attacks and started crying, saying no no no, and basically losing control.

Ok, that's one thing. But, she's still got them around on her hard drive. I couldn't really get my head around why she would keep them. We essentially disagreed and left it at that.

I asked her if her ex was big and she said yes, and that the sex was pretty good.\n\nNow, she's still on contact with this guy, claiming they are just friends and message each other every other day.

We ended up hanging out more often, and never really had a \"label\" - I was happy with the way things were going. \n\nHe did mention that he had trouble opening up to people so I let him be - if he wanted to tell me something he would do it and I wouldn't pressure him. \n\nWell, lately he had a lot happening in his life (death, working a lot, second job) but I found out he was going through a divorce, too. He said he got married at 18, he's not with her. \n\nI tried limiting the amount of times ill text him, and would barely hear from him. \n\nFinally, yesterday I asked him to tell me if he still wanted me in his life or if he's too busy, I just wanted to know. He said it depends what I want us to be (move in together?) and that he's messed up with relationships now. I said no (im not crazy), I just want to know if I should back off until he's figured everything out. \n\nFinally he said \"as for right now I don't think there's much I can offer you babe :(\" and I was relieved, in a way. I thanked him for being honest, wished him luck and said maybe sometime in the future? He said of course. \n\nAnyway, question is, do you think I fucked up by being too needy? Should i not have brought it up at all? I like this guy and we clicked pretty well, i just don't know what to do right now.\nTL;DR:"}

So I've been hanging out with this girl for the past couple of months, and we've been holding hands, cuddling, making out, going on dates, and we slept together last week. A couple of weeks before we started getting physical, she'd broken up with a boyfriend. So because of this, she's told me she isn't ready for a relationship right now (most likely wants to go out and have fun) - but she's told me she likes me and cares about me. She also isn't really much of a texter, and I seem to always be the one who has to initiate us hanging out, even though she'll usually always accept, and then we'll get on great and have a great time.\n\nNow, obviously I'm really into her, so I'm feeling a bit of anxiety at the moment because I'm stuck in limbo and don't know where I stand exactly. I want to ask her where I stand (for some piece of mind), if we're going somewhere at all, if there's a chance of us becoming something in the future... but I'm worried I'll sound needy/clingy and scare her off.\n\nShould I talk to her about this, or maybe just keep going at a slow pace for a bit longer and talk to her about it at a later date?\nAny other advice anyone has on this dilemma would seriously be appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

On a wednesday morning at 10:00 a.m. I didn\u00b4t have any classes, so I tried to get some groceries. I just needed some water and meat, so I went to the cheapest supermarket and gathered my stuff. Even after getting into the checkout line, I still listened to my headphones, so I wasn\u00b4t really aware of my surroundings, shortly before me some 40-something bought a bottle of wine and a bottle of Ballantines. \nAfter that, it was my turn so I removed my headphones and suddenly the security gates begin beeping.\nThe man panicks, blushes and eventually comes back to the cashier. Turns out she didn\u00b4t check one of the bottles out. As he took them once again from the counter, he looks me dead in the eye and says:\n\"I don\u00b4t steal, I am a christian.\"\nSo my head just made me throw out the first thought that came to my mind: \n\"Hey, I\u00b4m not the one buying two bottles of booze at ten in the morning.\"\nEveryone just looked at me, until I realised, what I just said. The man was shortly baffled,after that he immediatly started a rant about the youth these days and no respect for elders in our society for about ten minutes. Everybody else was just dead silent. Eventually I just took my stuff and tried to run for it, but this man just followed me for a few metres and ranted even louder.

His shelf has books by CS Lewis and Francis Collins and some others.  And he's living with me and our parents for the next few weeks before he moves to another city for his new job.  Last night at dinner the conversation turned to dad reciting a quote from mother Teresa.  So then I pointed out what a bigot and all around horrible person she was.  Then my brother chimed in and said that's all highly exaggerated.  So then I got frustrated and said that his invisible friend in the sky doesn't exist.  Those were pretty much my exact words.  Dinner ended shortly thereafter and he just walked away.  \n\nSo all day today he was just...distant.  I can't say he gave me the silent treatment because we still interacted, but for him it was the bare minimum - \"yeah, no, sure\".  So this evening I asked him why he's been avoiding me all day.  He said he's fine if I disagree with him on religion, but he won't accept my \"attitude\" towards his beliefs (I assume he meant the \"invisible friend in the sky line).  I told him to get used to it, and then he just rolled his eyes and walked away.  I really hope he lightens up, because before this we were talking about times I could come visit him.

It doesn't really affect his ability to learn, aside from the fact that he needs some extra time on tests and things of that sort, but he has a really hard time making friends and I worry about him.\n\nHe has a fear of opening up to people that comes from his disorder and from terrible bullying throughout elementary school and middle school, and that fear causes him to behave strangely. All those years of missed social interaction leaves him with the interpersonal skills of someone much younger. Things like carrying a conversation and talking to strangers are very difficult for him. The bullying as a child caused him to retreat to video games as his only real hobby, and now he really can't talk to anybody about much else. My mother is now calling on me, the \"social butterfly\" of the family to help him out, and I really don't know what to do. I've somehow managed to have a great group of friends but I don't know how to help someone do the same.\n\nHe has just come home from his first year of college, and he has absolutely nothing to do.

For example, I got annoyed when her mom was 30 minutes late to a breakfast date her mother invited us to.  Another example, I got frustrated when putting up the Christmas tree and hastily responded, \"No, I have a better idea\" to one of her suggestions, and brushed her off.

The capper is when she pulls out the line, \"I feel like you don't love me.\"  Which bugs me quite a bit too, since I do, or at least I think I do.  This all hinges on the fact that her parents had a garbage relationship, ended up in an ugly divorce.  She is afraid that is how we're going to end up like that.  Things are fine when she is happy, but when there is a disagreement it may as well be the end of the relationship every time.

When I mean perfectionist, I meant he is almost suffering from acute perfectionism.\n\nEverything he does has to be done perfectly. How he holds the knife and fork, the creases on his collar, the colors he wears, the arrangement of his watch. He has severe OCD.

So, in public he does okay.\n\nHe lives in a huge penthouse. And he does everything himself. He cleans and maintains and even paints it himself. From every book on the shelf to the arrangement of his cutlery. He is obsessed with having everything spotless clean and perfectly placed. His house looks like those houses you see in magazines which are always clean with polished wooden floors.\n\nNow, obviously I'm not like him. I'm clean but not as neurotically obsessed with cleanliness as he is. So, I've messed up his place before. He simply smiles and puts it back together the way he likes it. He's never been angry/frustrated with me over it. Or if he has, he hasn't shown it. \n\nI'm honestly scared that I'll make his life hell if I move in. I mean, I desperately want to move in with him. I want to sleep next to him every night and be with him most of the day. I'm just scared if I push his buttons too much. I can't lose him to 'incompatibility' because he's amazing in every aspect, and I've never loved someone like this.\n\nI'm just super anxious and worried. Any advice will be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I wanted to get one for my long distant boyfriend when I realized he could do more than sea life. \n\nI had told my boyfriend that he's getting a turtle because that is what I was involved with while volunteering. The craftsman,  we will call him Eduardo, said he could carve out the Stark sigil from Game of Thrones in white, to look like Jon Snow's direwolf Ghost, from cow horn. The plan was to put it on a medallion shaped pendant. \n\n I hadn't seen him in a week and I became nervous thinking it wouldn't be as expected. \n\nThe day before I left, Eduardo showed up explaining (as best as he could in Spanish,  which I don't speak) that the medallion broke and he found it much too difficult to do again,  and started carving its profile.  It took him 4 hours and I paid him a bigger tip than what he originally priced the necklace at (it came out to USD $14)\n\n I'm fucked because it's so perfect that I want to keep it for myself.\nTL;DR:"}

He usually puts his head just above my knee on my leg. He loves this spot as it is directly in front of my window ac, and being a husky he loves it.\n\nSo today i had some homemade extra spicy tacos. They kind of gave me some sever gas. So i have been farting all night. When i went to lay down he came in like normal, and laid down between my legs. After about 5-10 minutes he was sleeping, when i felt it coming. I tried to hold it in, and let is disperse on its own but it wasn't going to go that way. As i shifted my leg, i let one rip, it was loud. It scared my dog, as he was jumping up and freaking out, his paws stomped my bag, at which point i rolled around. As i rolled around from the pain in my balls, i knocked my dog off the bed with my leg.\n\nSorry for grammar and spelling will fix as i notice\nTL;DR:"}

We usually have 2 a day that run one after the other.\n\nAfter group number one passes through, we get a call about a sleep needing to be done (aka euthanasia). Not observing and no paw print. Easy peasy, but not pleasant.\n\n On the first attempt to find the vein, the dog struggled and we fucked up so we has to use the opposite leg. I'm the new person so I was holding. Switched sides and that time went easier. I waited a bit to collect myself (I'm not a monster) before returning the crate and collar to the owner. \n\nAs I left the room, the second group of kids were right in front of me waiting to see the critters. Wide eyes, some screams, and a bit of crying alerted me to the fact that I got a large amount of blood on my shirt from holding on the side of the blown out vein. \n\nThe collar and crate didn't help. \n\nWe tried to convince them I was just helping to give a dog medicine but they're too old to believe that. \n\nThis will be the longest 11 hour shift of my life.\nTL;DR:"}

Today while in class a girl made a very rude comment about me. She said no one would ever trust me as a surgeon because of my mental illness. I have PTSD, OCD, MDS, and an anxiety disorder. I am prone to audio and visual hallucinations. 90% of the time I can identify them and control them. The other 10% is when I wake up from a night terror and the dream will somewhat continue. That can be confusing. I do often have anxiety attacks, though I push through them, and take my medication as little as possible (it is a take as needed). I have some brain damage as well. Mostly effects my short term memory and language skills. \n\nFor 3 years I have been working on getting better. Most people do not know about my problems unless I tell them. I was wondering if you think people would trust me as a surgeon? I may be smart enough but does that mean I will ever be cleared for a job? Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

We have a nightly routine and he has always been awesome at it. We get up and get ready for bed, he waits by the door. We let him out and say \"potty\", he does his business. Once done, he comes immediately in and lays in his bed. We reward him and he proceeds to snooze. \n\nThis has been the routine up until about a month ago. Now he goes out, goes potty, then wanders around the yard for a while. He generally has good recall, so we tell him to \"come\" and he ignores us. Sometimes if I jingle this metal treat tin, he comes, sometimes he still ignores us.\n\nHow do I reinforce \"come\" when he only seems to be bad at it in this situation? Tonight I stood outside for 3 minutes asking him to come and he didn't come until I closed the door and pretended to leave him. I wanted to reward him for coming inside, but I didn't want to reward him because I don't want him to think he can ignore me and still get a treat.\nTL;DR:"}

Tall, blonde, soccer player with glasses. \n\nI wouldn't assume I'm his type (curvy, curly-headed chick with piercings) but the amount we flirt says otherwise. We don't work together a whole lot but when we do it's constant eyelash-batting and smiling. \n\nSo, I'm pretty sure he's into me. A coworker swears he gives me \"googly-eyes\" whenever he's walking up to the desk while I'm working. We spent the time today before opening teasing each other about having to work most of our shifts this week (spring break) together. We even had to clean shelves in the same section and he'd \"psst\" at me whenever he could see me through them. We spent the last few minutes of that talking about random stuff as I decided to finish early to bug him. \n\nMy question is just how to be 100% certain and how to move forward. He's an energetic and peppy dude. I feel like I'm the only person he really hardcore flirts with but maybe I'm a little blind. As far as moving on, I don't want to make a move if he's not into me. Tonight the campus is doing a network outage and he was complaining about not having anything to do. I thought about asking if he wanted to hang out considering his dorm is close to mine but I'm not sure how to ask without turning into an awkward, stuttering mess.\nTL;DR:"}

I never did, at least none that weren't far away, so today I finally trekked to the campus bookstore and bought the textbook I needed.\n\nI walked into the store, guy's like, \"Hi, may I help you?\" I'm like, \"Yeah! I'm looking for a microeconomics textbook?\" I told him the author and he showed me the book. I picked it up and brought it to the checkout, and then I was distracted by finding out that one of my friends works there, so I didn't really pay attention to what I was buying.\n\nI put the book in my backpack and didn't look at it again until now, when I brought it up to my room to study from. That's when it dawned on me... I picked up the WRONG BOOK. I already have a copy of this EXACT textbook from my Intro to Microeconomics class last semester. What I actually needed to buy was the MACROeconomics textbook, which has a similar cover, is the same edition and is by the same author and publisher.\n\nI'm just hoping that I can return it. My macroeconomics class is at 8 AM tomorrow morning so I'm planning to go as soon as the bookstore opens (which is probably 8, so I'll be late to my class, but whatever really) and see if I can return the book. It's still in the plastic wrap, but I may not be able to since it has a code for an online thing within the packaging and books with e-learning materials can't always be returned, even if they haven't already been opened. :/ If I can't return it, I just paid $160 for something I don't even need.\nTL;DR:"}

They were only acquaintances as they never worked in the same team. Apparently, Jess had a big crush on my BF and asked their common friend for his number. Jess then decided to ask out my BF, for which he showed me her texts and he decided not to reply. This did not seem to bother her, because she still tried to flirt with him or had their common friends invite him to parties, etc. \n\nNow I admit I'm a bit of the jealous type and even though there is nothing in this woman I should be jealous of, I was PISSED. John would often talk about me, post photos on Facebook with me, sometimes he would even set our photo as his profile picture so I know she knows he's in a relationship. It just feels disrespectful to me but I never did confront her because I trust my BF. Anyway, aside from me being pissed off, her attempts did not have any effect on our relationship. \n\nFast forward to now, I just found out that she is going to work in my place of employment. And she's going to be working closely with me as she was hired specifically for a project that I'm currently spearheading. Now I don't know how to approach this situation? I'm pretty close with all of my teammates because I'm quite extroverted and I'm always trying to help people or make people laugh. If I try to stay just standard professional with her, people would know something is up. But I don't really want to get chummy/friendly with her at all, for reasons that I don't make friends with people who try to break up other people's relationships (I've been cheated on more than once). \n\nIf you're in my position, please let me know how you would proceed. :)\nTL;DR:"}

I was in the office break room getting my morning caffeine fix.  We have a selection of tea and two big pump coffee dispensers.

We make small talk about the super nice MN weather.  As we're chatting, I forget I decided on tea and start pumping coffee into my cup, over the teabag.  You know, like an idiot. By the time I figured out what I was doing it was already too late.  My boss had just witnessed my fuck up.  He asked me what I was doing.  The REAL fuck up is that instead of saying, \"whoops, I got distracted and accidentally filled my cup with coffee instead of hot water,\" I instead tried to play it off like I do this all the time.

Lately, we've been noticing certain items from around the house coming up missing, \"coincidentally\" (or not) being discovered as such shortly after he'd visited prior. He is a known thief, and even has a criminal record because of it (among other things).\n\nNow, we have no proof that he took any of the missing items, other than one. My ma and I were having a discussion about how these things come up missing after he's been over, and she called him and asked him about it (did not accuse him of anything, just asked if he had or had seen them). He admitted to taking a toolbox, which he said he \"borrowed\" to fix his car and \"forgot\" to return, but since that could happen to anyone we were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.\nI'm assuming someone else in the house (don't know who, really doesn't matter honestly) must have overheard the entire conversation and told him about it.\n\nThis morning, I got a text message from him, in which he threatened to \"beat the shit out of [me]\" for \"lying about [him] again\". It was only the one message, but he does have a history of violence, and even has at least one willful injury charge on his record (there could be more, but I only know of the one), so I know he's actually capable of doing so. I did not reply to the message and have not been in contact with him at all, though I did show the message to my ma.\n\nMy question, then, is can I take this matter to the police and, if I do, would anything come of it? There is at least one other illegal thing he is doing currently (that I can reasonably prove), and if he's not caught and dealt with by the police, I fear he will never learn his lesson.\nTL;DR:"}

Here's some background on what the situation was:\n\nI went to visit a friend of mine in Vista, California (just north of the city of San Diego). Let's call him Joe. Joe lives in an apartment complex obviously being private property. I understood that completely as well as the fact that you need a permit to park in guest spots. Unfortunately for me, the office that hands out the parking permits was closed at the time of arrival. Joe decoded to just have me park at the edge of the lot where parking was not labeled. Now, the complex does have the assigned parking spots as well as office parking properly labeled as such, but at the end of the complex there is a section of 15-25 spots of 'open' parking. I'm assuming which is designated for guests. So I decided that it'd be fine for one night. It's around 1130pm (which I do have proof of) and according to my receipt of the tow, my vehicle was taken at 1159pm. \n\nMy problem is that according to California Vehicle code 22953 section a)  \"An owner or person in lawful possession of private property that is held open to the public, or a discernible portion thereof, for parking of vehicles at no fee, or an employee or agent thereof, shall not tow or remove, or cause the towing or removal, of a vehicle within one hour of the vehicle being parked.\"\n\nDo I have anything here that can hold up in small claims court?

We have a healthy sex-life and she's not afraid to be confident, and whenever I'm affectionate to her(on the street, in public) she doesn't hold back, but she never makes that move to be the first to do anything.  She never goes for a kiss first, it's always me that controls that.

It upset me and I thought that she didn't really think anything of it.  I also wrote her a long note before I left, talking about how much our relationship means to me, and she just kind of said thank you and kept going with her life.  I know that she cares about me, but she does not show any kind of thankfulness or affection towards me to actually show me that she cares about me.  Is this something that I should just take as part of her personality and not try to change, and maybe we're just different in the way that we show our gratitude and affection?

(Her glasses don't help much either). To make matters worse I am an incredibly sensitive person who is easily affected by things such as tone and word choice. So naturally if she's tired, or hungry or sick I misinterpret the living hell of of it an fall into an anxiety spiral. \n\nI ask her what's wrong.\n\nShe says nothing she's fine. \n\nJust \"fine\"?\n\nShe says she's okay \n\nI don't believe her on account of the visual and audio cues I'm receiving and continue to press which only leads to making her actually upset (which she wasn't before). \n\nNow, I intellectually understand she's not upset it's just that circumstance and natural disposition are mucking up my interpretation of her words/actions;  especially at this point since we've had a couple discussions about it.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dogs\nTITLE: I think my dog (a miniature schnauzer) is having seizures/muscle problems, and my parents won't take him to the vet. Help?\nPOST: Hello, I didn't know where else to go with this, but I am concerned for my dog's health.\n\nI would say for at least six months (I have been away at college for most of it) my dog has had contractions of the body when he is lying down. I have watched videos of dog seizures on youtube but all of them are severe ones that do not match my dogs behavior. It does not happen every time he lies down, but it happens AT LEAST once or twice a day.\n\nWhat will happen is my dog will be laying on his side, and then his whole body will seem to contract. He will draw his paws in toward his body or extend them outwards. His torso will seem to contract as well, almost bending him in half. During this he releases a sound like if he were stretching, but there is just a \"look\" in his eyes that seems as though he is under stress. These kind of contractions can last for a few seconds, stop, and then he will have another set of contractions. His breathing is labored in between and after. I don't think they last for more than a minute, and then they will stop. After that he shakes his head and seemingly returns to normal, though he pants afterwards.\n\nI can touch him during these events and it seems to calm his contractions a bit but it doesn't stop them, really. He breathes heavily, and then as soon as I lift my hand they return to their full strength.\n\nI unfortunately do not have a video of him, and cannot find a video online that is similar to his behavior. But his behavior does not seem right. My mom thinks that he is just stretching his body but it seems to be more to me. Am I over-reacting? Should I try to convince my parents to take him to the vet? They are worried about the cost of the vet, I think, and so do not want to take him if not \"necessary\".\nTL;DR:"}

However, he ended a six-year relationship in early May and chaos has followed ever since. To clarify, I met him on Tinder and the only expectation either of us had was to have a short fling (I recently ended a relationship too), but it developed into much more. We are crazy about each other and have been dating pretty seriously for the past 8 weeks.\n\nWhat makes me most uncomfortable is his newly ended relationship. I have absolutely no contact with my ex; he tried to contact me and I told him not to call me again. My SO is different; his ex constantly calls him in tears and tries to manipulate him into coming over. She relies on him very much still and understandably hasn't gotten over their time together (and likely won't for a long time), which would be okay except it is intruding very much into my relationship with him. The breaking point for me was last night, when she happened to pass us in the car and ended up being physically violent towards him. She didn't know about me and he still has not told her we've been dating regularly. \n\nI should add that the two of us aren't exclusive yet. The reason we haven't progressed to exclusivity is because I want these issues resolved before starting a relationship. He assures me he's ready, but these encounters tell me it's way too soon. I feel like he won't be ready to date for at least a few months, and that I should just find someone else. I don't approve of the way he handles his ex, but don't feel the situation is as black and white as it seems. They have a long history and I know it'll take some time to figure out. To ask him to cut off all contact does not seem realistic or fair.\nTL;DR:"}

Over the past year I've gained a bit of weight and now I'm around 160. I noticed that my GF seemed less enthusiastic about sex and had started dropping hints about how she'd like me to lose weight. Teasing me about eating snacks, asking me how often I work out, sending me pics of super skinny guys that she thinks are hot. She didn't do this before.\n\nLast week I bit the bullet and asked her if she found my weight gain unattractive. She answered simply: yes, she did, and she was much more attracted to me when I was underweight.\n\nMy first reaction was that that's a little bit crazy. \n\nBut I felt guilty. My GF works hard to stay attractive to me. She does lots of cardio, eats healthy, pays attention to makeup and clothes... she even keeps her hair short because I find that attractive. I'd have to admit that if she suddenly gained a lot of weight, my attraction to her would suffer -- but that would be if she went from thin to fat, not from super skinny to thin/average...

He will say he's in class, when she will see him in his car or sitting with his friends. \n\nToday he ignored her all morning until we saw him in the library and he had to sit with us because he couldn't get out without Mia seeing him. A little while later, he said he had to go to class, but passed him on our way to get food. On the way back, he was gone. Mia saw him sitting in his car when she went to her car, and he drove away as fast as possible when he saw her. This is just an example of a few times this has happened. \n\nBrad is also like two different people when he's alone with her or in a group. She has told me he's amazing when they are alone. But when its in public like at school or work, he gives her a cold shoulder, sometimes avoids her, and when he is forced to sit with her and someone else like he did today in the library, he will sit there quietly and sometimes ignore everything she says until he has a way out.\n\nMia really likes Brad. It has been a long time since I've seen her this happy with anyone. But as any of her friends know, there is one rule when Mia is involved: never lie to Mia, because she hates being lied to and will always find out. This has really upset her, because she can't handle being lied to like that especially by someone who has made her really happy lately.\n\nNeither of us can tell if he is hiding something, or if he's just oblivious to all of it.

Holidays hit and I was more flexible with my diet (read: ate everything in site) and gained a few lbs back. No big deal, I still look and feel good. So that's all fine. I obviously know how to lose weight.\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nMy work is starting an 8-week weight loss challenge beginning January 25. I've already lost a lot of weight. This challenge is measured by body fat reduction using an Inbody machine we have available to us. There is significant monetary rewards in place (1st prize is $1200). More importantly I feel like this challenge will help me stay motivated to lose the remainder of my body fat (was 31% in November). This is also a group effort so I feel like my team can help motivate each other (I wouldn't want to be the responsible party not holding up my end of the deal come final weigh in etc.)\n\nHere's my question to all of you lovely folks (and possible ex-wrastlers):\n\nI'm not looking to cheat by any means. I'm just looking to use the natural fluctuation of weight to my advantage. It's got me down several times in the past (I'm looking right at you Hickory Farms sausage and cheese platter) but this time I want to use that to benefit us. I'm only writing here because I feel like I'm already at a disadvantage to my team because I did most of my weight loss last year. I still have body fat to lose but is there anything that can be done to increase my initial weigh in? I read eat hella salty foods the day before (yay sausage). And maybe drink extra water?

About two months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years. We had a great run, but we just felt things weren't working romantically anymore, but we're still practically best friends. Now here's where it gets weird; we were together for 5 years, from 14 to 19, but we never had sex. We did pretty much everything else, oral/touching etc, but never actual penetration. This is because she's a Mormon. A pretty liberal/casual one; hence the other stuff, and she does other things Mormon's aren't supposed to do too, but one thing she always drew the line at was sex before marriage. And I respected that, because I loved her. Of course I wished so much that she didn't have that belief, but I got past it because we had a great relationship even without it. \n\nNow that we've broken up, on good terms, I just want to have sex. But I'm scared that I'll come across as inexperienced. If you're 20 and just broke up from a 5 year relationship, people would usually expect that you'd have experience. Plus our lack of sex wasn't exactly common knowledge. I'm starting my second year of university next week (same university as my ex funnily enough) and I really just want to get out there and find a sexual partner, whether it be just a hook up, a casual relationship, or another long term relationship. I don't mind. But I worry that people are gonna think I'm more experienced than I am. Plus ever since we broke up, I've become incredibly self conscious about my appearance; something I've never felt before. I've started going to the gym, so hopefully that'll help put that feeling to rest, but it's still not helping in terms of my confidence with finding someone new. \n\nIn addition to this, I worry that maybe trying to find someone so soon might damage my friendship with my ex. I don't think she plans to find anyone new just yet, but I worry about making her jealous if I do. I know I shouldn't be worried about this, but I still am. She's still my best friend, and I want to keep it that way.\nTL;DR:"}

This also happened when I was in high school, over 6 years ago. So if this is removed, I'll understand.\n\nOne summer day, a coworker/bro and I decided to go hiking in a wooded area/nature preserve in the middle of a small city close to OKC. Later that day we were supposed to both attend a mandatory meeting and decided a short hike down a mile or so trail and back would be cool and then we would go to said meeting. Well, cue FU which I guess is less of a FU and more of an I unfortunate situation. We're halfway on the return trip walking down the trail and I have a sudden urge to go # 2. I try to hold it in and walk slower and with careful deliberation such as if walking on ice. I tell my coworker/friend that I'm having troubles and jokingly say I may not make it. Soon after I become more serious and tell him to just walk ahead and I'll catch up. Cue me, stepping just off the trail to drop my pants and do as nature does and leave a steamy pile for the flies and whatever else may come down the trail. Also, with no TP and not wanting to risk using the wrong leaf(accidental poison ivy on my chocolate maker, I go commando after using my boxers.\nTL;DR:"}

Should I (a) ask via text so she has time to think about her response? or (b) ask via skype so I can see her initial response to the question?\nPOST: I'll try to make the backstory as concise as possible.\n\nA little over a 10 months ago, the girl of my dreams moved across the country to Seattle. We've kept in touch during this time, and she knows how I feel about her (well, somewhat. She knows I have feelings for her, but doesn't quite know the extent to which I'm in love with her). The truth is, I've never felt this way about someone before and I sincerely feel like she is *the girl* for me. I also get the sense she feels similarly.\n\nFor about the past 6 months, I've been in contact with a new brewery that wants me to serve as their VP of sales and distribution. However, that opportunity seems unlikely now that the brewery is experiencing some initial troubles getting opened. Until this recent development, I've been extremely excited about moving to Seattle, being in the same city as her, and then seeing where things end up - all while not having to force her hand and ask explicitly if she harbors the same feelings as me.\n\nThat being said, with this new news, I'm still wondering if I should search for employment out in Seattle. It's highly unlikely I'll find an opportunity out there as enticing as my previous prospect, so I would like to know if there's a chance of things working out between us before I make a serious commitment to move.\n\nWhich brings me to my question. What would be the better form of asking her? Via text or fb message to give her time to think about it? or via skype so I can see how she reacts to the question? Ladies, which would you prefer? Thanks for the advice.\nTL;DR:"}

After reading it me and my friend couldn't stop laughing, and as soon as we stopped laughing one of us would giggle a little bit a we would just start laughing hysterically to the point where we had tears in our eyes. Since we were suppose to read that lesson and everyone else was completely quiet we decided to try to force ourselves to stop. This is where the FU occured. In order to stop laughing we googled \"starving african children\" to make us sad instead. It didn't work and we just kept laughing. That's when our teacher came up behind us to see what we were giggling at... To him it looked like we were laughing at the children.

When we first moved in landlord and I could talk easily and she even asked me to babysit her unborn son (currently 4 months). We were on really good terms until about a month ago. \n\nIt was a comfortable day and my daughter (2 years) and I had just gotten back from the grocery store. I ran inside to put money on the laundry card and the landlord joked about my husband taking care of our daughter. I should have just laughed it off but I mentioned that I had left her in the car for a moment. At the time I didn't think anything of it, did what I had to do, and ran back outside. I was inside for less than 2 minutes, the same song was playing on the radio when I returned to my car. \n\nI have only spoken to her twice since then, however both times that I have, she won't look me in the eye, she's short with me, and seems to have a chip on her shoulder. Maybe I should have mentioned that my daughter had the radio, AC, and the doors were locked but I honestly I didn't think it was a big deal or that it was particularly her business.\n\nThis probably shouldn't worry me, however I am concerned it may affect our chances of leasing for another year. Or, even worse, that she may try to report me to CPS. She's a little bit out there; doesn't believe in vaccines or abortion, both of which I have very strong opposing position on. However I have never said anything contrary to her opinion. Mainly because of this very issue.\n\nI'm sure that I have not given her any other reason to have an issue with me other than this. Its kind of unprofessional for her act like this with a renter at all. It almost seems like I said something to offend her personally but I am not sure what else it could be. \n\nSo what I am asking is what is the best way for me to inquire about her problem with me without compromising our position to least another year or getting too personal.

Recently while going out with friends, I was in a bad mood - not due to anything in particular as far as I can tell, I just felt quite gloomy. My boyfriend told me that I should just \"cheer up\"; and also that my bad mood was ruining the mood of others around me.

On one hand, I think perhaps he does have a point - maybe I AM just limiting myself and I could be cheered up if I thought that way - but on the other hand, when I'm upset just 'cheering up' isn't something I can do.

We're both virgins) she has been feeling guilty about anything that makes her orgasm. She is excited for our sex after marriage, and up until this point she's been wonderfully adventurous and engaged even though she has a lower libido than me.\n\nShe's offered to still give me oral and do whatever I still need, but she's off limits. To me, I don't enjoy sex when it's solely about me, so basically we're not going to have any sexual contact for four months.\n\nShe really wants me to stop looking at porn too, and I've been onboard giving it up for my own personal reasons, but it seems like the next few months are going to be really rough now.\n\nI guess my only real question is if anyone has been in a similar situation? How they handled going without sex when you have an incredibly attractive SO sleeping next to you and constantly turning you on. How can I stop from blaming her when I want to support a decision that's important to her?\n\nI don't need any advice about dumping her. I don't think we're going to have a sexless marriage based on our sexual activity up to this point. We're both pretty experienced sexually in everything outside of PIV and have had multiple partners.\nTL;DR:"}

I sat down, talked to her and its like we never stopped talking. I really started to like this girl. She liked all of the same off-the-wall things that I did. I constantly found myself saying \"Where have you been all of my life.\" She tells me that she is interested in one of our leads. We were both 18, he was 27. I hated the idea of it.  The two of them become friends with benefits and she tells me she found out he was 36. She doesn't seem to care though, she keeps fucking him.\n\nAfter a little while she starts \"cheating\" on him with me. I had no idea what I was supposed to do. All of my friends tell me to leave her alone and move on. So I did. After about 3 weeks she tells me that she ended things with our lead and that she misses me a lot. I was so happy, we got together 2 days later.\n\nAll we did was work, and then hang out with each other for a year and a half. She didn't like the fact that I had so many friends that were girls and she would get really jealous whenever I hung out with them. So I stopped.

I have struggled with weight for most of my teen and adult years, and have successfully lost a large amount (35lbs) of weight once on Weight Watchers when I was 20. Since then, I gained all of it back plus about 10lbs. 2 years ago I was nearly 200lbs and diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. I changed my eating habits again and got down to around 165lbs, but gained a little back over the winter. \n\nI'm using MFP and doing CICO. I just want to make sure I am not eating too many calories, so I want to run my plan past you guys. Any advice is greatly appreciated! \n\nI calculated my TDEE as a sedentary person, because I do have a desk job. Cutting 500 calories a day would put my at 1274 calories per day. I also let MFP do it's thing, and if I say I want to lose 1lb per week, it suggests 1380. \n\nWith that in mind, I am not actually a sedentary person. I bike 6-10 miles a day, 5 days a week, I take a yoga class once a week, and I walk my dog. I track the exercise in MFP, and I will usually eat SOME of the calories \"earned\" by activity, but not all.\nTL;DR:"}

She's toxic and both my siblings have distanced the wrong way for the right reasons. My two older siblings are lovable and fun but not caregivers, they are very selfish. So I've been the one calming my mom down and taking care of her my whole life, it's gotten in the way of a lot of opportunities for me.

What accidental responsibilities have been dumped on you that nobody intended?\nPOST: In case anyone's wondering how that happened: I had just gotten my Amateur Radio License, and was asking my parents (who also both had theirs) what I'm ever going to do with this.  There aren't a lot of other 9-year-old amateur radio operators for me to talk to, and the older people just weren't interested in the same things as me.  My parents feel kind of bad about this because I had been studying for over a year to earn this license, and obviously wasn't enjoying the reward.  Not a good lesson; I grew up to be lazy.  They were both already Emergency Communications Specialists for my church (not just my own congregation, there were around 8 specialists for the local group of congregations surrounding my city and the adjacent ones).  They decided to get me onto our church's amateur radio emergency communications network, and also started taking me to their meetings.  Fast forward a couple of months.  Someone notices that I'm on their roll for these meetings and assumes that I'm a responsible adult.  He also notices that besides attending these meetings I have no other duties, and don't appear on any of their records.  Since only Emergency Communication Specialists attend these meetings, I'm suddenly on record as an Emergency Communication Specialist.  I'm also assigned a few duties, among them being backup check-in coordinator for the network I had just joined!  My parents were both amused; I was not.  They didn't say anything, and I was too socially awkward to object to all these people way older than me.  I carried out my duties for about 6 months before someone realized what had happened and let me go.  In retrospect, that's terribly funny.  At the time I was terrified.\nTL;DR:"}

Now the part I kinda regret is that I make way more money than she does and since the break up she has been struggling financially so even while we were on a break I used to give her money and buy her stuff. Today when I told her that I am going No Contact I gave her a check of $2,500 to pay off her credit card debt since I will not be seeing her for quiet a while and won't be giving her any more money.\n\nAm I too stupid for doing that ? I know I don't owe her shit and since she is seeing a new guy now (who she says she already has feelings for) then why won't that guy give her money instead ?! Aaaaah please help me!\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I tell him to spend more time with me but when he does, I push him away.\nPOST: Boyfriend and I have been together 2 years. He started getting back into gaming approx. 9 months into our relationship. Beforehand, we would spend **all** our time together, as a couple in their honeymoon stage would. When he got into gaming, I really didn't mind. It gave me a chance to get study done and it made him happy. As time went on, he played more and more; to the point where we were not spending any quality time together and I'd travel to see him for the weekend just to end up studying. I talked to him about it, he didn't realize it was upsetting me and agreed to spend more time with me. \n\nNow, here's the problem. When I hear his computer start up, my heart sinks and I get worked up and angry about it but carry on with my thing, wishing we would be doing something together. After a bit of gaming, he comes and asks me if there's anything I'd like to do with him and as much as I'd like to, I always push him away and tell him to go back to his games and I don't feel like doing anything. I believe the reason why I do this is underlying from my past relationship where everything seemed perfect and he had never, ever done anything to upset me until one day he left me for no reason and years on I'm still not completely over it. I'd like to think that if my current bf was to dump me, it would be easy for me to get over him because he \"never spent time with me and always playing games, neglecting me, being a jerk and didn't treat me right\".\n\n I really don't want to feel like this anymore but don't know how to get over it.\nTL;DR:"}

He goes on vacations with her, takes her out for dinner and invites her to his parties. The girlfriends that I dream about are very pretty, but they are not very nice to me. They tell me that I don't deserve him, that I am too ugly and stupid to be with him. They sometimes laugh at me. I also dream about fighting both of them, but I always lose. I wake up crying, and it's hard not to think about this dream for the rest of the day.\n\nI know I'm not that bad, and I don't think that he could change into a perfect boyfriend. I don't regret breaking up with him. But there still is that little voice in the back of my mind saying that I didn't deserve him.\n\nWe still talk sometimes, because he still owes me a lot of money. And I still care about him, or I think that I do. I'm not sure.. \nI don't look at his facebook, instagram or twitter anymore. Because if he has a new girlfriend, it's better for me not to know about it.\n\nI would like to meet someone again, but I don't think that I'm ready.

When we met he was studying in college but since then, has left, been unemployed and is now working.\n\nDuring the time in which he was unemployed and prior to his pay beginning (he had to work 3 months before he could be paid) I have paid for everything. Food, date nights and additionally I would buy him gifts. He was unhappy he couldn't return this behaviour.\n\nHe now works and is paid monthly, but the amount is variable to the amount of jobs he does. His boss decides who goes on what jobs. This means his pay can range from a few hundred to a few thousand.\n\nI am so tired of covering him financially. It is sucking all the enjoyment out of the relationship and we now argue over it often. No matter how much I budget, I cannot put any money in savings and as someone who has no one but myself to rely on, this makes me worry. My boyfriends reassurance is that he is getting a large pay next month, but this doesn't help with bills now, mostly food. I am also losing hope that he ever will cover his share. I'm starting to want to leave.\n\nI feel like I've conveyed my point terribly, but I'm currently upset from yet another fight this morning as we are due to go shopping.

It ended up in this huge argument where she was yelling about how my roommate was just jealous because she was fat and my gf was a fit girl. I was horrified by it and I ended it that day and things blew up from there.\n\nIt turns out it was never about my roommate's bra, but I'm kind of stupid when it comes to stuff like this and never would have figured that out. \n\nSince then I hear a lot of rumors abut me, how I hooked up with my roommate (I didn't, she is in a relationship with my other roommate and they're very happy). How I'm a \"chubby chaser\" and all sorts of bad things. \n\nWe're blocked on social media, and I don't get her texts, but I don't know how to handle this. We run in the same program at school and she spends a lot of time badmouthing me to everyone who will listen.

That aside we had an okay break up, no breakup is great but no huge drama. We still saw each other here and there and still got along for a while after. Anyway, Pete's new girlfriend, let's call her \"Bella\". Both Pete and Bella are redditors. After losing contact with Pete for a bit I found out from one of my redditor friends that Bella used work as a sex worker in a brothel as a specialised hooker for people who like her certain... features. I didn't believe it for a while but apparently he saw some advertisements for her 'work' on reddit and some nude posts in r/gonewild which have all been deleted now. Another redditor I am good friends with even told me on the global reddit meetup day she took him to the brothel/strip club she used to work at and he had to refer to her as her hooker name inside. Firstly if he knows and is cool I don't want to be a home wrecker. But I just know he couldn't possibly be okay with it. I was with him for a while enough to tell that would turn him right off and freak him the fuck out. If he has accepted this I'm a bit offended I got traded for that deal but oh well.

Take the following, for example:\n\nThe dash on the end seems to suggest that this individual is beginning to say the word \"Fuck,\" with an exaggerated, extended emphasis on the beginning of the word, and not intending to abbreviate \"Fuck You\". Furthermore:\n\nThis face is a representation of beginning to pronounce just the \"F\" in \"Fuck\".

I don't really see the point.\nPOST: Okay, so my girlfriend and I have a pretty good sex life and since the start of our sexual relationship (6 months ago) we've only been using condoms. She's away right now, but we've decided that once she gets back she'll be on the oral contraceptive pill. \n\nSince this means that there's like a 99.9% chance that she won't get pregnant, I don't really see the need for me to use a condom. Whilst she understands that safety isn't an issue, she still feels somewhat insecure/unsafe about going bareback because there's no \"physical barrier\" as such and also feels a bit of a burden of responsibility on her part because it's her job to not forget to take the pill otherwise. She does think however that we can have sex without using a condom \"sometimes\" but mainly it would be with a condom.\n\nFrom my POV, this is a bit of a weird stance, because if she's uncomfortable with me not using a condom, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing what she suggested (i.e. occasionally going bareback) because I guess I'd feel a bit guilty - so I guess for me it's sort of an all-or-nothing thing with the condom yes/no situation. On the other hand, I would be lying if I said that sex felt the same with a condom for me. \n\nWhat do you guys thing we should do? I feel like ultimately it's basically her decision because she's the one taking the pill, but I do also kind of want to have sex without a condom for a few reasons (pleasure, intimacy, etc) - is that selfish of me? Anyway guys, please let me know what you think we should do. All suggestions are appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

She currently lives with her parents, so these two Devils live in the same house. \n\nNeither her or her parents have put more than a days effort into trying to train either of them. \n\nEver since I've known her, the eldest dog has completely lost his mind every time someone opens a door, or closes a door on the opposite side of the dog. Very recently, he's been nipping at your ankles as you're trying to leave the house. Usually, he will just rush at you barking and growling fiercely until the door is shut. But the new development of actual biting is what kind of threw me over the edge. (It's been an everlasting battle regardless...). He will also bark endlessly every time the A/C clicks on until you tell him to hush. Besides the constant barking, he's a very sweet dog and will get along with everyone as long as you let him sniff your hand or throw a toy for him at least once. \n\nThe new papillon, the show dog, has over the course of time adopted these same symptoms but turned out worse. Where the older dog will generally only bark when anyone touches the front door or bedroom doors, the younger dog will now rush at you and bark and growl regardless of what door you're opening/closing. Opening the bathroom door and stepping out is a serious offense to this little guy... \n\nEveryone in her house has mixed feelings about how you train a dog, and completely lacks the motivation to even begin training. We're all very tired of dealing with these issues, and nobody (including myself) has a clear idea of where to begin. \n\nCan somebody please help us? This madness needs to stop. Its making everyone extremely stressed, and we desperately need to know how to fix this.\n\nSorry if this seemed passive aggressive...

We broke up because we were too different and couldn't get along about very important topics like : \n\n* Family  : she couldn't stand my over protective mother, felt in competition. I tried to reassure her but it did not work.\n\n* Friendships : Me being the jealous type and her being the \"He tried to seduce me but it's been a year and now he wants to be friend so it's ok\" type of person.\n\n* Work : Her wanting a  career and me who doesn't give two f. about careers. I just want to travel the world and create a small web marketing company (I have a degree in software engineering).\n\nBut we went through all those issues during our first year of relationship and it went fine. I chose to postpone my \"travel dream\" for staying with her. We agreed we would travel together once she would have enough experience to be able to have high responsibility job anywhere.\n\nIt did not work as intended. Little by little each of us focused on their goals and we lost the friendship we had. We were not happy no more hence the break up.\n\nIt's been a month already and I feel we made a mistake. I feel empty as hell without her. I have projects and dreams for the future but I fear I won't find someone like her. We were really close, really friends and we could discuss about pretty much anything even if we didn't agree with each other. I know it's irrational but I can't think otherwise.\nHelp please.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [20/m] not sure whether to pursue friend [19/f]\nPOST: Pursue isn't the right word exactly. \n\nSo this last weekend, several of my friends and I all were drinking, and I had somewhat planned to tell my friend that I liked her, so once I hit my booze limit, if you will, I stopped because I was still pretty intact. She was a little more sober than I, but still a little tipsy. So I told her that I liked her, but the first time I didn't say whether I liked her, or LIKED her. However, I made it clear through several hugs, which are quite uncharacteristic of me, and walking with her, that I liked her. The part that I'm unsure about is that she really didn't seem to mind any of the hugs, and at one point, she actually admitted that she was a little mad that I wouldn't tell her how I liked her. I didn't make any moves or anything drastic like that. \n\nFast forward to the next night, she asked if I remembered what I did, and I said yes, and that I knew what I was doing. I still don't regret it. Out of curiosity of her reaction, before I went to bed, I asked if I should just keep my mouth shut next time, and without much hesitation, she said \"you do whatever you want\". She's a fairly shy person, even somewhat around her friends, so getting any kind of read is tough.\n\nIf I do anything, it won't be till we drink again next time, because any other time will make things too awkward for her. I know that much, but I feel like she kind of liked the attention if nothing else.\n\nMy question, finally, should I dig a little deeper next time, or leave it where it is and have fun?\nTL;DR:"}

A few months ago two members of my team were moved into the development team under the guise that they would be supporting some of the more technical aspects of the project and would be better suited to complete this role by being closer to development, it was emphasized by management that this was not a promotion or anything of that nature but in my heart I knew these guys would get more opportunities than myself. The issue is is that one of the guys started after me and although we basically do the same type of technical support he was 'assigned' an application that would require more advanced knowledge of javascript, apparently this was the criteria for which they based the move on, I believe I am equally if not more technical than him and he often asks me for assistance. \n\nFast forward a few months and now I have learned that they will essentially be training these guys up with qualifications that will enable them to become fully fledged DBA's, essentially putting them now first in the pecking order for moving into other roles within the business ahead of me. This has made me deeply unhappy as I feel this was a stealth promotion that I have been overlooked for purely because of one product I happen to not have been assigned.

This was an item needed for him to complete a certain task. Basically a super unfortunate combination of me messing, my roommate having a mental breakdown, and communication being diffult since I have no internet at my appartment and my phone was stolen last week ends up with him getting the item three hours later than he preferred and waiting outside the building for me to open the door for 15 mins since I didn't see his email. Super annoying and frustrating for him - I totally  understand that, and feel super sad I let him down and apologized profously. I do not, however understand his anger and in general have a problem relating to this feeling. If the roles were reversed I'd have felt sadness instead - like he was letting me down as a friend.\n\nFor me to feel angry someone seriously has to do me a great injustice with malicous intent. Other feelings (love, hapiness, sadness and so on) I understand and feel just fine - maybe even stronger than most. But I seriously cannot remember the last time I was angry at a person - I just get sad instead. Therefore I assume subconciously that people will hate me forever and never want to speak to me again when they treat me with anger, which is unsurprisingly rather hard to deal with.\n\nSo I guess I'd like some input to understand what it is like to feel anger more often. Why does it bother people so much and why do thay react outward with anger instead of inward with sadness? And most importantly how does it stop, and when?\nTL;DR:"}

I was a huge dreamer and was working hard towards securing a creative, much-less viable career. \n\nHe was a nice, shy man, who had his life in order (great job, new car, eyes set on buying a house). Somehow underneath all that, he secretly wanted to pursue a different, also more creative career but just never had the guts to go after it (which he has said was what attracted him to me in the first place). \n\nLong story short... The past few years I have been trying (and often failing) to land my dream job, and he has started to pursue his. My failed attempts have taken its toll on me and my overall spirit. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety about getting older and still not having a \"real job\" and feeling like I haven't been able to contribute. His reasons for breaking it off have been vague, but the more I think about it, the more I feel like my depression, and lack of direction and independence may have been a big factor. \n\nI guess my issue is the more I go out, meet people and just try to build a new life without him, all I end up doing is seeing all of these women, who have real jobs, make their own money and actually look super confident and more importantly, mentally stable. Hah!

I usually dealt with it in the past by just blocking it out of my head and telling myself she loves me.

(Cross post from r/rlationship_advice)\nPOST: If you look at my previous posts you can see that I'm in a long term relationship and haven't been happy for a while. The sex ended months ago and it now feels just like we are roommates who chasteley kiss occasionally.\nI've been thinking for a long time about ending it but have finally decided to do it, only problem is is that we live in a 1 bed apartment and still have 6 months left on our lease. Both names are on the lease and neither of us can afford to rent the apartment solo. So basically if we end things now we will be stuck living together for 6 months which would be awkward as hell r.e moving on. I just feel that if I did end it now she would either find some way to lure me back (one last fling and whoops she is pregnant) and keep me there or she would spend 6 months making me miserable\nWould it be horrible if I just let things continue and broke it off before our lease expires? We aren't sleeping together and she hardly shows any affection so it won't be like I'm leading her on. Also I will get a large bonus just before our lease expires which I would give her half of so she can make a fresh start to and not have to go back and live at home and be miserable.\nWe have tried counselling and she hated it and I have made every effort to make things better but she just can't be bothered, the only solution is to end it.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel so terrible. \n\nHe will be telling me how bored he is and I just think to myself 'huh maybe bang your wife?'.\n\nI told him that the constant rejection hurt but he gets reeally mad and says it's not 'rejection' and me seeing it that way makes him more unwilling.\n\nI cry myself to sleep now sometimes. I never ever ever reject him. I just wish he'd be into me again :\\. \n\nAnd yah I probably come off as clingy but I keep this to myself most of the time. I've tried to talk about it.

What to do?\nPOST: So I'm a freshman in college (19 year old female) and I think I've always known that I was queer. I've always had a kind of deep attraction to girls and I've been fine with it. Being bisexual was easy for me, and I only really started embracing it in college.\n\nBut I met this guy at the very beginning of the year and we've been dating since October (7 months). He's become my best friend, has supported me through one of my most difficult times, loves me no matter what. He's okay with my bisexuality and is even okay that I'm struggling right now.\n\nHowever, it's gotten the point where I'm becoming less and less attracted to him *not* because he's unattractive but because I'm becoming more attracted to girls in general. Like, I can't get off when we're together and can only be turned on sexually when watching lesbian porn or thinking about girls I've hooked up with in the past.\n\nHe knows how hard I'm struggling with this and he still loves me and is supporting me, telling me to talk to people at our local LGBT resource center and whatnot, but it's getting to the point where I'm questioning not only my sexuality and the very fiber of who I am, but it's seriously affecting our relationship. He knows how I feel and doesn't want to break up, but a.) I'm not getting what I want from him sexually right now and b.) I feel like it's totally unfair to him.\n\nI think the crux of the issue here is that I don't know whether I should break up with him or if we should stay together, because honestly, I am in love with him romantically but don't feel any sexual attraction to him (or males in general, at the moment) at all. That being said, my sexuality has a tendency to be very fluid and bounces around between being attracted to girls more or guys more at different times. It's just been particularly severe for quite a while now. Should I wait it out and try to get help or break up with him and risk losing him so that I can figure it out on my own?\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I live together, work from home together, see each other a lot, so when baseball season starts I get seriously neglected, as well as his hygiene and manners.  He is normally so sweet and considerate, but everything changes when it's time for a \"draft\" or to conspire with his team co-captain or whatever.  If I have the slightest question, concern or need he either ignores me or takes this tone in his voice that makes me sick to my stomach.  I tell him this, and he blatantly doesn't care.  He thinks I'm being selfish because I have my own activities he's not involved in, but jeez I don't spend 8+ hours ignoring the world doing my hobbies.  And when I do I take it out of the house.  I make a point of getting out of the house for more than just meals.

We were meeting Alex for the first time however, he and I had been texting off and on since Christmas when he asked for my help choosing a present for Lily.  Alex enjoys smoking and John knew this.\n\nTowards the end of the weekend I was talking to Alex and he tells me about a conversation he and John had.  Apparently John said can I ask you something and you not tell Lily and Abby? Has Abby smoked anything with you this weekend? Alex tells him no and John seemed satisfied with that.  Alex told me this because he considers us friends and had just met John.  \n\nThis is not the first time he has asked someone if I have smoked.  My brother (21, lives nearby) smokes often and has been quizzed by John if I ever smoked with him (shortly after we moved here).  I'm not sure what to do with this or how/if I should approach John with this information.  Obviously he has some sort of trust issue although if I ever bring up trust he insists he trusts me implicitly.  I'm appalled that he asked Alex, considering they just met this weekend.

I tell this to my new, freshman roommate (we share 1 room) this year about these issues I had with my previous one regarding my privacy (going through my things) and being messy (leaving condom wrappers on floor). She agrees, saying it's disrespectful. \n\nOn Halloween, her bf comes over and I'm awake and on my laptop... and then they started having sex. I confronted her the next morning and we argued. She denied it saying they were getting \"comfortable\". She then avoids me the entire next week and comes back Friday  (11/8/13) but only enters the room when I'm either a) sleeping or b) not in the room. I leave for the weekend and later that night I see her  tagged on Facebook in one of my sweatshirts at a hockey game. I didn't know it was mine FOR SURE until I came back this Monday night and see my sweatshirt is gone from where I left it. I remember because I washed and folded it Thursday night. \n\nToday, I see new photos of her with her boyfriend **IN THAT SWEATSHIRT**. It's funny because after we argued her bf says he wants a sweatshirt like mine. I confront her, and she says, \"What sweatshirt?\" \"No, I haven't even been in here.\"\n\nI can prove it's mine because I have pictures of me in it from 1 year ago (when I bought it) and I just looked and I have the bank statement from when I bought it. I can probably call up the store I bought it from and ask if they still sell it or something.\n\nI already talked to my CA about it and all three of us are supposed to talk about the problems going.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been dating for almost 2 months now, and I asked her to be my girlfriend exactly a week ago. She seems like a great girl, and was very excited to say yes, so I was ecstatic.\n\nTo start off I should mention that she's always connected to some form of social media. I'm constantly getting text messages, facebook messages, and snapchats all day, every day, but at the same time she seems really shy and scared to talk on the phone. I usually only call her to set up date plans, and then she's hasty to get off the phone. It's usually me setting up plans to hang out and I already see myself pulling most of the weight.\n\nSomething's happening right now that's really bothering me and making me question a few things I shrugged off before. I thought this was kind of communication was weird before but today she's gone completely dark on me. She texted me a \"What are you up today this fine day!\" I responded back within a few minutes and asked her about her what she was doing. Then I asked another question an hour later. We're going on hour 5 now without a response. Maybe I've gotten used to getting a response back within a timely fashion (< 30 min), or maybe this is making me notice some red flags. She didn't strike me as the kind of girl to play games, but maybe she's testing me.\n\nIt's REALLY early on in the relationship and I'm scared of coming off as needy...I feel like I am being needy, and I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. I'm not really sure what to do, or if I should even do anything. \n\nI've considered sending her a facebook message or calling her, but I don't want to dig the hole deeper, ya know? What should I do? Should I just go cold on her, and wait for her to get back to me?\nTL;DR:"}

Also, how to deal with it..\n\nPrior to this, they always talked about how hot I was, how I look like I belong in New York City, etc. I usually was super awkward about it.\nI always get hit on by guys when we go out (albeit very creepy guys). I also get things for free at restraunts/bars because the workers soemtimes will say \"on the house\" or give me a discount.\n\nAnyways, at a bar I asked for an energy drink since I was tired. The bartender said I didn't have to pay. All of my friends kept saying \"oh it's probably just because it wasn't alcohol\". They always kind of seem to downplay that.. Not that I want them to say \"oh its because you're so attractive!!\" but it's annoying that they always try to find an explanation for why I get some things for free.\n\nWhat is even more annoying, is that I really have feelings for one of our guy friends. We kind of have a \"special connection\" of some sorts. Where he always is by me and talks to me and seems generally, really into me. He is super awkward and not too much of a person to open up, but I kind of get him to open up. My friends are ALWAYS all over him when we go out, despite knowing that I like him. They talk about how they recently bonded etc. One of them openly flirts with him too.\n\nThey also downplay everything he does for me. He goes way out of his way for me, and they say he is just being nice and he's a great friend. I feel like they should be giving some of that typical girl support of \"he really likes you!\" etc. like they always have in the past.\nTL;DR:"}

We didn't get touchy feely or anything which is fine by me, however it did get pretty late so she crashed at my place on a mattress on the floor. The day after I saw a post on a yik yak type app (anonymous posting) which was exactly what I did yesterday and the consensus of the post was that she thinks gentlemen exist. She doesn't know that I have seen it, however I do think she hoped that I would since we actually met each other through that app as strange as it might sound.\n\nI would say my demands for a girlfriend are very high and I want to feel really attracted to someone if I want to date someone with the intention of getting a girlfriend. I just don't see myself being with her like that right now. At the moment I feel like she is way more attracted to me than I am to her and I don't want to lead her on. I'm very conflicted on how to go about this since I could see myself having a FWB relationship with her however I don't want her to think I just wanted to have sex with her because I went on the dates with the intention of a possible relationship. \n\nI am not sure how to go about this and I need some advice. In my opinion dating is for finding out if you like someone but I'm not sure if it's morally right more me to go on another date anymore. Is there any good way to say I just want to be FWB or should I just let it go entirely and tell her I just want to be friends? Not sure how she would take the FWB proposition because both of us seem to be kind of conservative...\nTL;DR:"}

My morals are strongly against anything that has to do with alcohol.\n\nAnother point I brought up is that I switched it around. I said, \"If you didn't like my occasional bottle or glass, I would stop because I know you don't like it.\" Should she have done the same for me, or are my expectations flawed?\n\nDid I do the right thing?

The problem was that her being my girlfriend was nothing how I had hoped. She had been abused by her father at a young age and as such had intimacy issues that ultimately led to the demise of our relationship after 6 months. Essentially she wasnt attracted to me because mainly \"assholes\" turned her on (her words) and I was not an asshole.\n\nBreaking up was very difficult and we never spoke again. A couple months later I slept with a good friend of hers because the opportunity arose, we had not dated in a long time, and my ex wasnt even attracted to me in the first place so I thought nothing of it, but apparently it made her furious.\n\nAnyway, almost a year later (last night) we sort of ran into each other through a gathering of mutual friends. We were at the same dinner, and at one point we were in the same room alone for a short time but neither of us uttered a word, we just ignored each other like neither existed.\n\nI dont know, I guess I sort of miss my old best friend and want to reconcile things, but after the moment last night that doesnt seem like a good idea.

It's better. It's easy, even though life can be stressful. To be honest, life is less stressful with the other person around. It's better. I'm a better person with her around and I know it--even though it takes a lot to admit. We both recognize this as being different, and are both shocked at our approach given that we're both so historically independent.\n\nAnyway, by now, we've met each other's families, we've made plans for the next several months (into next year) and generally see the other person as part of the both near and distant future. I anticipate our parents meeting within the next couple weeks (though a specific plan hasn't been set).\n\nIs it too soon to be thinking engagement?

Initially, I was convinced I should take it home, but while trying to transport it, every passing car would frighten it back into its hideout.  While going home to find a box to bring it, I realized I could only keep it outside because of an allergic roommate.\n\nNow, I don't have any issues with keeping a cat outside and feeding it, but my concern is that I will not be living here very long and moving back to the city soon where I would be unable to keep it outside any longer.  I don't think socializing a cat to live outdoors and then moving it indoors is a wise decision, especially for how little I know of taking care of any animals.  I don't know of anybody looking for a cat and I'm not sure I can find one (though I think I'll advertise, anyway, if the cat is still there when I get home).\n\nSo my last thought is that it likely has a mother cat taking care of it, considering it looked too young to have an owner and too old to be abandoned by its mother at birth.  My reasoning was, a mother cat will likely take better care of it than I will, and properly raise it.\n\nWhat would you do, Reddit?  I'm kind of torn up about this moral dilemma since I don't really know much about taking care of cats.

My parents have put in a great deal of emotional investment, and so if possible I would want them to have to worry about me as little as possible.\nI've recently gotten a girlfriend, and things seem to be going smoothly.  I thought this would be a good time to introduce my girlfriend to my parents since things between my brother have been looking good.  However, about a week ago, things have become worse than they have in the past (I won't go into details).  My parents are the sort that worry extensively about our futures, and so I don't want them to invest anything more into wondering if my girlfriend is good for me, etc.  It would bring about unncecessary stress, and I don't think they can handle worrying about the both of us at the same time.\nObviously, I could just date her without telling them, but I feel that this is extremely rude to both my parents and my girlfriend, and I think it would make both parties unhappy in the end.  I'm conflicted about what to do.\nSorry for being long-winded.\nTL;DR:"}

After the ceremony at the reception, my former military, normally very stereotypically \"manly\" boyfriend, started sobbing out of nowhere. Crying for an several minutes, ugly-cry-face kind of crying. I was alarmed because 1) I think I had only seen him cry once prior to that and 2) he is not usually emotional in any way in public. I asked what was wrong and if he was alright and and he said \"If anything happens to [best friend], I will have to take care of [best friend's new wife].\" \n\nI found this answer very strange and asked what he meant and he said that I \"didn't understand\" and continued crying. His best friend is also former military and I totally get that the fear that something could happen to him, leaving his new wife without a husband, would be concerning...but he's not in the military anymore. He works a normal job that isn't dangerous. Boyfriend seemed to be in despair rather than coming from a place of fear.\n\nSomething seemed off about the reaction and I have become concerned that he has feelings for his best friend's wife. He has always been close to her and is very complementary of her all the time, almost as though she can do no wrong in his eyes. Am I making too much of this? I feel a little silly and am not sure if it's worth bringing up, but it's been nagging at me a little.\nTL;DR:"}

I am in contact with my SO multiple times daily as this is our way of coping with the distance. Lately I've been hanging out a lot with my good male friend [22m] in university who I've known for years (only been with the SO for three months). There is nothing beyond friendship between me and this friend (we'll call him J) as he is gay. However, when J came out to me about a year ago it was a total surprise to me and he told me I absolutely can't tell anyone else.\n\nWhen I talk with my SO and he asks me where I am/what I'm doing, I am completely honest with him, so often it happens that I tell him I'm hanging out with J. My SO often (playfully) mentions that we shouldn't hang out so much, because I'm a girl, and J is a guy, and he thinks that J likes me. I have said in the past that I'm not J's type, that J already has someone else who he's interested in, etc., and because my SO is a good sport and he trusts me, he has usually accepted it.\n\nHowever, recently it has become a bit of a sticking point. If I say I'm hanging out with J, he says, \"Again??\", and ask me why I spend so much time with him. Though I have tried to placate him, I understand fully where he is coming from (I would also be annoyed if he spent a lot of alone time with a female friend) and I don't know how to make this situation go away without outright telling him \"J is gay, can we forget about this problem and move on?\"\n\nHowever, I promised J that I wouldn't tell anyone about his orientation. He and my SO have met in the past, and he also hooked up with my SO's best friend and specifically told me not to tell ANYONE. So it's a little complicated.\n\nSo I guess my question is, which is more important? Trust within my relationship, or trust within my friendship?\nTL;DR:"}

I ask who he is and I find out that I know him, even though not well. We chat about the ceremony and I give myself a mental high five for having been a slighlty better person.\n\nFast forward to 3 weeks later: I'm in my hometown hangin out with friends: I mention to them that I learned that XX (the guy) was gettin married, and they told me: \"OMG, haven't you heard? The marriage is canceled because he ran away!\". Well.. shit happens, I guess.\n\nThe next day I met again the girl at the gym, and I have this brilliant conversation start:\n\n\" So.. I heard your friend's marriage didn't go that good, uh?\"\n\nShe looks at me horrified and says:\n\n\"What friend are you talking about?!?! It was my sister!!!\"\n\nI'll never ever say anything again. To anyone.\nTL;DR:"}

I met my boyfriend (Jack) when we were living at school together. He was a business major and I am pre-med. We go to school in California not too far from where I grew up and where my entire family lives. Jack on the other hand lives across the country and has no family in the area. \n\nWe've been dating for about two years. When we first met things were great! But I just don't feel the way I used to about our relationship. I hated going two days without seeing him, now it will be two weeks and I don't even miss him. We used to text 24/7, but now it feels like such a chore to text him because I really don't have anything to talk about. When he asks why I'm being distant I blame it on being super busy applying for med school. \n\nThe reason I feel like we can't break up is because I am all he has here. He decided to stay in California for graduate school and I am 99% sure the only reason he did that is because of me. I know he doesn't like living here because he complains about it a lot and says how he can't wait till he can move back home (still a few years till he finishes his program though). The problem is he wants me to go with him. I could NEVER live on the east coast; my entire family is here in California. I have no intention on leaving them and moving across the country with him, but I also know there is no way he would ever permanently move here. \n\nWe broke up once before for a month but ended up getting back together. I am starting to think now that the only reason I got back with him is because I missed the idea of being with someone, not necessarily missed being with him. \n\nHelp reddit I feel stuck. I don't know how to break up with him. He really doesn't have anyone else here. He has some \"friends\" from school but no one that he really hangs out with, all of his good friends live back home which is another reason he wants to move back there.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm perfectly capable of a proper mourning and moving on process.  And I'm not mournful, sad or even heartbroken, I'm over all that, it's been well over a year since we were romantic and I haven't even talked to her in several months.\n\nOnly problem is this weird feeling I have for her.  I've never really believed in soul mates but I just have this feeling like she is the one.  I haven't been pining away either.  I've stayed very active and put a great deal of energy into my work.  I've been out with other women and met some really great people, but I always have this feeling for her pulling me in like a siren's song.  \n\n Most nights I wake up in the middle of the night thinking of her. I don't remember my dreams but I can only assume she's in them since she's on my mind as I come to.  And nothing in particular about her either just the general thought of her and that feel.\n\nWith my current work situation, I have an opportunity to move to be in the same city as her. It wouldn't be a much of a hassle to move and my expenses would be the same, but I don't have much of a reason to move other than for her and the weather being nicer there.\nTL;DR:"}

Advice?\nPOST: We're both in our twenties, and have been best friends for as long as I can remember. I've always had really strong feelings for him but never thought he felt the same for me. When we finally got together it was great, and I was so happy that things had finally gone where I wanted them to. We love each other, and know that we're each others' soul mates, but because we live together we argue a lot about minor little things and get so pissed off sat each other for it. Recently, I've been feeling like he's lying to me about where he's been and who he's with and I feel like we're still just best friends that kiss (at home; never in public). I guess I feel like the relationship isn't real, and that he's just stringing me along only to leave me and utterly break my heart in a year or two. The feeling that the relationship isn't real, or is only partly there is killing me and I don't know what to do or say to make it better. Every time I do say something, it just gets turned around and shoved back in my face. I'm tired of it, but oddly enough, I don't want the relationship to end. I guess I feel like he's not giving me and this relationship a chance. I should also add that I'm extremely insecure about myself, and have only been in one other serious relationship like this which ended by me being cheated on. Am I just paranoid about being cheated on again? Everyone who knows how the relationship is going says I deserve better, that he's acting really immature. If we were to break up, I feel like I would have wasted the last 5 years of my life trying to get to this relationship only to throw it away after a month.\nTL;DR:"}

He's a wonderful guy, and has never been anything but trustworthy, kind, etc. Naturally, he has a lot of friends, both male and female. I've met a good amount of them and we all get along just fine. He does, however, have one female friend that really bugs me.\n\nAlong with his roommate, she's one of the only people he knows around his university. She's a nice girl, yeah, but the fact that she incessantly comments on all of his Facebook posts (except ones involving me), takes dozens of photos when they're together, and messages him on ever medium possible really grates on my nerves. They hang out together at his house to watch tv shows, along with my boyfriend's roommate and his girlfriend. This whole \"double date\" setup, put simply, kind of pisses me off.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that he posted a picture of his new room on Facebook, and she commented something that implies, yeah, she's been in his bedroom.\n\nI've said flat-out that I don't like her, but I know that I have no right to tell my boyfriend to not be friends with someone just because they have an extremely obvious crush on him. I sort of subtly bring up how uncomfortable I am with her, but every time I do my boyfriend seems to think that my being jealous is cute.\n\nI don't want to be one of those horror story obsessive girlfriends.

We were friends for about 6 months before we got together. In the last semester (we are in college together) we transitioned from friends with benefits to exclusive and more serious. Neither of us need the BF/GF label but in almost every aspect we are dating. We did just recently have a talk where we agreed that we would both like to continue to be together in the new semester.

She is fairly anti-romantic stuff and its really tough for her to commit. She is the type of girl to laugh at rom-coms instead of day-dreaming about them. Its a minor miracle I am where I am with her and it took her a long time until she felt comfortable with the idea of us going on dates. I don't want to make her uncomfortable or think that I'm pushing for further commitment, I just want to show the girl I'm with that I care for her.

I've tried being more helpful around the house so she doesn't have busywork distracting her. I've tried more foreplay (she gets bored and asks me to just do it and get it over with. Ouch.) I've even offered to let her mess around with other guys if that would stimulate her sex drive (getting desperate). She is on birth control - loestrin 24 I believe, but she was off it for a month and that didn't improve her sex drive at all. \n\nNothing has worked and her complete lack of a sex drive has frustrated me beyond belief.

Its been getting worse and worse recently and it generally revolves around social interactions etc. For example I'm going to a new sixth form and on the induction day I tried making a joke in class (it was pretty much a dad joke, the teacher said \"say anything and you'll get it right\" I then stupidly said \"anything\"). Not many heard but I know one guy looked back at me and now i've spent the last 3 weeks of my summer constantly worried that everyone at the new school will think im a loser etc.\n\nThis has all stemmed from being a late bloomer which really knocked my confidence so Im usually very quiet in classes because im extremely self-concious leading to my popularity to plummet in the past few years. So i tried to seem more confident at new school and have just embarrassed myself for when we go back ...\n\nAnyway HELP ME get out of this mindset.

I underwent reconstructive surgery on my ear as a kid. It didn't go well and now what I have is arguably just as deformed before. You'd think it'd be the first thing people notice about me but thanks to the beauty of long hair it's something I'm able to hide most of the time.\n\nI wish it were that simple to bring up and say to my new SO but I just can't get it out. It wouldn't be the first time I've talked about this to a guy but I've come to realize this will be the first time I bring it up when I truly care about what he'll think of me and his reaction, both immediate and long term. I really like this guy.\n\nThis is one of the most personal things about me - the hardest topic for me to talk about face to face. It's not the barebone facts of the matter...it's really not that huge of a deal when you strip away all the baggage I feel is attached to it. What makes it tough for me is all the bullying I went through as a kid and teen because of it and the impact I allowed it to have on my self-worth and quality of life (quit all sports around age 12, will never tie my hair up in public because of the staring).\nTL;DR:"}

Even some times when we are together or intament it briefly hits me, I am not special she has had this before I'm just the next / last in a line. I also know a few of her ex-partners and have a very vivid and sometimes uncontrolled imagination, this also is not fun a contribution to the issues.\n  \nThis feeling really hurts allot, and I'm worried our relationship cannot survive my insecurity's with such a distance between us.

I trust him completely and he's never given me any reason not to. As far as I know, he trusts me just the same. I've never felt that he didn't. Our relationship is going great, and it's one I really want to keep. I don't have many insecurities, nor have I ever snooped on him, or tried to dig for any information including anything he does on the computer or in any of his personal stuff in our home and have never looked through his phone, etc. I've even gotten on his computer to check my email once to find his logged in, and I logged out immediately. Basically, I have no interest in what he's doing in any of these ways because I trust him. \n\nSo...with that said, almost every time he's on the computer and he hears me coming into the room I hear him start clicking closed the tabs (i assume) on his internet. When I get down the hall and into the room he's usually already turned away from the computer looking at me, with nothing on the screen. Either that or I catch him doing his process - right clicking on the recycle bin and running a \"cleaner\" to clean his computer. Then just looks at me like nothing just happened. There are variations to how this goes, but that is basically it. And it happens almost daily.  \n\nIn the moment, I've never mentioned it. I just go on like nothing happens. Mostly because I didn't think much of it at first. But after patterns of this happening. I found it odd. So I have mentioned it a couple of times in passing, saying that I find the behavior odd. He laughs it off and says he's used to doing it at work when someone walks up. I have seen a very slight change in his behavior since I casually mentioned it, but pretty much the same thing is happening. \n\nMy question is: is this suspicious behavior to others? Or is it probably nothing (as I'm hoping) since he's a great guy who's never broken my trust? \n\nThoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

But I just can't seem to like the guys who show interest in me. Not romantically anyway, which is a major bummer, because the things I want the most from a partner are to be able to trust them, find a safe space and be happy with them, and let them care for me. Contrary to my wants, I seem to be attracted to the ones who can't or won't be with me for some reason or another.\n\nThis unavailability feature has been a common theme in all my relationships so far, even before the recovery, serious and flings. And it has always been easier to fall for the 'bad' guy, to give rather than take, which inevitably has ended badly.\n\nI'd like to change all that, and be with someone who genuinely wants to be with me.

I've dated my girlfriend since I was a sophomore in high-school, great relationship until the end of my freshman year of college. This was our first real break-up, she left me because she liked someone else, and she wasn't immediately honest about it. I was a mess for 3 weeks until she came back to me. \n\nThings changed a little when we were both in college, we're not really the party type so we both grew up a little. We had our problems every now and then, every couple does, but for the most part we were really happy. Things got routine and she never liked that, but a lot of times we didn't have many chances to do sporadic activities.\n\nWe stopped having sex as much, all because of her, which bothered me but I endured. She has told me that her sex drive just isn't what it used to be and she doesn't know why, but we still had sex once or twice a week. On good weeks, every day. Those weeks were awesome, for both of us.\n\nNow to the problem, she has told me that she feels caged about our relationship and that she feels like she is missing apart of life by us having been together for so long. I asked her what she wanted to experience and why it's something we can't experience together, but she doesn't give me a specific answer. I'm now 22 and she is 21. I'm majoring in MIS and she is nursing.\n\nI love her, and would really rather not lose her. Anyone have any advice?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [22/M] Struggling to talk to my girlfriend [21/F] about my worsening body image and newfound insecurities\nPOST: Hey all,\n\nMy SO and I have been dating for a year and a half now. We're both seniors in college, and with med school applications on my plate, I recently decided to give up my 3-year spot on the rowing team.\n\nAlthough my girlfriend has never been an ardent sports fan, I know that she was always very proud of/attracted to the fact that I was a varsity athlete. I also know that she appreciated my body a lot while I was on the team, and that she has been dissatisfied before by her \"less fit\" ex-boyfriends.\n\nHowever, between my busy semester and my secession from the team, I'm rapidly heading the same way. I'm still in fairly good shape, but I'm clearly not the athlete that I was 6 months ago, and it's been eating at me. I can see the difference in the mirror, and I've lost a lot of confidence in myself. When I ask my girlfriend about it, she says that \"she hasn't noticed a change\", but I know that can't be true.\n\nThe \"problem\" is that she's an extremely kind, loving, and supportive girlfriend. And while I love and appreciate her so much for those traits, I'm afraid that they're getting in the way of an honest and necessary conversation.\n\nThe first time I brought this up, she reassured me and brushed it off very casually, so I just let it go. However, when I tried to bring it up again with a more serious tone, she got very uncomfortable and continued to insist half-heartedly that she \"couldn't tell the difference\". It was pretty awkward for both of us, so I let it slide again, but now I don't know what to do. I really just want to have an open, candid conversation with her, but I don't know how to put her at ease. This is the first time that I've felt unable to communicate with her about something and I'm at a loss. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/college\nTITLE: Budgeting Tips?\nPOST: Hey /r/college , as a sophomore in high school currently worrying about the costs of college and pondering what exactly I should put aside for living expenses etc, I'm wondering what resources would be helpful to begin budgeting now in order to put plenty of money aside for college. As I've recently gotten myself a job, I plan to use this money as wisely as I can to prepare for my future.\n\nIf it helps, I'm fairly academically qualified so I plan on going to a higher-end four-year university or state school (considering California school system, out of state, and similarly ranked schools) and living in the dorms. I shouldn't need much transportation, and the explicit costs of attending college itself should be/will be dealt with.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Best Prepaid cards out there? Need to help a family member.\nPOST: Hopefully this is a good place to ask. It is the first that came to mind, and I think it fits. Apologies if it's not the right place. I'd appreciate a point in the right direction if it is not.\n\nAnyway, I am looking for recommendations on prepaid debit cards that I can reload remotely. Ideally I'm looking for one with low fees that I can load online from either paypal or my bank account, that either cannot be used at an ATM or has a high enough ATM fee to make it cost prohibitive. \n\nI know the last part sounds a little odd, but here is the situation. My sister lives a few states away, and has been having a really rough time of the last few years. To put it lightly and most succinctly, she makes poor life decisions, especially when it comes to the people she brings into her life. She's ended up in trouble a few times recently, and the pictures I've seen of her... She looks strung out. I had been wiring her a little money here and there when she was desperate, but I'm pretty far in debt myself, and the thought she's taking advantage of me to further harm herself is both infuriating and heartbreaking.\n\nSo, while I know where there is a will, there is a way, and if she wants to use what I give her for barter or cash to do what she will with it, I would like to at least put a stumbling block in the middle to make that more difficult, but still make sure she gets food and whatnot. \n\nShe's in a spot now, where she's removing herself from those influences, and there is a chance to help her get out of that situation and get better. I don't want to see it pass, so I want to help her. But I don't want to enable either. It's a rough spot to be.\n\nSorry for the ramble, I'm just sort of at my wits' end with this.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [29/m] looking for advice on whether or not she [26/f] is interested.\nPOST: So I went to the pharmacy today to get a flu shot and the pharmacist that administered it ended up being a friend of a friend. I've never really hung out with this girl but the mutual connection is a very close friend of both of ours so there really wasn't any awkwardness.  She asked me questions like where I live and she told me a few things about herself but--and here's where my confusion/uncertainty lies--a major focus of the conversation was my job. I work for a company that also does work in pharmaceuticals. She expressed interest in getting out of where she currently works and getting into a company like mine. I told her that I'm sure that I could help her out or at least ask around for opportunities and then we got back to some small talk. She then offered her number to me but I (regretfully) never offered mine or said 'we should hang out sometime'. \n\nSo basically I'm unsure about whether or not this girl would be open to me getting in touch for reasons (like hanging out/getting drinks and whatnot) or if she just wants me to treat it as a business relationship. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by taking my roommate to work\nPOST: I was woken up this morning by my roommate asking me to take her to work because the other car in the house wasn't working. I said sure and to wake me up when she needed to go. \n\nKeep in mind my girlfriend was in my bed sleeping next to me and she was to come with us.\n\nI had just bought my car on Thursday and I haven't transferred the title (don't have it yet), got new plates, and I don't have insurance. There were all kinds of wrong with me driving my car today. But I did it anyways because fuck what could possibly happen?\n\nWell as I'm backing out of the parking lot I immediately slam into a parked car. I panicked and drove off leaving the scene of the accident. My girlfriend is in the passenger seat just staring at me in shock as I'm driving off and my other roommate pipes up from the back seat saying \"dude did you just hit that car?\" They were all freaking out.\n\nI get called by my roommate 20 minutes later saying \"dude you just hit a car at my work they are talking about calling the cops you need to come back.\" I was feeling pretty fucking guilty anyways and was going to return so I hopped in my car and drove right back.\n\nThey didn't know who owned the car. The person who owned the car worked there but hadn't been there in days. There was a sign on the dashboard that said \"sorry, ran out of gas.\" That was probably the best thing I heard all morning. So all I really had to do was leave my information with the security guard. If the owner of the car had been there it would've been a completely different story.\n\nWhenever that person does return to get their car they will realize what happened and I will get that dreaded phone call. The only damage on that car is a few scratches on their front bumper but damn. I personally will, if reported, will lose my license for at least 30 days for driving without insurance and get a reckless operation charge. It looks like I should be cleared for the hit and run.\nTL;DR:"}

So thank you.\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of way, let's get to the issue. \n\nSo my S.O. and I have been dating for about 2 years and things are going wonderfully. We are talking about proposals, our sex life, our jobs, chores, bills etc. It is a very open relationship.\n\n I have always been more physically fit and slimmer than her and that has led to small tiffs that usually end with me convincing her that I find her attractive no matter what. She is by no means large, but she has some curvy hips and upper thighs which I find very attractive. However since we've started our new jobs as teachers we've been getting pretty lazy in the evenings and weekends. We spend most of our time recuperating from having our energy sucked from our souls by small children all day. She's been putting on weight to other areas of her body and I can tell it's bothering her quite a bit. She says she wants to start shedding the extra \"pudge\"  by running and exercising a bit. I don't know how to support her with that exactly, other than starting to exercise myself and by leading by example. \n\nI agree that if she wants to start shedding those extra pounds she should! However I am also no fool as to the fact that weight is a very sensitive subject with certain women. (My S.O. also has a history with being bullied throughout her childhood) I want to be as supportive and sensitive as I can be while still encouraging her to drop those extra pounds and get back to that bodacious body because I know that that's what both of us really want.\nTL;DR:"}

Since they've broken up she and I have become better friends.\n\nWe're both mid twenties but we live in different cities. We've connected very well, so I've thought, on an emotional level.

So I tell her whatever and we go about our day.  \n\nLater on,  I was alone and I felt the intense need to get a booger that was driving me crazy.  I figured I'm alone and there won't be anyone to judge so I'll take care of it. \n\nI start getting after the nuisance and successfully extract it but in the process I scrape the inside of my nose.  It didn't hurt too bad so I assumed nothing would come of it.  I assumed wrong.  \n\nWithin seconds I felt a warm wet feeling going from my nose and then DRIPPING off of my lip.  I put my hand to it and then immediately pulled it back whenever I touched the wetness to see that apparently my nose was bleeding profusely. It took hours of holding my head back and a lot if Kleenex to make my nose stop bleeding. And I ruined a nice shirt while trying to stop it.\nTL;DR:"}

At first I was like \"sure, I guess so\" but then thought about it for a while and am not sure if this is okay with me. I don't want to forbid him from going to his friend's birthday, but I really don't feel like I matter in this sense, like he doesn't really care to spend this time with me. Maybe I'm just being over-sensitive, I don't know...\n\nI suppose I should mention also that someone is going to be there, this girl L who has gotten in between us quite a few times and has basically been toxic to our relationship. After a year of me being upset of her antics and constantly explaining/re-explaining to E about how upset she makes me and how uncomfortable I feel that she is going to be around him.

We have three cats in total, 2 spayed females and the male.  One female and the male fight often and don't get along generally but it's not always that way.  The female marks as well and outright just empties her bladder whenever she sees fit.  She rarely uses the litter box at all.  The male will use the litter and we've noticed that most of his peeing behaviour is marking.\nThis has been going on for some time now and we are faced with some home renovations for flooring that we are postponing because of the destruction caused by the marking and spraying.  \nHere are some of the things that we have tried over the years, yes... years.  \nPheremone spray, and collars.  Enzyme cleaners, bleach,  peppermint oil soap, white vinegar and steam cleaners.  Different brands and types of litters.  \nWe have 4 litter boxes as we've heard that we should have one extra than the amount of cats that we have.  We've even tried some sort of spray on the cats fur that was supposed to make them smell similar.\nWe love these cats dearly, all three were personally rescued by our family. But now we have reached our limit and are faced with trying to find a home for the male or having him put down.  We are targeting the male because when we had a friend house him for 2 weeks, the female stopped completely and was back to using the litter.  Albeit this was a couple of years ago now.\n\nI should also note that the two problem cats were fine for the longest time and lived in harmony until the male got sick and had crystals in his urine.  The treatment for that seemed to trigger the marking and spraying behaviour.\n\nWe are still willing to try something different and are open to advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I met him through a friend \u2013 we went out, got drunk, had sex. It would seem very straightforward. I treated it as a one-night-stand, asked him to leave not long afterwards. Then he wrote to me and asked me out. We met up, had a wonderful time \u2013 I started to like him.\n\nThe evening after the date, he wrote to me \u2013 explained that he's planning to move away in half a year, doesn't want to hurt himself or me, offered to be friends. I would think it's the usual \"let's just be friends\" excuse, but everyone who knows him is saying he's just trying to be responsible. In addition, he genuinely seems interested in keeping in touch.\n\nI don't know what to think. I developed a pretty big crush; we're still in constant communication; he occasionally implies \"whatever happens, happens\" \u2013 what should I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/cats\nTITLE: Cat has made it a routine to go potty whenever I get settled down on my laptop?\nPOST: So basically I'll put it like this:\n\nI have a cat, four year old Ragdoll breed girl. She's a healthy and happy kitty. I like to game and where I sit when I game is at a table in the basement, and her litter box is about 5 metres behind me. Now you might ask, doesn't it get stinky sitting so close to it? Well, not really, because I clean it every day. The thing is that whenever I come downstairs to game on my laptop or just do stuff on my laptop in general she ALWAYS goes to the litter box. It may seem like I'm over dramatizing but I literally mean always. As a result I after getting settled into whatever I'm doing I have to get up again and go scoop up the stuff or else everything starts to smell as one would expect.\n\nJust as I finish typing this, she came downstairs, threw up a hairball (nice bonus today) and then went and did her business in the litter box.\n\nIs this normal? Should I not get irritated by this? It's just an annoyance that it happens almost every single day that I'm downstairs.\nTL;DR:"}

What do I do?\nPOST: I've worked in our family business for almost 4 years now. When I started, my grandmother was on medical leave and I was working for my Aunt.  2.5 years ago, my Aunt left for another job and my grandmother returned part-time and is training her replacement, who will take over in 1 year.\n\nI am in university, and this job is a great fit for me.  I love the work itself (childcare), the hours are flexible, and the pay is decent.  I don't think I could find anything similar with the same pay.  Being the boss's granddaughter does have it's perks.\n\nHOWEVER, in the last 3 months or so, my grandmother has become nearly impossible to work for.  I know a lot of the staff have had issues with her in the past, but it has never affected me until now.  The biggest issue I have is that she treats me like I am incompetent 90% of the time.  Nothing I do is right, and she is very rude in the way she communicates this to me.  I know I am good at my job, but I think it's a control issue for her more than anything.  I've tried bringing this up with her, but she gets very defensive and it makes the next few weeks even worse.\n\nAnyway, if this happened in any other job, I would leave in a heartbeat.  But, I know that if I left she would start working 60 hour weeks and make herself sick again.  The only reason she doesn't work those long hours is because I am at work when she isn't.  She doesn't trust any of the other staff enough to leave them in charge.\n\nSo, I don't want this job to ruin my relationship with my grandmother, but I don't feel like I am in a position where I can leave.  What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

He is 23 and I am 19 (f). We have been friends for 4 years now, but we have been really best friends for about the last 2 years. \n\nAbout a year ago he started liking me, and I didn't feel the same. I was in a relationship at the time, and just had no interest in him. He tried to stop liking me after everyone told him it was a bad idea, and we went on. It came back up during this past winter break, but I tried to ignore and avoid all situations. And here we are again, where we recently took a road trip together to visit some friends and spent more time consecutively than we ever have. It was a good week until almost the end where he flipped out, basically saying that I didn't find him good  enough to date, and he doesn't understand why we don't. (he was really intoxicated when he said all of this) We have had several long discussions since the trip about 2 weeks ago, and here is where we are. \n\nHe likes me, and I am honestly interested in him...we spend a lot of time together and we are two peas in a pod and I KNOW he'd make a good boyfriend...but I can't imagine being sexual with him.

I play on a local sports team and he is a referee for that team-which is something he did for us to be able to spend more time together.\n\nSeveral days ago, I noticed he was actively messaging on Facebook on his phone, and so being the naturally nosey person that I am, I asked him who it was. He said it was the coach of my sports team, who is also a female. I asked if they were talking about the upcoming game and he said yes, but as he scrolled up there were pages and pages of text. I asked him if I could read their conversation, and he said yes but was really hesitant to give me the phone. Long story short...they talk about a lot more than the game/sport. They talk about their personal lives, and say flirty things with each other, and there are even a ton of \"smiling\" and \"winking\" emoticons to top it off. At one point, he even tells her how much I look up to her, and that I need extra encouragement because it's my first game with the new team (I recently moved to another city to be with him), and that the extra encouragement will make me feel better because I'm so nervous. I recognize that he probably did this with good intentions in order to help, but I feel like he made me look weak. In a way, I feel like he humiliated me in front of her on purpose after seeing what else they had been saying to each other. Like I needed to be coddled by her because I'm a nervous little tit, apparently. \n\nAnyway, I am mad/upset about it. I feel like he has driven a wedge in between me and the thing I love most (the sport), and has made it weird for me to even go to practice because now I feel there is some sort of weird tension between the two of them. Maybe I am overreacting, but I still don't feel good about what went on. I feel like I can't share anything personal with him now because he will run and go tell her all about it.\nTL;DR:"}

Just a wonderful guy overall and my kids love him. We have realized we don't have much in common and agree we are probably not right for each other. But we are happy with our living situation and want to stay friends and roommates. When we start dating other people, we discussed revisiting the living situation and figuring out a transition plan out since the kids are involved and attached to him.\n\nAnyway, there are numerous positive reasons for staying in the same living space for both of us. \n\n1) He has cheaper rent and I have someone who is contributing that I trust\n2) We know we make really good roommates/friends\n3) The kids really love him and would be heartbroken if he just disappeared\n\nWe also feel that if we are friends we may find common ground over the years and potentially date again.\n\nBut, I told my sister about it and she is freaking out and saying I am abusing and manipulating him because he loves me. I explained he's an adult and also wants to do this! She said it's completely dysfunctional. Just an overall horrible conversation. So reddit, what do you say? Can this work?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: rubbernecking driver yelled at me while i was on the scene of my first car accident. has anyone every experienced similar?\nPOST: Hey Reddit:\n\nYesterday afternoon, while driving back to my apartment from my parent's house (about a 3.5 hour drive), I was involved in an accident. There was heavy stop-and-go-traffic, and traffic was accelerating. We were probably going 25-30 mph in a 65 mph zone when four or five cars in front of my braked very suddenly for no apparent reason. I tried to stop and pull to the side but was unsuccessful, and I hit the car in front of me.\n\nMy car (96 corolla) was pretty messed up, front hood all bent, bumper fucked, pretty much totaled, since the car isn't worth much. The car that I hit, a late model jeep, just had some scratches on the bumper and a broken license plate holder, since I mostly hit the spare tire on the back of the car (since the jeep was set much higher than my corolla). The other driver and I were both wearing our seat belts, and though shaken up, we were both uninjured.\n\nWhile we were sitting on the shoulder with the state police officer running our information, traffic, naturally slowed around us. One asshole felt the need to slow down, roll down his window and yell \"learn to drive, asshole\" at me (the other driver was sitting in her car, so it had to be directed at me).\n\nI was shocked by the abuse, since I was literally sitting on the railing on the shoulder in shock, crying and shaking (my first car accident in 8 years of driving, 24 yo female). Also, it's not as if my accident caused the traffic; it was really heavy before this even happened, which is what caused me to hit the other car.\n\nSo my question is this: does any one else have a similar story? If so, what did you do/how did you react? I feel like shit about the whole situation, so it would really help me out if someone has been through something similar.\nTL;DR:"}

She's really never been good with other dogs, but always affectionate and kind with people.\n\nBefore I moved out of the house about 3 years ago, we started noticing behaviour that was out of character for her... she'd just \"snap\" and growl at us, then go back to normal as if nothing had happened.  Since I've left home, she's been attacking my mom and dad more and more frequently.  It's gotten to the point where she needs to be crated whenever anybody comes over, because she'll just lunge at them whether she knows them or not.  She has broken skin on numerous occasions.\n\nOver the past year,  my parents have taken her to two separate vets to get her checked out for anything unusual.  They also hired a dog whisperer to work with her. Neither were successful in diagnosing/improving her behavior.\n\nToday, my mom spoke with the breeder, and she told her that our dog is not behaving normally at all and attributes it to some form of mental illness/disease.  She believes our dog could have suffered a stroke and may have been experiencing a series of small strokes over the years.  She told my mom that our dog must be put down, for both her and our sake.\n\nIt's been a very difficult pill for me to swallow and I feel as though there must be an avenue we haven't exhausted yet. \n\nHas anyone been in this situation before?  Is euthanasia really the answer? Please help, I love her dearly and can't bear the thought of an empty house without her.\nTL;DR:"}

I used to be \"seeing\" her best friend a while ago, and she has told me on several occasions that she gets jealous when I talk to her and any other girl for that matter. I've managed to built up our relationship strongly, so that she still feels like she is chasing me blah blah but she has doubts sometimes if she wants to get serious, since she has been hurt badly before.\n\nAnyway, I usually leave the texting up to her and she openly complains and winds me up when I dont text her, saying she makes all the effort on the texting front.

She was working midweek a lot more than usual and the text conversation was broken up a lot and subsequently it was quite poor. I found the conversation never properly got going like usual, and it was just smalltalk for a week. On friday at a party, she didn't want to go some place private as usual, but she still kinda made small talk with me.\n\nI started to panic, thinking \"oh shit, what if she's getting bored of me?\". So I asked her later by text, and she said not to worry, that she just didn't feel like talking. However, she said goodnight which is unusual as, as I said, we usually fall asleep and continue the next day. \n\nSo as anticipated, no reply in the morning. I waited until monday, and I text her first. She replied all day and we made jokes a little, but again she said goodnight at the end of the day.

I was a bit worried because there were times when I acted like a dick and she stayed nice. I told her to stand up for herself if I was being a jerk.\n\nWe got married after 1.5 years together. It was a pretty terrible year. I became depressed and no doubt took that out on her sometimes. She started fighting back, calling me out on my behavior. I want to say that 80% of the time, she started fights. They were usually about me doing something she didn't like. This arguing got so bad that I started to consider divorce, blaming mostly myself. I wanted her to be happy, and I wasn't making her happy.\n\nTwo months ago she started going to therapy and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist got her started on some kind of anti-depressant/anti-anxiety med which she takes every day. I don't know if it's a coincidence, but right around that time my wife did a complete 180. \n\nShe is basically like when we were going out: affectionate, often laughing, nurturing, a bit submissive. \n\nBefore, she'd get upset if I made a joke that she found deragatory or mean-spirited, now she laughs. Before, she'd get upset if I criticized a dinner she made, now she takes note of it and changes how she cooks. Before, she would watch and listen to whatever she wanted, now she doesn't if she knows I hate it.\n\nIm a bit worried about her. I want her to be happy. She seems really happy lately, and we've been having fun like old times again. I just worry that she's surpressing herself. And I think it's kind of creepy that meds can do this to someone.

We are very happy and in love. My younger cousin is my favorite out of 8 female cousins. She is beautiful, smart, open-minded and nice. Her mother died when she was still a kid, so for years now she has come to me for advice (especially sexual and womanly advice). She bonded with my boyfriend instantly since the day they met and obviously enjoy seeing each other. We don't see her often though. However, I feel that she has a crush on him that is getting stronger, and this is a bit worrisome and why I come for advice...\n\nFor instance, I have notice her getting increasingly more \"touchy\" with him. She will hold his arm and give him little massages on his back or shoulders. When we eat together I see her making an effort to sit next to him or as close as  possible. I told her in confidence how my boyfriend loves to talk about sex and she has started to talk about vaginas and penises more often than seems necessary. She laughs at all his jokes and even in big groups is always focused on him. I know these examples might seem insignificant, but the way she looks at him and interacts with him makes me wary. My boyfriend obviously likes the attention, and I assume he sees it as nothing to worry about.\n\nI guess my concern is that I'm at the limit of what I find comfortable, but if her physical contact escalates I will find myself in an unfortunate situation that I won't know how to handle. Advice please?\n\nI would also love examples of what other people find acceptable and not acceptable. I don't want to feel jealousy when I shouldn't, especially from a cousin that I love, so examples might be helpful. Thnaks!!!\nTL;DR:"}

I am afraid I am going to look like a complete fraud. I cannot hide my wife and child from them either. I'm so embarrassed of lies I told and I wish I could go back and start honestly again. There is the additional issue of some of my conduct while my wife was away. It was less than becoming and I am afraid some of it will make me look lecherous to my friends, many of whom are very moral people.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: My (27/m) boyfriend won't listen to me (22/f) anymore.\nPOST: Let me start off by saying that I am almost 8 months pregnant. Please be gentle. I'm in a fragile state. When my boyfriend and I first met we partied a lot. He still hadn't grown up yet. We had only been together 3 months before we found out I was pregnant. At first things were a little rocky. He would still go out all the time and I would get pissed. Since then things have slowed down a lot. He hardly goes out anymore and when he does he doesn't drink very much. I'm very proud of him for that. Lately though he's been going out more and more. He's very lazy when it comes to things he doesn't want to do. Who isn't? It's to the point now that I feel like I have to drag him to do anything at all. He watches movies and plays on his phone all day and I can't seem to get his attention. A task that should take 5 minutes takes him and hour to do. Important things aren't getting done. Like getting his fingerprints and drug test done for his new job. We need to go on a road trip to go get all of the things for the baby. We had a plan for a week and a half to leave yesterday and that didn't happen because he kept lazing around. Lately he's been going out a lot more. He's been out every night since Halloween. He doesn't come home drunk he's just been out. I don't know if he's just nervous about the baby coming or what, but it's really ticking me off. He knows that. I'm frantic trying to nest and he's being more lazy than I've ever seen him be. I don't know how to get his attention. I can't give him an ultimatum. I don't have one to give besides me leaving, but that's not what's best right now. We're both going through a hard time. I don't know how to talk to him. When I try to just talk he listens, but it isn't very effective. When I blow up and get mad he just gets mad and doesn't listen at all. This is really the only big thing in our relationship so far that has been troubling us besides him partying at the beginning.\nTL;DR:"}

First time here but I really need someone to talk to.\n\nSo in short here's the plot :\n\nMy GF of 3 years (we are are both 20 yo) left last night (gmt+1) for a 4 days citytrip in Bratislava with 3 female friends. They are staying in a youth hostel and sleep in a mixed room (i.e. with potentially 16 other boys/girls). I texted her this morning to see if everything was alright and she said that yes, the city was fine and that she just had taken a nap. She also said french boys were sleeping next to them and that it was a bit awkward. I just texted her (it's 11:50 pm here and there), asking many questions and she simply replied \"We've met a group of french and belgian boys and were are leaving to have a drink with them, it's cool! How are you?\". Needless to say I didn't react well. However I didn't tell her, I don't want to ruin her trip. \n\nA little background info : it's the fourth time she goes on a trip with her female friends, everytime there's a lot of partying and they always end up meeting foreing boys (Never encoutered any girls, I must have bad luck). The very first time she left we had a bad time because I found hidden pictures of her on somebody's laps and very close dancing (and worse) in her computer ! She has always been a little naive (if not stupid), she thought boys in night clubs only wanted to dance and pay her drinks to be friends. I've told her numerous times but she's always being hit on every night out..\n\nDo you think I'm being jealous? Should I tell her how I feel? What should I do?\n\nThanks !\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for 13 months and I'm starting to have doubts about the relationship. He wants to move away for work and is searching for jobs in other states but as of right now doesn't know if he's ready to have me to go with him. So he wants to try a long distance relationship until he's settled and can bring me to wherever he is. Or until he's decided that I'm worthy?? Not sure.. \n\nWe don't live together because he's not ready. It bothers me but I can't push him. We both love each other and spend all our free time together. However, I'm starting to doubt the potential of this relationship because I feel he's either afraid to commit, or doesn't think I'm the right one for him. And with an impending LDR over my head (with no real direction for us), I don't know if we should keep dating. I really don't want to lose him though.\n\nI think a LDR is a bad idea, especially without a real plan to be together. And I think we want the relationship to progress at two different paces. Me faster and him slower. I want to discuss this with him but I don't know how to approach the situation. I want him to know how I feel and discuss it logically without breaking up upon first mention of doubt. \n\nOh, and there is no saying when he'll leave. He hasn't found a job yet. Could be in two months or it could be in two years. I hate to walk away from someone wonderful over such uncertainty. \n\nAny advice? Thoughts? Do I need to be more patient or does he need to decide what he wants from me? I don't want to screw this up.\nTL;DR:"}

I thought what the heck since I'm single... \n\nThe visit was fine and I really enjoyed his presence! It just sucked that we couldn't really go out a lot due to the location being very business-y and small-- Hell, even his colleague saw him and I at the movies one night. Really affectionate and sweet IRL. May I also add that he was extremely busy with meetings and didn't come back to the hotel room until 9pm.\n\nAfter my visit, it seemed like he wasn't so interested in me... Prior to meeting, he used to spam \"I love you\" to me and such, but now.. Not so much. I'm not sure if I'm being too clingy, but I like reassurance since I have shit confidence. I asked him if he was still interested in me and wanted to date, and I also expressed that he seemed much more interested before we met. He got annoyed and his answer was: \"The difference between you and me is that I don't have to show it 24/7.. No one else is getting more attention than you in my life currently. I speak to you more than I do to my colleagues or my flatmate. Maybe I should do a pie chart of my day so you'd see the time i dedicate to you\"\n\nI've been on Skype for like 2 hours before with no \"Hi\" from him. Most cases, I initiate the convo...

Now I'm lucky enough that I haven't been cheated on (that I know of) but there's always been a guy that pops up in my current girlfriend's life who then proceed to talk to them all the time, until I get broken up with. Usually they use the phrase \"I want to try something new,\" or \"I want to be single for a while.\" Inevitably, however, they always end up with that guy.  \n\nSo I'm insecure a lot.  And in a probably not all that ironic twist of fate I became that guy. I started talking to my girlfriend, who was kinda seeing but not super official with a guy, and we bonded immediately.  And while we talked via text, she avoided me mostly in person because I think she was afraid that something would happen between us. Now, in this story her guy ended things with her, but there's still that thought in the back of my head that she has done the same thing as my other girlfriends.\n\nSo it's hard.  I'm insecure, and I suffer from bouts of depression so it's hard to stay optimistic.  My girlfriend has been on vacation for like a month now, and I'm terrified that maybe she started talking to someone who maybe down the line she'll want to be with instead of me. It's stupid and immature and ridiculous, I know, but when you get hurt a bunch you want to just cover your heart. \n\nAnd I want to trust her. I just don't exactly know how in this matter. She's much more attractive than me too, absolutely beautiful, I just try to do my best to be a good guy that she wants to be with. Just have that fear in the back of my head, I don't know why. We've been together for over 6th months too, if that's any help. \n\nThanks for you help.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Why can't I make female friends that I connect with (19F, college)\nPOST: I've ALWAYS had a hard time making friends...always sat alone awkwardly in middle school and through some of high school. Once I got over my shyness (11th grade), I would say that I became likable, slightly out there, and funny. But even then, there was still something preventing me from making close friends. 12th grade, I met my boyfriend, and we connected extremely well. I became friends with his friends (not close) and lost my previous friendships. Still BFF's with my boyfriend. Now I'm a sophomore in college, I made a lot of male friends, some are quite close (and also mutual friends w boyfriend). Since college, my life has been a giant sausage fest which isn't necessarily a bad thing but also not optimal. \n\nI've tried making friendships with girls but they failed or didn't become CLOSE. I feel like it's really hard to click (difference in interests, sense of humor), and I feel like I have to hide or can't express a lot about myself (like music interests, fashion, marrywanna use). Especially at the school I attend (rigorous Engineering school), I find it hard to find girls who are similar (not trying to generalize) because most of the girls I meet are very studious and \"nerdy\" (can't put it any other way) or consumed by sorority life. I can't seem to have conversations with them outside of grades/school. I want female friends who like the same stuff as me or at least I can be 100% comfortable around!11! \n \nAlso about me: I have pretty low self-esteem even though I think I have a unique, funny personality.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by leaving my windows open. During winter. In Boston.\nPOST: Let me start out with a little bit of context. I'm originally from the Panhandle of Florida and have never seen more than a few inches of snow in my entire life. I moved to Boston in August with my girlfriend. I stayed with my old job - but they don't have an office up here, so I've been working from home.\n\nAs anyone from Boston (or the NE, in general, can attest), it gets cold. Super cold. Colder than I've ever felt in my entire life. So I figured it was kind of normal that I was super cold when sitting at my desk all day long.\n\nAt first I tried to bear it, just said \"I'll get used to it.\" But as the weeks went by, I started wearing slippers, then a puffer jacket, then a beanie, and finally I busted out some handwarmers. It's at this point that I just become miserable. Stupid New England. Stupid weather. Stupid girlfriend making me move up here. Why would anyone do this to himself?\n\nI swore up and down that there must be a draft. There's no way being this cold inside is normal. But everybody just laughed it off, \"Florida Boy can't handle the cold.\"\n\nUntil this morning when my girlfriend decided to work from home as well and commented on how unbearably cold it was in my office relative to the rest of the house.\n\nSo we started looking around to see if we could find anything. And whattya know...the top pane of the window directly above my desk has been open 3-4\" inches since we moved in. It was perfectly lined up so that the blinds obscured the very top of the window and I couldn't see it.\n\nWe just closed the window and I swear the room has already warmed up by 5 degrees.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: If you could remove a single negative character trait in today's society, what would it be and why?\nPOST: For me, it would have to be **ignorance**.\n\nWhy, you may ask? Because I feel as though a large number of today's problems are caused by the fact that many people do not want to see both sides of an argument. Ignorance is akin to not wanting to learn; you can't formulate a proper argument without understanding as much as possible about a particular topic.\n\nAn ongoing topic on reddit (and anywhere else in the world, really) is the topic of religion. I'm a Roman Catholic by birth and by faith, and although I was raised to be extremely religious and was considering at one point becoming a priest, I very much dislike the manner in which some Catholics express their views. A perfect example is my father who is very fervent in his beliefs, and where everyone else does not \"see the Truth\". While that may be true - and while we can't confirm either side of the argument at this point - wanting to know nothing else about other people's point of view makes me sick. **NOTE: This does not only apply to Catholics, but to people who are rich, poor, of different race or beliefs. It happens pretty much anywhere you look.** It also doesn't apply to everyone in said groups; I am an example of this. Maybe I'm just curious, but I like to get all of the information on a subject before making an informed decision, and even then I am always open to other people's thoughts and points of view even after making a decision.\n\nI've been trying to find some subreddit where people discuss pretty much any topic in a calm and civil manner. Instead, I've found that there's always a bias somewhere, and I wish there was an alternative. The person who said \"Ignorance is bliss\" obviously didn't see the repercussions that ignorance could bring upon society.\nTL;DR:"}

In all honesty, one was not attractive at all and I think my ego got the best of me on that one, she was ready and willing to meet up with me at a hotel as long as I paid and was willing to take her out as well, \"wine and dine\" her as she put it. I didn't think she was worth it, but in hindsight I should have gone for it.  \n\nThe other was a fairly promiscuous girl that I had been talking to for almost a year, we always talked about sex like every time we spoke and I had it on good authority that she was givin' it up to everyone else but she told me I wasn't the one, that she wanted me only as a friend. \n\nSo that's where I'm at. I have no prospects, feeling very lonley and I can't admit the fact that i haven't gotten any in almost 2 years to anyone in my circle so this was the logical next step.

I recently was put on the antibiotic doxycycline for Lyme disease and have been taking them as prescribed...although sometimes without water.\n\nLast night was one of those times.  Popped the caplet and felt it get stuck in my throat for a moment, swallowed hard and off it went.  I felt a little lump in my throat the next time I swallowed, but I attributed it to the fact that it was just because the caplet hadn't gone down the 1st time.\n\nAbout to head to bed- doing my routine which tonight included a quick squat on the toilet.  As I'm there, doing my business, thumbing through Facebook, I cough.  And a little puff of what looks like smoke comes out of my nose and mouth.  This puff is immediately followed by a sharp, burning sensation all throughout my nose, sinuses and soft palate.  I'm tearing up, my eyes are red, and I'm drinking water out of the faucet like a mad man.  The capsule had not gone down, was still in my throat, had started to dissolve and when I coughed, I dislodged it but the contents were burning me from the inside.\n\n Now I'm not just drinking water,  I'm snorting it.  The sting of water in my nostrils is *nothing* compared to the burning.  Now my nose is filling up with mucous.  I'm coughing, gagging, crying, and burning.\n\nI'm looking for saline spray with no luck.  And it's off to CVS at 1am.  On the way, I called poison control and they confirmed that saline is the way to go.  The spray helped but not much.\n\nI couldn't sleep last night because of the sinus pressure, the mucous, and the burning.  I finally passed out after taking some Tylenol at about 5 this morning.\n\nIt's about 12 hours later, I'm still stuffed up, can't smell or taste anything, and it hurts to swallow.  But now I know that they're not telling you to take your pills with water just to ease your stomach.\nTL;DR:"}

We are in a long distance relationship during the school year with us being 4 hours apart and busy with school so we see each other once a month. At the time we hadn't had sex in 4 months and before then it was maybe once a month even when we lived together in the summer.

Two weeks ago I called and told her I couldn't do it anymore and she agreed but I could tell she was annoyed. In about an hour we talked things out and the open relationship was back on. I had only gone out once with no success and nothing happened from tinder.\n\nThen last week I matched with a girl on Tinder who messaged me first and we agreed to go out on Friday. I told her I was just looking for friends or to hook up and had no desire for a relationship. We ended up hitting it off and after 3 hours of  great conversation I drove her home and then she invited me upstairs. We ended up having the best sex of my life and agreed to hangout again on Monday.\n\nNow I feel like I owe it to this new girl to tell her I am in an open relationship. Mostly because I actually really care about her and two because I could honestly see me dating her and breaking up with my current girlfriend. I know I need to either tell her Monday or just never tell her. This is only the fourth girl I've had sex with and everyone I went on to date so I don't know if I'm just unable to separate sex and emotions, in which cause an open relationship is a terrible idea.\n\nI plan on just telling her right away Monday and apologizing for not telling her earlier and letting her know I understand if she hates me and that I really do care about her and I'm not sure what is happening with the open relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

I started liking her and incidentally she started liking me back and we started dating and boy we hit it right off. I was so happy with her and for a while she seemed to feel that way too. Only last week I started feeling that she was becoming distant and cold especially during one of our dates and a few days ago she broke up with me.\n\nShe said that the reason was her. She didn't like the idea of a commitment and feels like she is not mature enough to handle a relationship and she felt that she was being unfair to me as I was really serious about it. She did not want to drag it out for longer as it would just hurt me more.\n\nI feel like that is a valid excuse but right now I am terribly sad. When she broke up she stressed many times how she really liked me as a person and thinks that I'm a great guy and loves to hang out with me. She told me that she'll give me some space (as it's summer vacation right now) and as soon as school starts, she wants to be really close friends again.\n\nThe thing is I totally feel the same way. I really like her as a person and even if we can't be dating I still want to strive to return to being really good friends. The only issue is that right now I am agonizingly sad. I think about her all the time and I'm afraid that if we start talking again and even hanging out again I'll just lead myself on and hurt myself.

Unfortunately, there was an ATM problem and the ATM threw an error during her deposit.

She deposited the $900 and then complained to the manager who never got back to her after 5 attempts to contact.\n\nWe were told the ATM would be counted out and the cash validated but she's not the only one that complained about this problem so that doesn't add up to me.  A few days later they credited the $3000 in full (in error as she received $900 of it back) but took back the $900 error a week later.  At this point, we assumed all was settled.\n\nFast forward to today (well over a month after we assumed it was done) and her personal account is down $3000 that they took back and we'll have to cover it with our savings in the meantime.  Is there any recourse for this?  Is there any mechanism to prove the original deposit?  Are we stuck at the mercy of the bank manager's kindness to trust us?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: On dealing with the effects of infidelity.\nPOST: My girlfriend and I, both of us are 20, have been together for nearly three years. We started dating before senior year of high school, moved away to college together with some friends, and had a generally smooth relationship up until January. We went through a little bit of trouble, which became extremely exaggerated when my best friend, and one who moved to the college town with us, confessed to her that he's loved her throughout our relationship. She reciprocated the sentiments and I was at a low point of my life, ashamed for sneakily looking at Facebook messages, and especially seeing the two people closest to me conspiring to leave me to be together. Calling her phone repeatedly, without answer, while I knew that they were together at her apartment that night was awful.\n\nWe argued a lot and eventually decided to work it out. She never touched him or anything like that. They had one face-to-face conversation, and it involved her telling him that she really wanted to be with me. I understand that stress makes people do stupid things, and I have been trying to forgive her. \n\nLast night, she went to a party. I don't suspect her of cheating on me at all, as I do mostly trust her. But she has a habit of not paying attention to her phone. That bothers me. I've told her that I would appreciate a text back every once in a while when she's out, and a lot of that is just me being worried about her at a party. She got mad at me for not trusting her, and doesn't seem like she wants to deal with the consequences of what happened in January. Plus, she's telling me that it was a long time ago, and it shouldn't really be an issue anymore. \n\nI don't **completely** trust her. I've been hoping that it would come back over the last few months, and it mostly has, but there's still a void. For the past few weeks, the relationship has been great again. But, reasonably in my opinion, the love triangle thing fucked with me and the effects are still present. I don't know what the best course of action is. I love her. She loves me. But I don't completely trust her, and she seems like she's running out of patience.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Not sure if I should tell her how I should go about doing it.\nPOST: We started out just having a lot of mutual friends. She's a solid seven years older than me, so I wasn't worried about anything. Sure, she was pretty, but I'm still a teenager and I have a long way to go.\n\nWe started talking and spending time together and eventually she became a confidant. I told her about my problems, my worries, my crushes, etc. I eventually I developed a crush on her. I really had it for her, but my friend helped talk me out of it. That was more than a year ago.\n\nNow, I'm not so sure it's a crush. Usually with those I'd get over it kinda quick. But even when there was another girl I was getting to know, I couldn't stop thinking about this one.\n\nThing is, I'm not just drooling over her being pretty. I can honestly name things about her personality that I love and admire. While there have been other girls that have caught my eye, I never really stop thinking of her. I tried to stop it by telling myself it can't happen. I tried cutting off most contact with her, but I miss her terribly. \n\nWe share common interests in entertainment, hobbies, recreation, and we just get along. We can joke and laugh and talk for hours and we never run out of things to say. Honestly, it's at the point where it's hard to picture myself with anyone else.\n\nI'm just not sure if I should tell her. Granted, I don't plan on telling her RIGHT NOW, but maybe in a couple of years when I'm 18. But she's seven years older than me. I don't want to go and confess my love to her and then have things weird between us. What's more, I work with her father sometimes. In fact, to a certain degree he's in charge of me. I don't want to ruin my relationship with her, or her family.\nTL;DR:"}

The next morning I was scared and looking all over her (imagining the worst) and ended up tracking her cell to a hotel. Where she was with someone else. I waited in the lobby for 3 hours until she came out. Once confronted she did the casual \"this is your fault, you forced me to do this\" routine. I believed it. Apologized. And it wasn't until I was halfway home I realized, wait what? But yeah. Fast forward 2 weeks she's still texting the person she cheated on me with. Snapchatting, pics, who knows. I can't be sure what they're saying. But everything is all my fault. How did \"I let our relationship come to this\" or how I \"never treated her right the past month\" etc etc. Usual things Cheater's say, although I do give it some merit. Maybe I wasn't the best. But I would never step out of the marriage. So we're making it work. She says she has a lot of \"thinking to do\". All while she continues to message this other person. My question is, is the messaging between them still cheating? Do I have a right to be angry that she continues a relationship behind my back with the VERY SAME person she cheated on me with? I feel like it's and obvious answer, but when confronted she has a way with words to make me feel like the she's the victim. Please help Reddit.\nTL;DR:"}

What I have begun to struggle with is the frustration about me needing him to understand how I operate and solve problems.  We end up in heated conversation sometimes, because small issues tend to be ignored.  Whenever I bring up something that bothers me, he shuts down and stops communicating, so nothing ever seems to get solved.  He always wants a day to think and decide what his next move is.  I cannot ignore a problem/argument for a day and pretend like nothing has happened.  I really need to talk about something we have feuded about in order to process it.  He is the exact opposite.

But, we hadn't met families yet. I thought we were moving towards the whole exclusivity stage.. but I was wrong. When we first met he mentioned how he wanted to move in the future, but never had a timeline or anything. Then about a week or so ago when I was over, out of the blue he told me he was moving and planned to have his place packed up by the end of the month. By moving I mean to another state. I was completely shell shocked. I confronted him later that night through text because I was too shocked to do it face to face earlier. We decided to still continue to talk until he moves. \nwe have been talking every day since then, and the other night he even told me \"goodnight beautiful\".

I already feel like this was a bad idea. I know nearly half of the people the other half consists of total strangers. Fast forward an hour later, my party boy friend tells me \"dude, we should meet up fore often, you are missing almost half of the parties. Why are you in such a sad mood,you should be more alive\" The thing is I've been having some psychological problems for the past five years and didn't mention any of it to my friends. So I go like \"Things have been quite difficult lately. I'm trying to make things right.\" And all of a sudden I don't know why the fuck but I said \"I was raped\". Keep it mind that I'm a 26 years old straight dude. At this point every fucking person in the house went total mute. Everyone is looking at me.

We became fast best friends last year, and that developed into a strong relationship where we pretty much spend all of our time together and both greatly enjoy the company of the other for 18+ hours/day.

Usually we're incredibly happy together, but recently him telling me \"I'm sorry I'm wasting your time/Do you actually still want to be with me?\" has become a lot more frequent (from about once every four months to every two weeks).

First, it was false advertising because the seller had listed the product as \"new\". Second, is it even legal to resell a unit with an enterprise or volume license from an organization or company to someone outside of said organization or company?

I would tell him constantly how amazing he is to me, as he would do the same for me.\n\nNo one has ever known me as well as he does. He's my best friend and my first love. We had the perfect summer romance, like something out of a sappy movie. We communicated well and respected each other's space. I know that I can move on, but I also know that I'll always love this man on some level. I know that I have my whole life ahead of me, but I'm scared that I'll never find someone like him again. Sure he has flaws, but we were happy and I've never felt so cherished in my life.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by reversing into my mother's car.\nPOST: Last Saturday, at around 10:30pm, I was lucky enough to go out with my parents and buy a car. I was pretty excited about this, since I passed my test months ago but didn't think I'd have a car any time soon, due to lack of funding. So we bought the car, drove it home, enjoyed the freedom of traveling to places without the limitations of bus routes or walking. Everything was pretty sweet and I couldn't wait to show it to my friends at sixth form on Monday.\n\nThis morning, I fucked up. I was running late. I quickly packed my stuff, chucked it in the boot and was ready to leave in my shiny, second hand car. As I was reversing out of my awkward driveway, I was doing my best to avoid a hedge. While focusing on one side of the car, I'd completely blanked the other side and didn't see where my mum's car was parked. As I hastily reverse, I am suddenly startled by a loud \"CLUNK!\" Shortly followed by the sound of scraping metal against metal. Stupidly, I panic and don't stop reversing. All that I'm thinking is \"FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK\" as I watch my car pushing my mum's car across our gravel driveway. As this continued, the wing mirror of my car fell off, I stalled the engine and remove myself from my car, petrified. \n\nMy mum comes out of the house, screaming \"What the hell was that?! Are you alright?!\" She quickly realizes what has happened. She doesn't yell at me, instead she just seemed disappointed, looked up and asked me \"Shit, Ben. What have you done?\" \n\nWe take a moment to assess the damage. The corner of her rear bumper is completely caved in. My wing mirror is snapped off, and to top it off, I have a large dent and scratch mark all the way along the side of my car.\n\nWe taped up the mirror quickly and I arrived at school 15 minutes late... After doing a U-turn half-way because I forgot I had told my girlfriend that I'd give her a lift.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Is it possible to replace the sexual aspect of my (23F) boyfriend (24M) with porn?\nPOST: I love my boyfriend dearly.  We've been dating almost two years.\n\nWe were both virgins when we met and very slow to do anything sexual, at least by modern standards.  Our sex life is handjobs/fingering, though we've had PiV a couple of times and I've given him oral sometimes.  \n\nWe're currently long distance for the summer (both in grad school and living with parents in different states).  Recently (the last six months or so) we haven't had much of a sex life.  I feel like I have to beg for him to do anything, and he's said he's felt coerced.  \n\nI decided to have one last talk with him about it.  He says (and he's been saying this for a while) that he's not interested because I have low self-esteem and cry about myself a lot.  It's true, I do, but most of that low self-esteem is caused by him not wanting me.  How am I supposed to feel pretty or worthy?  It's a vicious cycle.  Also, I find it really hard to believe that this inhibits his sexual attraction to me.  Is sexual attraction about attitude and self-esteem as well as looks?  Because I've always felt like he's just saying this because I'm ugly.\n\nNow, about the porn.  I've never watched or read porn before.  He used to watch it before we met, but gave it up when he started dating me (he saw it as infidelity).  However, after hearing this from my boyfriend, that he keeps insisting my self-esteem is the reason for his lack of sex drive instead of telling me the truth, it makes me want to shelve sex forever and replace it with porn.  Would this help me satisfy my urges?  Is it a good long-term replacement?  Or is there a better way of going about this?\n\nP.S. I told him I was considering watching porn and he didn't say anything for or against it.\n\nI've been to counseling, it's helped a little, but not very much.  I'd like to solve these things myself without going back.\nTL;DR:"}

My class consists mostly of boys and then two girls. Only a few weeks after we started I started talking to the girl I was most attracted to of them, and she's a really fun person, she's sweet and I really like her.   \n   \nUp until yesterday, I thought I'd never have a shot with her, but then we went on a camping trip with the school last week and during the whole trip when I would steal a glance at her, just to look at her, I would sometimes catch her looking at me with a smile, but not the kind of smile you use when you know someone is looking at you. Some other kind of smile, and when I looked her and saw her smile, she immediately looked away.   \n   \nThen, on the bus home from the camp, she came to sit by me in the other end of the bus as opposed to the people she would normally have sat with for the entire trip, and boy was I glad she did. The whole trip home we talked and laughed and had a lot of fun.  \n   \nBut here comes the problem, Reddit, I'm not sure how to ask her out. I'm afraid that it'll be really awkward in the class if she says no, and I'm not even sure what the right place and time to do so would be, because I haven't dated anyone in five years and I suspect that the field has changed a ton since people became adults.\nTL;DR:"}

We became long distance back in April after moving home from school for the summer. Things were on the decline, I believe because we were both so complacent that we didn't think any effort was needed. She was getting too close to a male coworker for my own comfort, and after promising me she wouldn't see him alone anymore, I found out she had gone back on her promise. Found out she had lied to me about some other small things and I didn't feel that I could move forward because the trust was broken. I broke things off, and cut her out of my life.\n\nMonth later, I find out she's now dating this same guy (nothing physical had happened between them, but an emotional connection which shouldn't have developed did). I feel as though she's dating him because she knew she could get him, it helps her deal with the loss, and in part is to get back at me. Needless to say: I blew up at her, and said some really insensitive things. Now I'm blocked on social media. \n\nI am now 'realizing' that I want her back, and that I should've given her a chance to make things right.\nI do still love her, very much. But I say 'realizing' because I don't know if the loneliness is making me feel this way, or the love I still have for her.\nTL;DR:"}

I am so busy we don't talk as much and 3. my male coworkers make him feel uncomfortable. We've been working on 1 and 2, however now I have a massive problem arise with one of my other coworkers. He's 24 and is a good friend of mine, one of the rare people I can count on here. We see each other every day. He keeps my creepy boss off my back and is a genuinely good guy who I've come to love and adore as a friend.  Our relationship is as platonic as I can make it and for the most part he is respectful of our relationship. He has expressed that he is in love with me drunkenly but apologized for saying it and has said nothing afterwords. I've set strict boundaries so my boyfriend won't be uncomfortable and I can still maintain a friendship with him. However, for Christmas, my friend/coworker bought me plane tickets and court side seats to a basketball game in my hometown for us to go together. This has caused a bit of tension between my boyfriend and I as he is uncomfortable with such a lavish gift. I'm not really sure how to go about this situation without ruining a good friendship, a work relationship, or seeming ungrateful.

My family is objectively less adjusted than his, it is true, but his family is all very exceptional while my family is probably about as normal as you get, plus I really have no idea how my aunts and uncles raised their kids.

When we got back to the school, our Statistics teacher got off first and stood by watching the other students leave the bus and walk back into the school. When my friend and I walked off, the teacher said directly at us,\"Did you keep your hands off each other in the back of the bus?\" I was flabbergasted; I mean, did he think we were sexual lovers? So I responded with my own question,\"Why would we put our hands on each other?\" He doesn't respond. He continued to grin at us as we awkwardly walked away from him into the school building. \n\nI was offended, yes, for my friend and me to be assumed as lovers. No, I don't have anything against gays. I just don't want to be implicitly categorized as gay when we both aren't. We're just bros. In fact, this male teacher expresses more feminine qualities than both my friend and me combined. \n\nIronic thing is, a previous friend asked that teacher an inappropriate question, and the teacher yelled at the student. Now that teacher asks an inappropriate question. \n\nSo Reddit, what do I do? I know I should talk to him. But what should I say? Something to make him leave us alone and express that we're both offended.\nTL;DR:"}

Why do I keep freezing?\nPOST: My dating past is basically non-existent. I recently moved to a new city and met a seriously fantastic girl who went to grad school with some of my old college roommates and best friends. They would kinda joke about setting me up with her a few years before I met her, and I was always somewhat dismissive, having no idea that I would one day move to this city and get to know her well.\nTurns out, she was somewhat interested in me from the beginning (found out through others) even before I really started getting interested in her. I was afraid the window had passed, but recently I've started to see that she seems like she would still be open to something.\n\nEverything sounds awesome right? I'm just lost. I don't know how to ask her out. She's a PhD student and her schedule is super odd, but really I've hung out with her one on one multiple times now and have had several opportunities to tell her how I feel. It's intermittent though, and I don't always see her. I think the problem is I've never done something like this before. I really like her and don't want to screw it up.\n\nBasically what I want to know, should I ask her on a date...or just tell her i really like spending time with her and want this to go somewhere? I feel like a date is for getting to know someone, but I already know her pretty well at this point. She might even be frustrated I haven't said something, I don't know. Every time I'm with her and think I'm going to say something, I just freeze. The thing is, I'm not even awkward around her, like I can talk freely and have a good time (and I think she does too, because she certainly seems to enjoy being around me). I really have nothing to fear, yet I can't seem to do anything because I'm thinking too much.\nTL;DR:"}

One sunday, she slept in because us kids decided to eat cereal, not demand pancakes, and generally not be fucktards at 630am. All 4 of us went outside to wait on the porch for the Bible school van at 8am. We see the van pull up, and we jump in. Of course, we didn't think twice to tell Mom we were leaving for Bible school. All of a sudden when we close the van door, and start to pull out guess who comes barreling out of the house like a fucking Momma Bear on PCP? My mom. In her stupor she starts sprinting after the van yelling, \"WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU TAKING MY KIDS YOU FUCKING BITCH!?\" She's pounding on the van window while we children are sitting there mouth agape. To give her some credit, my aunt was starting an awful lot of trouble with CPS by making false accusations. The Sister driving us slams on the breaks. Mom tears open the van door, and immediately starts grilling her while removing kids. Finally, Mom calms down enough to listen to the lady. The sister stammers, \"I-I-I-I-I'm taking them to b-b-bible school Mame.\" Mom looks at all of us, and we see sudden realization hit her. She kisses my little brother on the forehead, lets us get back into the van, and gives a tight lipped smile, \"Of course. Of course you are. You have fun now.\" We never had to go bible school again after that sunday! We had a good laugh about this story from the neighbors perspective.\nTL;DR:"}

I recently became friends with this girl in class and we've been spending increasing amounts of time together. The chemistry is unlike anything I've experienced before - we can talk for hours (and often do) on any number of subjects and are just super in tune with each other. Our personalities feed off each other and it's clear that we could work in a relationship. We have had so many psuedo dates (dinners, going to movies, chilling in her apartment with wine, it keeps going) that we're pretty much there minus the sex. Finally, we're both (and I guess you'll have to take my word) decent looking people, dress well, etc. and would not be some completely stilted couple in the looks department (sorry if that's superficial but I think it's relevant). BUT, of course, she has a boyfriend. It's long distance, and she seems to vacillate between keen on it to somewhat resentful of the difficulty in maintaining it from so far (>1000 miles away). It is VERY clear that I'm in the surrogate BF situation, but I can't help it - I've developed very strong feelings for her. I don't want to wreck the friendship, but I can't keep up this charade forever as the fake bf. She doesn't even talk about him that much, I've only gleaned occasional slimmers of info (i.e. I don't feel like she's using me as some weird shoulder to cry on type situation).

On and off again relationship where she hooked up with a friend one night and they both lied to me about it, later during another break she again hooked up with one of my best friends during new years. Obviously I was wrong to get back together the first time but I was young and thought I was in love.\n\nFast forward to me being more stupid, not really having any plans for what I seriously wanted to do after high school and we ended up going to the same university (don't do this shit) and it was a small satellite campus (2k people) of a larger school (60k people). We also lived in the same residence so when we weren't together so things were bad, man. First year of school and freedom for a lot of kids, lots of alcohol and free time (we had a four month strike during our first year from November to Feb approx) and it's tough to see a girl you have strong, conflicting feelings with drinking up and down school and occasionally hook up with a guy. Not a great thing at all.\n\nI started closeting myself away in my room and my trouble sleeping coupled with fondness for the drink quickly turned into barely functioning alcoholism for the rest of the school year, even after classes started up again. I don't want to blame her entirely since some of this was obviously my inability to cope but her betrayals and the pain from those two friends made me feel really isolated from other people and I've never really recovered from it, never wanted to let anyone else get close. Had a few dates since then but nothing serious, of course.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been having sex using the pull-out method, but the other week I got a little excited and didn't pull out in time. Now, even though she's on the pill, she insists on me using a condom.

My achievements aren't notable in comparison\u2026 I feel extremely lost and don't know what to do with myself. I sometimes wonder why he wanted to go out with me when he's dated more successful and intelligent girls in the past.    \n  I'm also in constant fear that my boyfriend's family thinks that I'm inadequate. They're well aware of my boyfriend's impressive achievements and intelligence while I'm just an unemployed lowly humanities graduate with no real aspirations. How do I deal with this situation? How do I get over this?\nTL;DR:"}

Couldnt ask for a better woman to spend the rest of my life with.

I plan on proposing regardless, but if there is a best way to work with my parents on this, how can I at least try to either get them on board or at least soften their disappointment? They are some of the best people in my life but I don't think they read the situation right, and it's awkward every time I try to bring this stuff up.

I would seriously like some advice of a problem I am currently facing. Its been 6 months since I've\n \"  ended\" my relationship with my girlfriend(16) . (Note: it was a long distance relationship via messages and calls) Our relationship lasted for 6 - 7 months. During our relationship, I've purchased and made gifts for her during special occasions. (Gift Cards, Drawings etc). She never really bought me any gifts, but I didn't mind, as I wanted her to save  money for herself. However, I felt something small like a drawing or card would've at least made me feel like the relationship wasn't as one-sided. During the 5th month of our relationship, things began to slow down.  On her 16th birthday, she started to message me, but I never responded as I felt our relationship wasn't going anywhere. Her friend messaged me calling me a series of curse words, which was totally understandable. For several months, I've felt an extreme amount of guilt. I've basically fucked her  sweet 16th birthday. \nI've never had the courage to message her again. Since its been a year since I've confessed to her, she's been leaving status messages in Chinese saying things like \"I miss you\". I am quite certain that she doesn't currently have a boyfriend, so this message was probably meant for me. Anyways, as mentioned before, I'm feeling a lot of guilt for leaving her.\n\nWas I wrong? Should I apologize? Should I ask for an apology? I would really appreciate any help from you guys. (Er, sorry if this isn't proper etiquette, this is my first time posting in this sort of forum).\nTL;DR:"}

During our journey I thought that it was the funniest thing in the world to playfully but persistently stab my companion's shoulders with the triangular ruler.

I proceeded to make fencing- and stabbing-motions towards the vehicle, all the while shouting out mock threats and war cries.\n\nThen, very rapidly, a guy got out of the car and started shouting back at me, asking what the hell was wrong with me. Turns out that it was an undercover cop/cop dressed as a civilian. He wasn't very amused by the fact that a drunk little shit had challenged him to a sort of deranged duel.\n\nVery quickly I felt rather sober and adopted a formidably humble demeanor while he yelled at me for what felt like quite some time.

After about 6 months of being single and getting over the past relationship I decided to try to get fit again and try to date and find someone who I could actually form a healthy relationship with. During this 6 month period I gained a fair bit of muscle and reverted back to my body type of doing several sports a week. Keep in mind before this process I was fairly average (I.E I wasn't overweight just not \"fit\").\n\n...\n\nWhat I didn't expect was to be met with a huge amount of entitlement and hypocrisy. While dating I found that many girls have a prince charming fantasy and don't actually want much more than a guy who is anything other than a stereotype. Of the girls I've met a number of them were initially very interested but eventually ended up with the \"bro\" type other than myself.\n\n...\n\nUsing a few dating sites I determined that very few people look at anything past your pictures. I tested this using two otherwise identical profiles only swapping out a picture of myself from before and after I got fit. The difference was literally 5+ messages a day (fit profile) to nothing (average profile). I experimented further and removed any semblance of information about myself from the fit profile and these numbers increased. This was mirrored in all other forms of dating as the less I told someone about myself and the more sarcastic/witty I acted the longer I would end up dating someone. I'm the kind of guy who loves to talk and have deeper conversations, loves poetry, and even has a soft spot for romance in general. What I've determined is that apparently this is unattractive...\n\n...\n\nAs a side note: no, I don't reveal the romantic side of myself in an odd way, most of the people I've gone out with invite me to hang out with them afterwards as a \"friend\", they just aren't interested any longer.\n\n...\nTL;DR:"}

The story is down below\nPOST: I was friends with this guy in the beginning, then in a relationship for a bit. We were long distance and had other stuff going on so we mutually agreed to \"just be friends\". We still had feelings for each other though and it was pretty obvious. He came back to the country (he was overseas for work) and told me he still had feelings for me and asked me to come over.\n\nThen, a week later, I found out he met someone new. It blind sided me and came out of nowhere. On top of that, the way he said it made not want to even remain friends with him. Had he said it differently I might have considered being just friends with him. So I decided the best thing to do was to say goodbye for good. It's been a few weeks now. I hear about people getting back into each other's lives after ending things.\n\nHonestly, I feel like being friends (just friends at most) with him. I don't want to reach out to him again, considering what happened, but I won't completely rule that out either. I'm not sure if I should just move on or give this a try at least. I wouldn't regret trying, as long as it's not a really dumb choice. I'm ok with either way really, just want to know what's the best decision for me. I've asked my friends for their feedback already. I thought it might be a good idea to ask this big community. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! First time posting on Reddit, so the format might be a bit off, bear with me!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: 22 year old recent college grad with a full time job, should I move out of my parents' house?\nPOST: I graduated this past May and have been working at my new full time job for about 2 months now. I live with my parents, I get along with them pretty well, and my job is a 25 min drive away, so my situation is pretty convenient right now. However I've been considering moving out and renting an apartment with a friend somewhere nearby, and I cannot decide whether or not this would be a stupid move right now. My gross annual salary is about $80k, and rent would probably be in the $600-$800/month range (not including utilities and other bills). Additionally I have no loans of any kind so that's not something I need to worry about.\n\nMy reasons for wanting to move out include the simple fact that after 4 years living away at college, it's a little weird/annoying to have my comings and goings being constantly monitored. I get along with my parents but there are a few points of friction when it comes to our worldviews/lifestyles, and while there haven't been too many conflicts in the last 6 months I've been at home, I'm afraid that after enough time there will be. I've also been the biggest BUM living at home since I know that my parents will do everything for me, and I feel like my motivation to do anything outside of work has been sapped completely. I just feel like my parents' house is where I've always come to veg out and get away from everything, but now that I'm living here, I am in constant veg mode, and it's preventing me from achieving my personal/professional goals and hindering my growth as a fully formed adult person.\n\nOn the flip side though, I understand the importance of saving while young and since I'm fortunate enough to have a full time job without having any major financial obligations or responsibilities, I can see how living at home could potentially put me ahead financially in the long run. I'd also likely only be moving 15-20 minutes away from home, with only limited improvement to my current commute.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest\nTITLE: Crushes are stupid.\nPOST: I'm 18, female, and leaving for college in two months. I haven't had a crush for like 3 years. I was in relationships back to back, and I found my freedom about 8 months ago. My last ex was horrible, he didn't treat me like a human. So I decided to pass on the relationships for awhile. Flirted with some guys, had some fun, loving life. I work in a deli / bakery in a mid-sized grocery store. I usually work our close shift, coming in at 2 or 3 usually and working until 8 - 8:30 p.m, except on occasions they need me and the weekends, and usually a day shift on Fridays. A few weeks ago my boss wanted to go on vacation, she had days to use and stuff she wanted to get done around her house. So asked me if I'd take all her shifts, I wasn't working much and I wanted the hours so I said yes. We always get our lunch rush, which isn't always a rush, when our regulars come in for lunch. From the various construction, cement layers, fruit packers, different business around the our small city. One day while I'm up at the counter walks in tall, dark, and handsome. My reaction to guys since I found my freedom was either, \"Hmm pass\" or \"Damn I'd tap that!\". Not this guy. He evoked deeply buried emotions, that I didn't dig a big enough hole for. Hasn't failed, he's come in every Friday and we exchange friendly conversation. My plan was to not date anyone. Flirt, have fun, maybe get laid here and there, then go crazy in college. This guy is fucking it all up, he's making me feel all these emotions, and I hate it. I like him and I hate it. I see him once a week when he comes in every Friday for lunch. I want to pursue something with him because I haven't felt anything this strong in a long time, but he's also between 25-30, which isn't a big deal to me but seems to freak people out. What I want is flat out all the perks of dating without actually dating him. Now I don't know what to do with my life.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [20/m] Not sure how to approach this situation with a girl [19/f] I knew growing up\nPOST: I knew this girl when I was in late middle school and we were good friends for about three years until I moved away. I went back to visit her once when I was a freshman in high school and we had hung out and even told each other that we liked each other but not much happened after I left. I recently managed to meet up with her because I was in the area visiting some family friends. So I messaged her on Facebook to see if she wanted to get together and she said yes. We had a great time together and what was just old friends hanging out quickly turned into a date. I even ended up kissing her at the end of the night. We live in different states a few hours away from each other and are both attending college. I have kept in contact with her through texting and we even video chat sometimes. We have also been planning on meeting up sometime soon. I want to pursue a relationship with her but I do not know how to approach it because it sounds a tad crazy to me. I am not even sure how girls feel about long distance relationships in college. Any advice on what to do? Thanks in advance for any feedback!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [California] Employer didn't pay sick hours, fired me a few days later\nPOST: I worked in the food business for about a year, and I had 10 hours of paid sick hours. I requested to use them on a friday I was supposed to work, boss said okay, and that was that. Two weeks later I got my check and saw that none of my sick hours had been used, and I wasn't paid for that day. I talked to him about this, he apologized. I had to go back for more x-rays anyway that following Friday, so I told him I was going to use them, and he said okay and that he was going to talk to HIS boss to figure out how to do it.\n\nSure enough, friday comes around, the weekend goes by, and on monday he has me sign the papers to verify I was using 8 hours of my paid sick time. That following wednesday I turn in my two weeks notice since I got a new job. That friday he told me I was fired, and when I picked up my final check that following tuesday, sure enough none of my sick hours had been used and I wasn't paid for that time.\n\nI have all the text messages and facebook messages saved, although I'm pretty sure he just threw away whatever paper it was that I signed. Is there anything I can do about this?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [21F] have stupid jealousy issues and need some help dealing with them.\nPOST: EDIT: [Update](\n\nHi /r/relationships!\n\nI've [21F] been with my boyfriend [23M] for about 2 years. It's been a great time so far. We love each other.\n\nOther than the normal small stuff, my boyfriend has absolutely been a model SO. I think he's a great guy, he thinks I'm a great girl, and it's mostly a great time.\n\nHowever, I've discovered over the past year or so that I have some massive jealousy issues. I get jealous when he interacts with girls, especially attractive ones. I consciously try not to act on my feelings, because I can tell that they are ridiculous. In my head, I'm like, jealousgf, you're being silly! But honestly, the feelings of jealously are there.\n\nI don't even know where this is coming from. I've never been cheated on before, and my boyfriend is incredibly loyal. He's never given me reason to doubt his faithfulness. I get self-doubt like everyone else but I don't think it's extreme enough to cause this kind of unreasonable jealousy (I'm reasonably attractive and intelligent). Maybe there's more lurking under the surface?\n\nSo, aside from therapy which I can't afford for now, what can I do to help with the jealousy feelings in the mean time? I don't like them, and I think they're something I can work out. I'm just not sure how.\n\nI apologize if this is a question that comes up a lot here! I'd appreciate any advice.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Where are the best  places to live inside the  US?\nPOST: So I need to get the hell out of the shit hole town I currently live in. I want to start over so anywhere inside the US goes, but I'm literally clueless as to where I'd like to live. I do know the number one thing that is important to me is being around intelligent, open minded, independent thinkers, so essentially I want to live in a place with a community like that of reddit. Where people enjoy discussing things that actually matter; such as politics, science, technology. Where people have a sense of humor deeper than the sun drop girl commercials(this is currently a hot topic around here). Where people aren't afraid to be themselves. BUT of course there are other contributing factors to making somewhere a good place to live. So what does the internet think? What are the best places to live taking into account not only what I mentioned but any input you may?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [22 F] relationship with my boyfriend [24 M] is my first relationship and first love, and it's going great. I'm terrified of never knowing anything else.\nPOST: Hello r/relationship! I'm using a throwaway because I'm pretty sure my boyfriend knows my normal username.\n\nSome background: I met my boyfriend through a mutual friend while I was in my junior year of college and he was living and working in our hometown. He didn't go to college, but our towns were only about an hour away from each other. I fell hard for him fast, and so did he with me. \n\nWhile I was in school, we had a long distance relationship during the week until one of us visited the other on the weekends. We spent the entire summer together before my senior year. I decided to move back to my hometown after graduation, and we moved in together. It's been about a year and a half since we started dating.\n\nHere's my dilemma: this guy is amazing - kind, sweet, selfless, handsome, hard-working - and I love him. But he's my first love, and my first relationship. I lost my virginity to him, and even had my first kiss with him (I'm a super late bloomer). He's my first encounter with any kind of affection from another person. It's been a whirlwind of emotions and experiences for me. \n\nMy boyfriend has been in several relationships before and has loved before, and he's positive that he would be happy spending the rest of his life with me.\n\nI'm afraid that if I stay with him, I'll be missing out on other experiences with other people. I do not want to cheat on my boyfriend; I love him too much to hurt him like that. I also don't really want to break up with. I just want to know how to process these feelings. \n\nWhat if I don't really know what I want or what I like without other relationships to compare my current one to? What if I am just enamored with the novelty of a first relationship? I'm terrified that the only reason I'm with him is because I don't know anything else. He's been in love before, and he knows what he wants. I don't know if I know what I want.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, I am desperate and humbly kneel before you, begging for help.  I have one week to become a photographer.\nPOST: Some time ago I met a girl that I really like. She does some modelling, so in a moment of sheer inspiration or lunacy I asked her if I could photograph her for an assignment. She was really keen and said that she would love to model for me. The problem is... I don't actually study photography. I just wanted an excuse to hang out with her. So, I don't have a camera with a huge lens or any knowledge of how to set up a photo shoot. I know, I'm an idiot. But, can someone please help me get through this? She won't be expecting great things - because I said it was for an assignment, not an international advertising campaign.\n\nIf anybody could help me wing this, I will give you all of my internets, and be extremely grateful.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: (23m) needs opinions of (25f)\nPOST: So I have been engaged to my fiancee for 2 years now and I just found out that she says that kissing a male or female does not qualify as cheating. What is cheating to her is anything past that. I on the other hand think that anything physical or even online flirting is cheating. She told me that she had made out with one of her coworkers (39m) over the weekend. Which is why the two of us are \"taking a break\". I was cheated on in the relationship before her and everything in my current relationship seems to be going the same way as my previous one. One of the worst things is that we moved out together (2 months ago) and there would be no way i could pay all the bills without her. I still do love her and i want to try to talk some sense into her about what cheating is to me. I am just lost and need some help to figure out what to do about all this.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Dog Suddenly Scared of Being Outside\nPOST: Last night, my girlfriend and I had our 11mo old rescue beagle/terrier (we've had him for 6mo) at the dog park we've been to plenty of times. He had been running and being chased by other dogs for about 12 minutes. After getting some water and resting, we decided to walk with him around the park off leash, something we've done plenty of other times. As we started walking, he started to limp off his back left leg, ran a quick circle with his tail between his legs and came right to our feet, not wanting to move. We noticed something wasn't right so we picked him up and left to go home. After getting home, he was very scared and unsure of everything. He stood in one spot in the apartment for about 10 minutes until I moved him. He wasn't interested in toys or treats. After about 30-45 minutes we got him to eat a few treats and he eventually ate his dinner on his own. \n\nUpon taking him out before bed last night, he seemed fine, we got about halfway down our street and he hopped his back end and seemed all scared again and would just lay down in the grass. He did pee, but after that he didn't want to move and I had to carry him back to the house. He slept fine all night and isn't showing any signs of injury either.\n\nThis morning, he was the same outside, he peed, but I couldn't get him out of our driveway. He just laid down in the grass, tail between his legs, sorta limping. We inspected him all over and didn't see any scratches, cuts, bites or stings. He's usually very playful, happy, curious puppy, so the way he's acting is very uncharacteristic of him which has us concerned. \n\nAny idea what happened? How can we get him to feel more comfortable outside so he can do all his business?\nTL;DR:"}
