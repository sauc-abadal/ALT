That was in the first couple months of our relationship.\n\nNow, things have cooled off considerately which would be expected to a certain extent, getting out of the honeymoon stage, but I find myself less and less turned on.\n\nShe is obsessed with makeup, which isnt a problem. What is is is that even though her skin is flawless, she doesnt wear any around me anymore. It's not that I like her better with makeup, it's that she doesnt put the effort into her appearance for me anymore.\n\nOther things like not showering before seeing me and her nails are getting long are bothering me as well. She doesnt repulse me, I love her, it's the lack of effort that is turning me off.\n\nThis in addition to the lying back and expecting me to initialize anything sexual has lead to a dropoff in sex.\n\nHow can I bring it up without hurting her feelings?\nTL;DR:"}

Today I had to do some errands after going to the gym so it took me a while to get to a shower, which bugs me because I have a fear of getting jock itch...It isn't something you want to deal with twice. So I was anxious to get out of the tight, dirty compression shorts and have a nice shower to keep my lil' guys out of harm's way.\n\nSo I finally got home, took a shower, got all squeaky clean and everything, but I had to go the extra step. I wanted to be as dry as could be, for the sake of my nads, in the resistance of jock itch. So I decided to take my Vornado fan, crank it to the max, and let my junk flap in the wind like a flag on a windy day. The only catch is that my fan has no cover on it anymore...I was getting a little bored, so I switched the fan to my left hand and started checking my phone with my other hand, and slowly I let the Vornado drift towards the danger zone.\n\nAll of a sudden, my dick gets snagged in between the blades. It must have done at least three full circulations with the fan before I could let go. You literally could have done jump rope with my dick. I uttered some horrible squeal, dropped the fan right on my toe. The fan shattered. I fell to the ground. My mom rushed into my room to see me crumpled up on the ground naked with my dick throbbing the color of a hotdog. I am still mentally recovering.\nTL;DR:"}

Honestly, I love her, but we aren't saying that to each other yet so that's just a side note. The only downside of everything is: she is not a great kisser, and her blowjobs are pretty crappy. \n\nI get the blow jobs. I wouldn't want to do it, personally, but she actually likes giving them. Still, they always seem unenthusiastic so I never really want them. First world problem, I know. I've thought about us taking oral sex lessons or something. I figure her going to a class and me going to one also, for 'both of us to improve' (but also as a way of improving the situation without her really knowing). However, I'm willing to live with this because hey, it's a blowjob and that's amazing as is.\n\nWorse than that though, is the fact that she isn't a great kisser. She very shy with her tongue and it's like open close open close sort of stuff. It just doesn't really get me going.\n\nI figured I was the problem and maybe just wasn't getting her into it enough, since sometimes she was great in the past--but now it's always the same...even when she is 'hot and heavy'.\n\nI want to talk to her about it, but I don't want to make it awkward and embarrassing for her (and myself). \n\nMaybe it's me, I don't know. Really, I feel like a total asshole for even typing this. Any advice would greatly be appreciated though. Thanks for reading.\nTL;DR:"}

My co-worker told me to go cash my check at the bank across the street to go check out this \"ugly\" teller. I was going to deposit it into MY bank but I had to have a look. A bit rugged in the face but she had some great boobies :) She was actually fairly actractive and really nice.

She hits a parked truck. She looks up at me, I glare back, and she decides to just drive away. I got her plate, make, and model. I had a dilemma. Normally I would have no problem leaving a note with that information. But she was just an old lady and didn't do much damage. But then I thought, what if I was 20 steps ahead of myself, that could have been me she hit. Then I figured I would just let the owner decide on his own what to do. I left the note. Just as I was driving away I noticed him walking to his truck so I got his attention. I let him know what happened and he even seemed like it was no big deal since she didn't do much. But then he let me know he was actually a police officer and wanted my name and number because I was a witness. I totally felt like a dick.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: F/16 determined to complete my weight loss journey after a 2 year plateau\nPOST: I haven't lurked this sub for long, so sorry if I violate any sub rules. \n\n Ever since I was a little one, I have been overweight. I attribute that to the fact that I ate the portions of an adult male and watched Power Rangers all day. I was my heaviest at age 11. At 5'2\", I was about 150 lbs, maybe even closer to 160 as I never weighed myself. In the winter of 2012, I started running and, gradually, eating less. My weight dropped to 130 nearly overnight. Today I am still at the 130 lbs mark, and while I'm pretty happy where I am, I'd like to drop to and maintain 120 lbs. I don't strictly count calories, but I'm very aware of everything that goes into my mouth. As for exercise, during school I'm not as active as I'd like to be, with the exception of Ultimate Frisbee and home workouts. One issue is that I have difficulty finding weight loss advice that works with a high school schedule and resources. An example of this is that I cannot make lunch for myself in the morning, so I have to eat the greasy non-filling pizza the school provides.\n\nFrom reading up on weight loss, a lot of time I see that you should never consume below 1200. Is eating less than 1200 really that harmful? I've also heard that to overcome a plateau, [some will recommend that you increase your calorie intake to about 1800-2400] which seems to go against the idea that it is simply burning more than you consume that leads to weight loss. Can someone please clarify this for me?\n\nIf there's not enough information (e.g. my diet specifics or exercise routine), I'd be happy to add some on. I don't want to overload y'all with too much.\nTL;DR:"}

My friend got really upset about it, and we basically didn't talk for a very long time. We started hanging out again recently, and I started crushing on him a little bit. We always got along pretty well, and it just sorta clicked for me. I usually don't fall for people easily, 1) because I have commitment issues, and usually never let myself actually develop feelings for anyone and 2) because I'm at a school with a 1:3 girls to guys ratio, and you never know what the intentions behind anything really are. \nAnyways... I started introducing this guy to some of my other friends, and also my flatmate. They seemed to get along really well, but from my perspective it didn't seem like anything serious was gonna happen between them.

When he first sent me a message, my first question was to ask why a 34 year old male would bother with a 21 year old female. His response was open and honest--all the women he went on dates with were divorced and already had kids. Meanwhile, he was sacrificing his personal life for school. I believed him and appreciated the genuine answer.\n\u00a0\n\nOver the two months that we have spent together, we have gone to water parks with his niece, football games, trips, and I met his whole family. He has some family issues that I won't go into for anonymity. Basically he has plenty of reasons to be hurt and upset by his family's actions but has coped well. Or so I thought.\n\u00a0\n\nI understand that he cannot let emotions affect his decisions at work and has to be professional, stoic, calculated. But even at home, he refuses to express emotion. I am not allowed to ask \"how are you feeling?\" or \"what are you thinking about?\" or \"how was your day?\" He only gets angry and then won't respond for a few days.\n\u00a0 \n\nI love him, I really do, but I have never been in a relationship where my partner refuses to open up to me. I thought that it would just take time for him to talk to me about how he's feeling.

Nothing really new of note there, but we somehow got started on the topic of what happened after the marriage ended and what happened before I came into the picture relationship wise. Bad idea, but my curiosity got the better of me at that moment in time. \n\nNothing really threw me off, some randoms here and there, except from January-April of this year she was fuck-buddies with this doctor in his 40s.

Before the marriage we dated for two years. I love him immensely but lately an issue has come up and I'm not sure how to handle it.\n\nBefore marriage we had sex a few times. Usually these lined up with celebrations of major events or things like that (birthdays, etc.) I'm sure other couples have had sex a lot more often but neither of us had high libidos or complained about it.\n\nSince the marriage the frequency of sex has picked up mostly due to me initiating more often. However, another change occurred in that Brian started crying soon after we were done. A few weeks ago it started with him finishing, rolling over, and silently weeping. Lately it's been more aggravated and I can clearly tell what's going on. It's really just depressing to see him lie there like that but he clearly doesn't want to talk about it and it is also just a strange subject to approach. The sex itself is fine but I feel terrible seeing him afterwards.\n\nShould I approach him about this or just leave him alone? What could have brought something like this about? \n\nNo Scrubs jokes, please. I know there was an episode about this. It's not as funny when your partner is the one weeping next to you.\nTL;DR:"}

This seems inappropriate although my brain feels scrambled after this affair.

And we don't live in the nicest neighborhood either. I have no clue what he was on, but he could not speak clearly or stand straight. I know he wasn't drunk, because I've seen him drunk countless times; he was definitely on something. With this latest incident, it only leads me to think he has a serious drug problem. About 5 months ago we found a spoon and needle in his jacket pocket, but he claims the jacket was his friends. Not to mention his paycheck is gone within four days, and he sleeps for a solid 12+ hours every day. I know he smokes weed, but I think he is doing more than that. I KNOW he is doing more than that. I seriously need some help reddit, how can I get to my brother? How can I show him he's wasting his life away? My parents have threatened to kick him out, but to no prevail.

But it's been years. I've tried to coax him into just trying it once, but he always tells me it's weird and that he's not into that. But I'm not necessarily into blowjobs but I do it because I love him and I know he enjoys it. It makes me sad he refuses to extend that courtesy to me. It's making me resent him and I know it sounds silly but I feel kind of hurt by it. I've tried refusing giving him oral but I always cave because I love him so much. We don't have sex very often as it is.\n\nOur relationship is otherwise fine! I do care for him deeply, and maybe it's silly of me to be worked up over something so trivial. I don't know, r/relationships. Is this something I should just get over and forget about? I can't force him to do something he doesn't want to do.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm definitely into other girls around me and I don't want to say \"Oh, sorry, I just broke up with a girl and I'm not really looking for a relationship right now.\" and then turn around and start dating another girl.\n\nIt's hard to explain but she's just not \"my type.\" I certainly hope I'm not being superficial and I like spending time with her as a friend but I just can't see myself dating her. Physical attraction is one aspect of the situation, yes, but I've also noticed we disagree a fair amount on certain \"touchy\" subjects and I'm sure those would come up at some point.\n\nI've played around with the idea of \"just going for it\" but I honestly don't want to.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My boyfriend [24/M] and I's [22/F] relationship is being strained by his mother [55/F]\nPOST: Let me preface this by saying that my boyfriend (who I've been dating for half a year now) and his mother (who I've known for about 3 months) are both from a nation that is pretty behind, socially. Mental health issues are often ignored and even vilified, and non-European/American foreigners are looked down upon. Arranged marriages are common, and people from upper class families (like my bf) are expected to marry others from the same nation, not foreigners.  \n\nSo here's how this all started:\nI take a bunch of different medicines for my mental health/physical health issues (both are very poor), and my bf's sister saw me taking my meds one day, recognized that I had illness, and told his mom.\n\nHis mom is now telling him not to get involved with me because I'm sick, which really hurts, because I certainly didn't ask for any of this. At the same time, she is constantly picking on me for little things (walking to the bathroom while she was praying, showing any emotion other than happiness around her, etc etc), and will act perfectly normal towards me again within a few hours. \n\nNow, I wouldn't mind my bf's mother treating me like this, but the problem is that he 100% agrees with his mom, and gets mad at me for not assimilating to his culture better (because apparently she's picking on me over cultural differences). \n\nWe're getting into fights over her more and more often, and it's really hurting our relationship. What is hurting me most, I think, is that when I try to explain that some things can't be helped because of my mental illness (ex. crying in public because of a \"trigger\", I'm trying to lower the amount of medicine I take and that has made me more emotionally vulnerable) he calls my reasoning \"bullshit excuses\" and says I contradict myself, which makes my argument null.\n\nThis whole situation is upsetting me a lot, as we were so much happier before we decided to stay with his family for the summer.\nTL;DR:"}

Her step dad has become in my opinion jealous of the relationship.  She lives at home with her step dad and mom and is close to them.  \n\nSetup:\n\nThe step dad started out nice but has became less social towards me. I felt the biggest change happened when she began talking about moving out. It has gotten to the point where he is now causing un-needed drama in the our relationship and his family by completely ignoring my girlfriend after we spend anytime together.  \n\nEvidence:\n\nSome of the things that he has done are: intentionally declined tickets to entertainment events and, canceled planned outings when he felt she was spending too much time with me.  When he did these and other things he would explicitly let GF know to rub it in as a punishment.  It has become a big issue and has been a drain anytime we're together.\n\nHer:\n\nShe has reassured me of her love and that I am the best guy she has dated.  She dated some bad characters previously.  I am her first boyfriend in a few years. Word from his friends that they have \"leaked\" to GF say that he feels I did something wrong but, I am unaware of anything.  These \"leaks\" generally only occur when me and GF are hanging out via email/text.\n\nMe:\n\nI am starting to get tired of dealing with the drama.  I love the girl but I don't want to ruin her family relationships and honestly I don't want to deal with the fallout if she was completely alienated.\n\nQuestions:\n\nA. Should I end it and not be the one to destroy the relationship between her and her step dad?\n\nB. I am wondering what are the chances she is going to end up siding with him and breaking up with me?

He is very caring, understanding, and strives for the best. I truly enjoy him and spending time with him. In the eyes of my family, however, he is perhaps not the best \"catch\" for me, some reasons being that he hasn't gone to college, he doesn't have the best relationship with his family, and there must have been a serious reason for why we took a break in the first place. It's not that they don't like him--they perhaps just feel that I could \"do better,\" and should have moved on.\n\nI don't want to, though, but I'm feeling like I constantly have to live up to some expectation that they are having of me, and I'm afraid that it will have an effect on my relationship with my boyfriend.  \n\nThis is difficult for me because I have a strong relationship with my family, and I know that they want the best for me.

My closest mate needed to travel back to Brisbane to complete his degree in Nursing and as he had no friends or family here he could stay with and figuring it's high time i moved out (22 years old) we started looking for a place.\n\nI initially helped look for a place but stopped, partially due to working long hours that often required finishing late and starting early and partially due to laziness. At the time, my housemate was on a uni break but not working so had a bit of free time.\n\nFast forward to now, we moved into our second rental property (2 bedrooms, kitchen, lounge, small dining room, sleep-out). We wanted a 3 bedrooms to have more people in it. My housemate found this place as we had no 3rd person interested in moving in at the time.\n\nLast week, i was called away down to Victoria for the funeral of my grandfather but was advised last Wednesday that my housemate had told his brother he could move in, under the plan that the living room would now have doors installed and become a bedroom, my housemates room would become the living room, and the brother would take the sleep out. I was pissed off first that i hadn't had this mentioned prior and my housemate went and did it.\n\nI got back home last night to find the house in a state of semi halfway house as another friend (met a few times before) was now moving in. I was told the new plan by my housemate in front of both the new additions and found myself forced to agree (i didn't feel right telling them to just fuck off)\n\nThe two new guys leave to head out and i bring it up with my housemate, saying i was unimpressed with the way it was handled.

I fell hard for her and we made a lot of plans together for the future. We had gone on a lot of trips and made a lot of good memories and I thought there was something special here.\n\nAfter the breakup, she was very hurtful. It was a bad breakup because I got too clingy, too available, and basically killed attraction for her. I got a little demanding towards the end (like asking to hang out when she obviously didn't want to, initiating sex when she didn't want to, etc) and she dumped me hard and said a lot of mean things (calling me too skinny, bad hair, ugly, etc). She also revealed the she cheated on me with her ex and she hooked up with another girl quickly after the breakup.\n\nAbout a month after the breakup, she went back with her ex. A normal person would feel pissed I guess, but I am actually happy for her. I loved her a lot, and even though she didn't feel that attraction for me any longer, I wanted her to be happy. Don't get me wrong, the breakup hurt a lot, specially with all the ugly things she said, and everyday I think about things I could have done differently. I wish I could take some things back so it could have worked, but at the end I messed up, and I just wish for her to be happy with or without me. I rather her be happy with him than be unhappy with me.\n\nMy friends tell me this mentality will only hinder my healing process. They say I should channel anger at her because she did me wrong (cheating, lying, hooking up with a girl right after the breakup, etc). \n\nWould channeling anger at her help me heal faster?

It is sad. \n\nI have battled crushing depression and anxiety for years, beginning with the stunning brutality of that divorce.

I put on the tougher face for him when he's here, but he's very sharp, doesn't miss a thing. \n\nI have the opportunity to move away- a couple of thousand miles away. I have a job and a place to stay and caring friends waiting for me in Washington, thousands of miles away. I have no one here but my wife and son.

Sometimes this can be funny to me (when it's over small things) but when it's over stuff I really like she just dismisses it so rudely.

Then I calmly and politely asked when he thinks would be a good time to reschedule and try another day for dinner to celebrate he rolled his eyes and said \"its probably not going to happen, but we will see\" which means he thought he was completely off of the hook and didn't have to do anything. Most likely, wasn't planning to make anything up, at any time.\n\n I didn't tell him in that moment I am going to leave, I didn't want a big scene. I really cant do this one sided, I have to do everything and what is important to me gets disregarded relationship anymore. We didn't yell, he took everything I said personally, but he didn't go into full verbal attack mode due to the way I presented the argument and him easing into it anyways. He now thinks everything is back to normal, but I know in my heart that this is over for me. I don't even want to lay next to him in bed anymore, I am so disappointed in him, in me, in this whole situation. Thank you, everyone for your advice and kind words.

This is just basically a poll because I have completely lost any sense of direction. There are some other issues but I'll try and keep it simple. \nNight before last my SO went to a holiday party for work. I had to work so couldn't go. He rode with friends so he could drink. \n1. I asked if he'd be coming home or staying with the friends or someone else beforehand. He said \"who knows\" and decisively changed the subject. This bothered me because he has a history of going home with people he said he wouldn't. I want to stress that I wouldn't have been angry if he'd gone home with the friend he road with. I wouldn't have been angry if he'd said \"I'm not sure, but I'll let you know.\" I gave him the benefit of the doubt and decided he meant they just hadn't planned yet (or wouldn't til the spur of the moment) but that he'd surely inform me. \n\n2. His last response to me was at 10 pm, something mundane. I texted again a couple hours later. No response. I texted yet again around 4 to say I hoped he was OK. No response. At 6 am he texted \"lol, went to a diner.\" \n\n3. We generally text frequently. \n\nI feel really put off and turned off by this. I brought it up, saying it upset me, caused me to worry, and was rude and he acted like I was crazy. But he has always kept a tight leash on me.

Then, if it lasts to like six months or something, I'll be asked if I'd be okay with something \"more casual.\" Eventually, the girl in question tells me some variation of, \"I'm just not attracted to you/feel the same way about you, anymore.\" It's a routine, like clockwork.\n\n It's not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, but - because these conversations are usually filled with a lot of beating around the bush, and hemming and hawing - I'm left wondering what it could be. Is it something I did, or didn't do? Is it just a change of heart, on their part? It's beginning to give me a complex, and no degree of introspection is giving me a concrete answer.\n\n I do sometimes notice that, when something does become \"official\" and we say it out loud or whatever, I start to feel really self-conscious about it, and I'm sure that reflects on how I act toward them in some way - less self-assured, perhaps, and more awkward. In so doing, I stop acting like myself, which is what (I hope) most of them were attracted to in the first place. But, I don't really know how to stop that. It's doubly worse because I have Pure O OCD, so that element of self-doubt never really goes away.\n\nThen again, there are times where this isn't the case. So, I don't know. Any other perspectives to my astonishingly vague posts are welcome, because I just don't understand.\nTL;DR:"}

I've found out what the issues were and that she feels trapped in our relationship. She's at the age where she expects to feel like she should be out doing silly stuff all the time and being drunk etc, and feels guilty about it.\n\nNow a few weekends ago she was out with her friends and got pretty blato and ended up going back to her male friends house, didn't sleep with or in his bed. She isn't that type of person, and they are very good friends. The unnerving part was I'd offered her a lift home yet she chose to go there. I picked her up the next morning and unravelled the spiral of lies to find this out, she admitted it all and told me the story.\n\nFast forward to this weekend, she was out again with her friends and i texted her a bit more than usual, obviously inside i felt like something like that could happen again and i wanted to make sure. I think this made the situation even worse and it spiralled out from there. We ended up having a really long conversation and she spilled the details what was wrong. Whats frustrating about it is that she's never brought these into light before now.\n\nAt the end of it she suggested giving space for a week and not communicating and then meet up to have a chat.\n\nI can personally feel where this is going, breaks never tend to turn out so well. Now I really would like to adhere to the week break, but I have a good feeling its going to end badly like this. I'd really like to salvage the relationship and have her work out the issues with me.

Just really, really shitty days. I'll start off with telling you that we had planned for me to stay home indefinitely with our daughter who is now 19 months because financially, I can. We wanted to raise her ourselves instead of sending her to daycare (I know how lucky I am to be able to do that, and I'm so grateful.) But things in the household have been tight (but manageable) lately and I feel the need to get back into the workforce to help us out, so I've been applying to jobs like crazy. I had put everything else to the back of my mind. Now I have an interview tomorrow, which I was excited for at first, until it really hit me that this could be it and I'd be going from spending all our days together, to sending her off to someone else almost every day. The thought breaks my heart and brings me to tears...\nI just wanted to know if this was normal? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I know I'm incredibly lucky to have been home with her this long, but I'm not sure if that makes it better or worse when going back to work. I know my husband would appreciate it, but he insists that I stay home if I'm not ready. I don't think any mother is ever ready to leave their young child every day but it's something that we overcome.

I do feel like my sadness and that I have burdened her life has pushed her away.\n\nIn other views, I believe that it was because she never saw me as a partner for her future whereas I did see that in her.\n\nI am not sure how to deal with it.

I was getting razor burnt after every time I shaved, so I decided that the next I would shave my tender area, I would apply after shave lotion to it.\nFast forward to today I found that the hair around my knap sack has become unmanageable. So I decided to just mow the lawn. After doing so I took out my recent addition to my shaving arsenal - \"The Park Avenue Aftershave lotion\". I took just the right amount of it in my hand and gently rubbed it across my plain field. It started to itch a little but I just ignored it thinking it was just my skin's reaction to its antibacterial property. 30-40 seconds after that, I felt that my tender area is getting colder and after some time, low and behold the most agonizing pain I have ever had the chance to encounter in my 16 years on earth. It was as if someone had my one giggleberry in a icy cold freezer and the other one in the core of a dying star. I cringed in absolute pain, tears dropping through my eyes and jumped in hope to allay my pain which only resulted in me getting struck by the shower head.\nI tried to wash it by applying water but it didn't work, then I tried to wrap my nuts in the towel and again it didn't work and at last I tried to lessen the pain by standing in front of a fan which only made it worse by increasing the agitation.

As a evolutionary element, they are designed to be the 'pollen release' of the human race - the mechanism by which genetic diversity was transmitted from tribe to tribe; hence the hardened, physically unappealing exterior.  \n\nIn an advanced species, you need a compact capacity to procreate; but having an entirely additional physical being to accomplish this is a collosal waste of time and space.  Any colonization effort would by necessity be almost entirely female (with 'progressive' reproduction technologies it would be 100% female).  Women carry the capacity to reproduce entirely within themselves; given the right hardware it's even possible for them to interbreed.  \n\nWhile it's a little uncomfortable (as a man) - I am left to wonder, what is the point of men, particularly in the post-biological sciences world?  They aren't required in a universe dominated by machines; testosterone is an extremely volatile hormone that is used to drive the aforementioned 'lone wolf' behaviours.  Do men serve a significant purpose?  \n\nWith the right breeding programs, an all-lesbian (or asexual) female human race could have just as much genetic diversity and survability while abandoning the 'pollen carrier' half of the species that serves only to drain 'un-re-productive' (pardon the pun) resources that could otherwise be spent making more girls.  Men seem like a massively unnecessary component in making more humans.  \n\nIs there a vital positive men provide I'm missing, or will manhood be outlawed by mutual consent in the next 200 years (I being of the naive group who believe ultimately all good things will come to pass)?\nTL;DR:"}

There's a lot of exams, many works hours, intern programs, etc etc. bottom line: lots of work and studying. \n\nSo I have looked into licensing and I think I want to do it, but my issue right now is that I don't have a California Architect Board approved degree in architecture (because it was general design) and I may only get 1 or 2 years at most of credit for it in their eyes. (You need 5 years before you can even start taking the tests). I am worried working another 3-4 years until I am able to take the tests will discourage me from wanting to do it by the time it rolls around. \n\nSo. I am looking for some advice from any past, current, or future architects that either work in the field right now, or even did something completely different with their knowledge in architecture. I've known some architects that go into something completely different and unexpected (i.e. Movie set design, Disneyland, etc) and I want to kind of be inspired by that too because I am not so interested in what I am doing right now (though I do know, of course, that architecture itself is so broad too)\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: I got scammed with counterfeit money orders.\nPOST: On the 16th, I deposited 2 $975 money orders into my US Bank account. They were somewhat suspicious, so when I went in the next day I asked how long it takes to verify they are not fraudulent. The teller told me to wait 3 days to access the money to be sure. On the 19th I called the fraud department and, after voicing my concerns, was told the money was fine to access and that there were no Fraud Alerts. I proceeded to use most of the money to pay my bills, only to find that on the 29th, the money orders turned out to be counterfeit. So they debited my account for $1,950 and sent me a letter saying \"Sorry you got screwed.\" I have 3 conversations recorded from Bank reps; and 2 of those reps told me that it takes no more than 3 days for the funds to clear. They basically told me to find the crook who gave me the money orders. The problem is that that person, as one would expect, disappeared. Should the bank be held accountable to their word? Or what?\nTL;DR:"}

It was getting pretty flirty and she took my phone and started taking selfies. I didn't really care so i let her, but then she started going through all my photos. Unbeknownst to me i had saved a pic from /r/gonewild from a while back and she noticed it sitting in my gallery. Her Excited expression quickly changed to a much sadder one and she just kinda stared at the floor for a bit before talking to me anymore.

I, too, would not want my past to be used against me. But I feel hurt that I asked and he said no. I can understand why he opted not to tell me. But I have respect for people who do uncomfortable things to maintain honesty. \n\nIt also does not seem to have been a one time thing, but rather a sort of frequent by my standards (twice a year, for many years, when I assume he was single).

We have been together for a total of about 3 years, to give some background. My issues and advice I am needing is how to cope with our lifestyles...and if I am being completely unreasonable. I am currently a student and the degree I am pursuing is very challenging. I often don't have a lot of down time because I need to be putting forth efforts to my homework and studying. At the same time, my boyfriend is not in school and just has to go to work and that's it. This leaves him a lot of time to play, doing various activities that he enjoys. When I talk to him about the things he gets to do, I can't help but get a bit jealous that I cannot have the same lifestyle. The issue I have with this is that he often takes off work because he can, and goes and does things which means he won't be getting paid for the time he takes off. He pretty much lives paycheck to paycheck, but doesn't need to if he would just save his money. This causes a lot of issues with him being able to travel to see me, because of his lack of funds. I often am the one traveling to see him when we do get to see each other. I just don't really know how to deal with this. I want to be supportive that he is having a great time and loving life, but I feel that our lifestyles will never really mesh. College isn't in his future, and so I feel that if we are to continue this relationship, I will be the one who ultimately supports us while he gets to have his fun and I feel that is completely unfair. I want to be happy for him, but I am having a hard time doing so.\nTL;DR:"}

One where I feel like I can express my emotions without being yelled at. I am insecure sometimes yeah, but anger does not make me feel better. Maybe I am just insecure because you never show me consistent affection!!!! (Sorry I am pretending I am talking to her now).

This is the life she enjoys right now, but for me this is really hard.\n\nWhat do I do?? I've explained everything about how I feel yesterday but she wants the situation to stay the same. She told me \"I do care about you, more than you think\". But doesn't want a relationship.\n\nShould I just continue hooking up with her and hope that eventually she sees what she's missing?

She says she needs a month or two before jumping right back into a daily thing with me, so I say fine, take some space to yourself.\n\nTurns out, she was engaged to her LDR. On top of that, she lied about seeing him - he stayed for in this city for a few days - after the time she supposedly ended it but a week before we got back together.\n\nMy trust is gone at this point, after being back together for 8 months. Who lies about being engaged? And, she regularly lied and cheated on her fiancee (who she knew all of a few months) with me. If she was so flippant about cheating and justifying it, is it time to just walk away?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: Please help with fighting female guinea pigs (xpost from /r/guineapigs)\nPOST: We've got a rather specific problem with a pair of female guinea pigs. They've been raised together from being very young and have started to play dominance games. At first we were sure it was because they were in a fairly small cage. We don't have a massive amount of space but we get them both out pretty regularly.\n\nTo try and fix the space issue we bought a double height cage with a ramp. I know, I know - after some looking around on the internet this wasn't too wise; they don't seem happy with steep ramps.\n\nWe're considering fixing up the cage ourselves to make the ramp longer and less steep but we're not sure if it's even worth doing yet - they really don't seem to get on, even for a few minutes.\n\nThe main reason I'm posting is because it doesn't seem like normal behaviour. One guinea pig is particularly dominant and the other is simply terrified. We can put them together for hours at a time and all that happens is the second pig sits in a corner completely motionless, occasionally gets chased round and generally sounds scared whenever the other one comes near. When separated the aggressive pig becomes incredibly stressed and squeals a lot seemingly out of loneliness - but the timid one gets so much happier. The aggressive one is also absolutely fine with us. She's never bitten anyone as far as I know (and they've never drawn each other's blood).\n\nI should also note that we separated them for about a week and bathed both pigs thoroughly before we reintroduced them in the new cage to remove all previous odors. This didn't seem to do a great deal. Well, they smelled a lot nicer, obviously.\n\nSo now I'm not so sure actually connecting the two cages will help. Any advice out there?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: Kitty Bone Cancer Advice?\nPOST: My 17 y/o cat was diagnosed yesterday with bone cancer in her jaw. It seems to be isolated at this point, though there isn't any way to be completely sure of course. Vet gave me the option of surgery to remove the part of her jaw with the tumor. But given her age, there are the associated concerns of surgery, recovery, and such. Additionally, she is diabetic. Though I have had her in remission for 3 or 4 years now and she doesn't require insulin. Right now, she is doing quite well, eating good, and is not appearing to be in pain (I'm aware cats hide pain very well). Even the vet commented on how well she is overall.  So, I guess I just want to hear people's thoughts. Do I put her through the trauma of surgery with the associated risks so that I can try to give her more time - hopefully healthy and happy?  Or do I let her be happy now, manage pain when it needs it, and let her go when her quality of life starts to deteriorate?  I really just want to do the best by her. If she were younger, it would be easier to just do the surgery. But given her age I am struggling to decide if the benefit to her is enough to put her through it.  But it also breaks my heart to do nothing. Any thoughts or experience with something similar with an older fur-baby?\nTL;DR:"}

By all means, we have our ups and downs, but overall we're happy. \n\nOur biggest issue is that I do not want kids (never have) and he does. Albeit not right away. He says he's happy to wait until he's 30-35 to have them. (Please do not offer up the \"You'll change your mind\" shpeel. I don't need it.) It wasn't an issue when we got together because we were young and children/marriage was so far off that it wasn't a thought. But as I age I feel more and more guilt about my desire to stay childless and stay in the relationship. As I age, I become more confident that I do not want children. I have always been honest about this with him though. I've told him since say one that I do not want children (don't want to have them, don't want to adopt)\n\nThe more guilt I feel, the more I feel like being with him is taking away from his time to find someone that he really fits with AND wants children. I don't want him to wake up at 35 wanting children, realize that I still do not, and feel like he's wasted all this time with me, waiting for me to change my mind and then start to resent me. \n\nWe don't really have any other major relationship issues. There's no cheating or abuse or anything. I'm having a hard time bringing this up with him. I keep putting it off because I'm scared and I feel like he's putting off thinking about it or discussing it because everything is good.

Some others discovered their inner psychologist, hypothesizing that a real psychologist could explain the chemistry between those \"strangers\", when this could probably be better explained by a movie director. \"Two attractive and charismatic \"strangers\" kiss in a blank room, we will use a black-white filter and will edit a beautiful romantic song into the video.

And why do ppl really believe those were strangers? Well, maybe they were strangers, but that is a pretty insignificant variable for an actor or a model. Why do people think those kisses were not shot several times? Why do the people not see that, in promoting that video, they promote superficiality in our society? What message does the video convey? As it is an advertisement, the message conveyed is:\"Buy our product\". The message conveyed by the reactions to this video is basically:\"It\u00b4s so beautiful when attractive people kiss.

A few coaches came over and helped carry her off the ice, laying her on a bench, while we called the paramedics.\n\nThe skater talked a little and said she's ok, but she still looked really pale and the gash on her leg was huge and didn't stop bleeding.\n\nThe paramedics show up a few minutes later, patch her leg up, and wheel her out on a stretcher, and I'm just pacing around the whole time, with no idea what to do. Now it sounds like she has to get a ton of stitches, I might have cut through her muscle, and she'll have to stay off the ice for at least 4 weeks. And all the other skaters are afraid of skating near me on the ice!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My boyfriend changed his mind and doesn't want to use a condom anymore because he can't stay hard, but I want to use condoms. How can we fix this?\nPOST: My bf (21) and I (22) have been dating for 9 months. I recently started birth control again and spoke to to him about why I was taking it. I said that this was just a back-up method and that I wanted to keep using condoms every time we had sex. He agreed.\n\nHere are the issues we are facing:\n1. Birth control decreases my sex drive quite a bit. I have tried going on other forms of birth control (shot, other pills, patch, etc. except for implants, which I am uncomfortable with) and they all decrease my sex drive among other side effects (headaches, excessive weight gain, nausea, etc.). The pill I'm on now (Lutera) only gives me a low sex drive...thats it. Which is why I prefer it. However, have any of you found effective ways to increase sex drive while on the pill?\n2. Most of the time when he uses a condom, he has trouble staying hard? Any advice?\n3. He wants me to either go off the pill or stop using condoms. I want to use both. Condoms are not 100% effective and i have seen friends get pregnant while using them PROPERLY, including myself (got an abortion and never want to go through that again). Also, I sometimes forget to take the pill at the same time everyday. I am a full-time college students with 3 jobs so I tend to forget to take it, which is why I also use condoms.\n4. How do we find a compromise between both of our beliefs about using condoms and/or the pill?\n\nAny advice would be great!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My Boyfriend(23M) Looks Young\nPOST: I am hoping someone here has a different perspective that can help with this issue. My boyfriend Joe is 5'5\", weighs about 135lbs and just graduated from college. I think he looks perfect and has had a few girls flirt with him in the past. The problem is when he meets someone new they think he is 15 and a freshmen in high school. I actually get this a lot too but I am able to brush it off and honestly it's different when you're a woman and someone says you look young. Joe however HATES when it happens to him and gets offended. He's a very nice guy and usually just says something along the lines of \"Nope, I'm in college/just graduated and am 23. I haven't been in high school a long time.\" and leaves it at that. There are a few people who will continue to say, \"Wow! I really thought you were a freshman in high school!\" or \"No you're not! There's no way you're in college.\" At the end of the day when we talk he will bring this up and tell me how mad and powerless it makes him feel when people say things like that to him. Joe has tried dressing differently, acting differently, etc but nothing seems to stop the onslaught of almost constant comments. He seriously gets this about once a week. I've tried to reassure him and tell him how handsome he is and how maybe it'll work in his favor when he's older, or even how those people are jerks but nothing seems to help. I don't know what to do anymore to help pep him back up and I don't think he quite knows either how to deal with hearing he looks so young all the time. I think it is extra tough on him because he is just starting his career as a pilot and in that field it is very important to look the part, be in charge and be a leader. However he can't do that when people constantly think he's 15. Is there a different perspective I can give him on this matter? Are these people commenting on his looks/age just jerks? Or is this something he needs to brush off and figure out how to get over?\nTL;DR:"}

Reddit, what is your biggest \"OH SHIT\" moment doing stupid stuff as a kid?\nPOST: For those who really want to hear the story: \n\nOne night my dad pissed me off. I mean *reeeaaalllyy* pissed me off as I was and still am a pretty chill person (or so I think). Anyway, in order to hide my anger after my dad had left the room (the family room) I threw a sort of silent tantrum. You know, the type of tantrum that you know if you were loud you would get in even more trouble. So I stood there flailing my arms about and twirling in circles out of pure frustration with tears in my eyes knowing that I could do nothing about my situation. Instead of punching a pillow as any normal person would do to relieve anger mid-tantrum, I noticed my shoe on the floor and decided to pick it up. My master plan was to throw the shoe on the floor and have it hit the ground on its side so nothing would happen except for maybe a \"THUNK\" on the floor. \n\nNOPE. \n\nThe shoe flung down to the ground with the toe portion hitting the ground and it bounced up, twisted and hit right into the screen of our ONLY big screen television. Luckily, it didn't go into the TV, but it left a HUGE crack in it. \n\n\"OH FUCK,\" said my face and I silently stood there looking at the giant crack in the TV screen with my mouth wide open as the the tantrum INSTANTLY ended. \n\nMy dad screamed from downstairs, \"Sirhc7000, what just happened?!\" \n\nAs both my mom and my dad came up the stairs everything seemed to move in slow motion and their steps almost sounded like they were echoing. I knew I was fucked and I deserved whatever I had coming. Heavy breathing, chest-tightness, and a cold chill down my spine seemed to set in during this period that felt like forever. I nearly felt like I was going to pass out. Needless to say, I got in big trouble and this was probably the most anxious moment of my kid life. I remember just as clear as day.\nTL;DR:"}

We got to school and I took her on a coffee date and we had a nice conversation.  I made her laugh a lot and it went well.

We are both virgins and remaining abstinent so it didn't get completely sexual but it was passionate.  \n\nThe day after the second party i saw her and she was very stand off-ish and kind of awkward.

I handled it maturely and said thanks for being honest, but honestly I was pretty bummed out.  We talked it over a little bit.  She said she felt pressured to have feelings all at once, we jumped into things too early. I think she just got kinda scared.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I have to choose between being nearsighted or farsighted. Which would you choose and why?\nPOST: After putting in two long years at my job, I finally became eligible for health insurance. I am a 24 year old diabetic male. Some time ago, likely as a diabetic complication, my eyesight became foggy and clouded. It often looks like I'm trying to peer through a pane of glass scuffed by steel wool. As it turns out, I had developed cataracts, a large, much more intrusive one in my right eye and a less severe one in my left. The distortion is so bad that I am now functionally stereoblind and can no longer see 3D. When the day finally came to be examined and 'fitted' for surgery, I was given this strange choice to make. The reason for it is that the natural human eye lens (which is removed and replaced with a synthetic one as nature of the surgery) is flexible, and stiffens over time, which is why when you are young, you can adjust your focus, and when older, you may need bifocals to adjust from near to far vision. The synthetic lens inserted during surgery, however, is not flexible, and I am given the choice of choosing whether to be nearsighted or farsighted. I do a fair share of video gaming, on my 3DS and I have a small 3DTV, along with a fair bit of playing on my phone, tablet, and Wii U. However, driving, reading signs on the road, and not being a pain in the ass at the drive-thru are also important factors. I'm trying to weigh all the pros and cons of each situation out but this is a choice beyond comprehendible magnitude for me. They say most people opt for being farsighted, but that nearsightedness is worth consideration if you read, play games, or use the computer frequently (all too true). I have been stressing out the past few weeks about this, and still cannot come to a solid conclusion, and was hoping I could turn to some of you for a little expertise and insight to help me to sort this all out.\nTL;DR:"}

I know there was a time I really loved her, but the more I think about it, the less I think I feel that way. \n\nAll this has come to a head, because we had THAT conversation a few days ago.

The relationship has had its up and downs, but it has stabilized for the most part. \n\nHowever, there are some things that still make my boyfriend go on a ballistically angry rampage. Here are two examples of things that trigger his anger:\n\nIf I make a comment or joke about him hanging out with friends, he'll start yelling and throwing a tantrum. Note: I actually don't care when, how often, or how long my boyfriend goes and hangs out with friends -- I sincerely think it's really important to be able to juggle a relationship and friendships.

I understand that there's no point in repeatedly getting angry about the past... but I DO believe that only by discussions are we able to truly get over things that happened. \n\nSo... I guess what I'm wondering and asking is -- are these issues legitimate things to get angry about (and if so, am I supposed to just watch what I say and make sure that I don't joke around about hanging out with friends or talk about the past)?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Family Dispute\nPOST: Hey Reddit, so a friend of mine is having trouble and I need a little advice to give her, any help? The basic problem is this: Her family is trying to sell a piece of property in Idaho, but there are a few issues. First off, is her uncle. This guy, to put it simply, is a bastard. Minnie the Moocher on steroids. He is bleeding her family dry and abusing all his family ties. The problem is that on their property they were kinda enough to go in on a loan with him to build a second \"house.\" Half of it is a living space, with kitchen, etc. and the other half is a dance studio/garage. And for them to sell the place he is demanding full price for \"his house.\" Now my question is, because he is only on the loan and not on the title, can they go ahead and sell the property behind his back, pay off the loan, and kick him to the curb? Second, this house needs to sell fairly fast. It's a beautiful piece of property, 5 acres, 3000 sq ft, riverside, etc... Is there an way they can get the house off their hands, such as selling it the the back where they can get a good return without having to wait for forever for the housing market to pick up?\n\nAlso, the uncle is threatening to sue if they try to weasel their way around his \"residence\" at their place, what sort of grounds would he have for any type of lawsuit.\n\nThere is more to the story but these are the basic elements as to what the situation is.\nTL;DR:"}

The only reason I'm still holding out hope for this girl is that she dumped me because of her own problems, and we otherwise left amicably.\n\nBack story on Stefanie: she dated this guy for 5 years, all through college, culminating in a marriage that ended a few weeks later after she learned he had been lying to her about a whole bunch of things. I entered the picture a few months after the divorce.\n\nStefanie was looking for casual dating to get back on the horse, and I was the first guy she dated. Honestly, we connected too well. We went exclusive immediately, spent all our weekends and most of our evenings together, and had what was easily one of the best months of my life. \n\nThen came a weekend where she had to go out of town for a work conference, and our communication faltered when she stopped responding to my texts and didn't answer calls. She avoided me for a week until I managed to get her to have coffee with me. She told me that she was afraid she had already lost the independence she had just won back from her ex-husband after their bad 5 year relationship. She said she really cared about me but wasn't ready to be, in her words, \"defined by another person\" again. I suggested we slowed down, pull everything back a bit, but she instead cut things off completely.\n\nSo here I am now. We haven't communicated with each other in almost three weeks. I think about her everyday and want more than anything to start things up again.\n\nHow do you guys suggest I continue? I plan to give her more time at the very least, but do I try to reach out to her eventually or just wait and hope she does something first? Or is it just over? I'm reluctant to move on.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I dated for approximately 1 and a half years and after taking time to think over our relationship he decided to end it. Our break up was as amicable as possible .He said that he wanted to be friends and was extremely supportive as I was going through the grieving process.

My boyfriend of 2 years is the only person I believe knows my insecurities well, but it took me probably until a year into our relationship before I was truly open even to him. He is generally very supportive, but today I asked him if he would bring some take out over because I was tired from work etc (I do this for him sometimes) and he said something about me gaining weight recently and how he is worried I'll get fat. This concerned me as it seemed very shallow compared to being concerned about my mental health (which I assumed was priority). \n\nI couldn't really understand how he could say something like this. He basically confirmed my biggest insecurity, and on top of that I am still considered underweight. \nHe also seemed really annoyed when he said it, and said he's sick of having to look after me since I've been so depressed lately and that he wishes I at least 'pretended to be happy' sometimes. \n\nIt seems silly for me to be so upset about this but he just sounded so angry at me it's made me question our relationship a bit, and whether he still wants to be with me. It's also difficult because I really do try so hard to even get up and go to work and perform everyday tasks, I didn't think him getting us some dinner was a huge deal, and the comment about my weight really had the power to send me straight back into the level of insecurity I was at before I met him. Should I try to bring this up to him, or am I completely overreacting? \n\nSince my mental health has been bad I am constantly questioning whether my feelings are warranted or just completely irrational so some perspective would be helpful.\nTL;DR:"}

She's everything I want in a girlfriend and I couldn't be happier right now. I've never been \"good\" at dating and this is more or less my first relationship that I see getting serious with. I've been asking my friends for advice as I go and I've been mixing their advice with what I think is right in my mind (or what comes naturally). So far so good. We text/talk every day and she's been spending the past few weekends with me (Friday night and Saturday). Our schedules really don't permit much else, but we've met up during the week, too.\n\nI just have a few concerns that may or may not be anything of significance. I honestly just don't know because I haven't had a lot of relationship experience.\n\nHugging/Kissing: We always hug each other when meeting/parting. I kissed her on the second date after a hug (after a bit of an \"eye lock\" moment, as I've seen it called). On the third date, she initiated a kiss after a hug. However, since then we have only hugged. Not sure if I'm at fault or what...or if I'm paranoid for even wondering about this. When greeting/parting, should I hug and then hold her for a moment to initiate a kiss or should she be? Sorry if this sounds dumb...\n\nI guess I'm not the most affectionate person and I believe she is the same way. I just want to make sure I'm not neglecting the affection bit so she doesn't get the wrong idea. I really want to be close with her - it's just I think we're both the same way, so initiating affection feels a bit awkward. I also want to tell her that I really like her, but I'm unsure how to say it without coming off as...needy? I don't know. Does a girl usually make the decision on whether or not they're your girlfriend? Does she explicitly let you know?\nTL;DR:"}

I am currently in the process of breaking up with my boyfriend who I strongly believe has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and on top of that is an alcoholic. He is incredibly charming when he needs to be and I fall into his traps at every turn.\n\nI found out in March that he had been cheating on me for literally the entire duration of our relationship and it almost killed me, but we live together so I decided to try everything to make this work. He immediately turned on the charm and made promise after promise that this would never ever happen again and he's so sorry and he doesn't even know why it happened and I'm the only one he'll ever need. I fell hook, line, and sinker.\n\nCut to this past Sunday. I found out he's still at it. He got caught before he was actually able to go through with meeting up with this girl (he met her on tinder awhile back and they had still been talking). She found out that he had a girlfriend and messaged me to let me know what he's been up to. I decided it was time to cut ties and move out.\n\nI know that I'm making the right choice by leaving, but this feels so incredibly wrong. He is now about to start outpatient rehab treatment, which gives me hope that he can change, but the knowledge that I have of NPD drags me right back down again.\n\nI need to feel normal again. I have tons of friends who are so amazing and supportive, but I still couldn't feel more alone, as if I'm floating on a raft in the middle of the ocean with no water to drink.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with NPD or can give me some advice? Anything would be helpful right now.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [20f] with my depressed friend [18M].Can't tell if he is just an angsty teen refusing help; How do I approach him?\nPOST: Hi r/relationships! \n\nSorry if this is long, I don't know where else to go, I have no idea what to do.\n\nMy friend (we'll call him Jim) suffers from depression, but he is refusing to get help or let me help him in anyway. We'll talk on the phone for hours about how he can't get out of bed in the morning and how everyday feels pointless. He is stuck in a mindset that prevents him from healing. He legitimately hates the world and doesn't see the point in trying to make it better.\n\nI also suffer from depression, but I make a positive effort to better the world around me because even though I'm sad, it doesn't mean other people have to be. That's how I've decided to handle my illness. Even though I am trying to understand Jim's points and reasons for being depressed, it is extremely frustrating to listen to him bash the world and the people in it while he doesn't do anything to make it better. \n\nHe is also very young. At 18, I am having difficulty separating his depression from his cynical view of the world. Sometimes I think all of his \"the world is shit\" talk is just an angst-filled rant because he doesn't like the government and is \"anti-man.\" I feel horrible thinking these things, because he is definitely depressed on top of this. I am trying to understand him because I care deeply about him, but his refusal to get help is wearing on me. It is not good for my depression either. After a long conversation where he continually shut me down and refused all advice I offered, I had a massive anxiety attack because it was too overwhelming for me.\n\nSo, my question is, what do you guys think? Is he just an angst-ridden teenager, or are his reasons legitimate? I really want to help him, but he's told me \"I can't fix him.\" I know I can't, but his negativity towards getting better isn't helping him at all. Any advice on how I can approach him next? Tough love, or gentle understanding?\nTL;DR:"}

Over that time, we've had our issues and always worked them out. However, the one recurring issue we've had has been the way that I feel he communicates with me. It's about what I call, for lack of a better term, \"filtering.\"\n\nWhat I'm calling \"filtering\" is taking a split second to consider how what you're saying and how you're saying something will affect the other person, and possibly modifying how you say things and even what you say in response to that consideration. Filtering is NOT restricting yourself from getting your point across. It's not being patronizing. It's not acting like the other person is incapable of receiving something hard or hearing critique.  It's simply getting your point across in a way that is purposefully not unkind.\n\nOur recurring issue is that we seem to have a fundamental disagreement regarding filtering.\n\nHe seems to feel that if you filter in any way then you can't have real conversion. \n\nI feel that not only can real conversation be had when you filter, but that communication is more effective and that conversation is ultimately more productive when you filter your words. I also feel that purposefully not filtering is unloving and unkind, regardless of how long you've known that person.\n\nWe had a blowup about this tonight, and it got so bad that I ended up kicking him out, which I've never done. I'm not sure if the relationship is over.\n\nI realize that sometimes people need to vent, and that's ok. And I also realize that mistakes will be made during communication.  But for the most part, is it unreasonable to expect communication from your partner that takes how you feel into account?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [MA] Should Magic the Gathering Events have sales tax?\nPOST: For those of you unfamiliar with Magic the Gathering it is a playing/trading card game that has been around for about 20 years.  There are many stores that hold events for people who enjoy playing the game to participate in.  Some of these events participants pay a fee to play the game with decks that they bring themselves.  If they win they normally receive packs of cards or store credit to buy more cards.  Another format of playing is called a draft where a player pays to enter and then is given three packs of cards to create a deck from and play only with the cards they are given.  Once again if they win they will receive packs of cards or store credit to buy more cards.  My research has shown that what they win is counted as income and I do not need to worry about that however I have been unable to find if these events should be charging sales tax for the entry fee.  The closest information I can find is either for non-profits (which does not apply) or in gambling laws (which also do not apply).  I have met store owners who do charge sales tax as well as store owners who do not and no one is quite sure of the correct answer.  I would love if someone could help clarify this for me.

We've been a couple for around 3 months now and had been dating for a couple of months prior to that. We both understand that it is still very early days but both care about each other immensely and want this to work out for the long term. It's probably important to note that we're each others first serious relationship so are both still learning how to be in a relationship etc. \n\nAt the moment we see each other around 3 times a week, we both have our own social lives, we both work and she goes to University. So whilst we are in a committed relationship we get that sense of freedom and our own personal time to do what we want, which I think is important.\n\nNow this leads me on to my question, in a couple of weeks she is going clubbing with a few of her friends. I guess it's worth saying that all of her friends have long term boyfriends as well. I do trust her completely but I also understand what these places are like and what the people are like inside the clubs.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is if it's ok for me just to talk to her before she goes and just explain that I do trust her, but that doesn't mean I won't worry and that I hope she has a good time but just to be careful. I worry about this as it may make her feel guilty for going or something like that. Or maybe it's just none of my business at all?\n\nReally this isn't about me wanting to stop her going, but I'm just interested to see what other couple do in terms of clubbing and how you feel about your SO doing it because it's not a situation I've been in before.\nTL;DR:"}

The first time I smelled (cigarette) smoke, I was in my room with the door closed. I opened it, walked into the living room, and she and 4 of her friends were sitting there smoking. I said \"Can you guys stop smoking?\" One of them said sorry and appeared to put it out. I looked at her and she said \"yeah...\" after a pause. They then went into her room, and she came out 2 minutes later and said \"Sorry about that.\" The smell went away after about 30 minutes with all the windows open. I hoped that was going to be it.\n\nThe next 2 weeks, nothing. Then, tonight, I smell it in my room again. She's opened one window in the entire apartment, and probably doesn't even have the one in her room open because it's cold. I'm not really sure how to approach this. I know the landlord, who also manages the property, but I don't really want to talk to him about this unless I really have to do so. She might not be planning to live here long-term so even if eviction were likely, it might not be much of a threat. I don't really think my feelings about smoking in the apartment are unclear, I'm sure I looked pretty pissed when I asked her friends to stop smoking.

I know that each experience is going to be different, but I'm really just looking for any examples that others might have of people having similar experiences and still staying with their SO. What was the relationship like before/after? Was the veil of that incident always hanging over the heads of those in the relationship?

This whole post has the potential to make me sound horrible, but I'm just trying to be honest. \n\nAcademically, I am smarter than him. I don't think he is stupid by any means - he knows way more about loads of stuff than I do. But in terms of academic intelligence, he's not the best. This is fine by me - I love him and I think he is wonderful just the way he is. \n\nHowever, it's not necessarily something I'm used to. Sometimes, he'll say/write something that's grammatically incorrect. Or he'll be talking about a topic and say something completely factually wrong - typically I can't think of an example whilst I'm trying to write this, but it would be something like getting the capital of a country completely wrong. The thing is, he definitely has a hang up about being \"stupid\" and it's something he's mentioned before. But if a friend from university did the same thing, I'd correct them - not in a mean way, just like \"oh, I think you meant xxx\" I'm just concerned that doing the same thing with him will make him feel stupid - which he isn't. I'm not saying I'm perfect or anything either, I get stuff wrong all the time and my grammar is hardly perfect - but I don't mind when people correct me. \n\nI feel like I'm probably worrying over nothing, but I know the \"intelligence\" thing is an issue of him. I recently got my final grades from university and the same day that I told him he mentioned feeling stupid so I know I need to be careful.

She always invites me over and we will just talk and hang out. We both seem to be into each other on some level, but nothing has yet happened romantically. \n\nFast forward to last night. I threw a party at my apartment and she came over toward the end. She said that she was quite drunk and wanted to stay the night. I tell her no problem and she goes and gets into my bed. Since we hadn't even kissed at this point, I just assume that she genuinely needed a place to stay and wasn't looking for anything more than that. So I turn off the light and tell her goodnight while I go and tend to the people still left at my party. \n\nA little bit later, I come back into the room and have to turn on the light to put some speakers and things back on my desk. She is just laying in the bed kind of half awake. At this point, my male friend goes into my bathroom, which is located in my room about 5 feet from the bed, and starts puking up a storm from having drank so much. All this noise and light makes it so she is awake again and we are just kind of hanging out, with her in bed and me sitting at my desk. Eventually, my male friend passes out in the bathroom and she is laying in the bed. I decide to turn off the light and fall asleep on the bedroom floor. \n\nI'm wondering if I have messed up here by not making a move by going to bed with her in the first place, before my other friend passes out in the same room. I actually am interested in her, and am now realizing how blatantly she was trying to make a move and that I kind of rejected it. I'm not sure how to proceed from this point and wonder if she will just move on. Is it appropriate to verbally bring this up with her. Should I do something for her to show that I am attracted? I'm pretty damn naive when it comes to relationships. Help!\nTL;DR:"}

What Can I Do?\nPOST: I have a 2 year old labradoodle that is generally a well behaved dog and really fun.\n\nHe's been more of a challenge than I expected in a few ways. I suspect he has a bit of separation anxiety or something as you could probably describe him as a \"velcro dog\". He follows either my wife or I around constantly and is never satisfied to just sit and chew a bone in a room. In the warmer month if we're working in the yard with him tied up in the back yard and we move out of his line of sight he barks like crazy.\n\nThe hardest thing for me to deal with is that he eliminates in the house during the day. With everything we've tried he's usually an angel for about 2 weeks and then it's like he stops trying. Every day when we come home there's pee in one place and poop in another. This happened with his crate and so we tried letting him have a portion of our house with plenty to keep him busy during the day. He was good for a little over a month\u2014no accidents\u2014and now suddenly it's like he's given up again. I suspect it's a separation anxiety thing but I'm not sure. He never has accidents in the house when there are people home.\n\nI have no idea how to approach this. We spend a lot of time with him, he's given lot's of exercise, toys, good food. I guess I'm just frustrated that we keep finding new routines that work for him and then he just stops \"trying\". \n\nThanks in advance for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

This is a really weird situation and I need help figuring out what to do.\n\nI met this guy on Craigslist, and we started chatting on Kik.  It was supposed to be a strictly platonic thing, but he started sending me really sexual stuff - dick picks, his naked wife, videos of them having sex, etc.  I told him several times I did NOT want to receive that stuff, but he continued to send it.  I would have just blocked him and moved on, but what really freaks me out is that he's a high school teacher and interspersed with all this sexual stuff were pictures and videos of his students that were clearly taken without their knowledge.  Occasionally he'd caption them with seemingly harmless remarks like \"8/10\", but given all the other pornographic stuff he was sending me I found it all really disconcerting.\n\nI feel like I should report this to someone but I don't know how.

Is she losing interest?\nPOST: Backstory: I started seeing this girl about four months ago, we work together (I know big mistake right). I knew at this point she didn't want a proper relationship (even though that's pretty much how we ended up). For the first few months she was always really affectionate, pretty clingy, would always spend time with me and pretty much just never leave me alone. We were having a great time together, but suddenly she said she wanted us to just be friends because she wanted to be alone.\n\nI refused to be her friend but then obviously we work together so we had to see eachother anyway. She literally would not leave me alone, constant messaging, trying to convince me to meet up with her, etc. She eventually managed to get me alone at work and we pretty much couldn't resist eachother, and suddenly we're back seeing eachother again.\n\nSo fast forward a month to now, we're still seeing eachother. We were at a big work barbecue, nearly all of us are there. For the whole day she hardly paid me any attention, spent most of her time with another guy, didn't even give me a hug or anything. I asked her to help me do the button up on my sleeve and she pushed my arm away. Someone asked to take a picture of us and she said no. I was obviously annoyed by this, and when I told her what was wrong she got annoyed and walked off.\n\nAfter talking to her and telling her it feels like she's not interested because of this and her just showing less interest in general, she tells me that she is and would tell me if she's not. She said she's got comfortable with me, and when she does, she shows much less affection. I don't like this.\n\nAm I overreacting from this? Was I right to be annoyed? At the moment we're still together but I don't know whether to finish it because I just don't really feel wanted. And the fact that she tried so hard to get me back a month ago then stopped showing interest when she got me just makes me feel like she only wants me when she can't have me.\nTL;DR:"}

And then there are other people who I guess I just don't have that kind of chemistry with, and who I'd rather just talk to every other day or so.

However today, he did not initiate contact, and neither did I.\n\nI feel that whenever we do text, it is always about my day, and when I try to turn the attention to what is going on with him and his life, he closes up or changes the subject.  I find this to also be true when we talk in person. Now I am starting to wonder if we don't have enough chemistry or if he's boring, because he seems to never have much to say about himself and I am starting to feel obligated to speak with him at some point during the day. When I have an uneventful day (like today), I feel weird texting him because I know he will only want to talk about my day, when in fact my day was uneventful and boring, and I fear that there won't really be much to say.  \n\nMy question is: Is it normal to go a day without contacting someone you have been dating for a month?

So now neither of us is drunk but I have to drive home.\n\nThis has come up again with a party coming up. She says she wants me to drive. I know it will turn into both of us being completely sober.

Honestly I have no problem with driving her, I just don't feel like limiting myself the few times I actually get to go out if she isn't going to drink anyway.\n\nI know it's silly but her refusal to drink kind of bugs me.

Our lives have taken two drastically different paths and she seems to despise me for it. I do very well in school and have a good future planned out for myself, but I never throw it in her face or try to make her feel bad. The problem here is that I want to have a relationship with her, but she makes that almost impossible since she has reached the point where she hates every positive thing I achieve.

A couple months ago, my car died. I have always wanted a Jeep Wrangler, and I finally took the plunge and bought myself one. She is beautiful. I absolutely love her. \n\nToday, I decided to be a nice and helpful girlfriend. I have lots of leftover paint from painting my house and decided to take a couple cans over to my boyfriend's house and paint some rooms. We are trying to get his house listed for sale and I figured this would increase the value of the house. I took all the cans and loaded them up carefully in the back of my Jeep. They were all closed (or so I thought).\n\nI drove over to my boyfriends house. For those of you that are unfamiliar, driving a Jeep is like driving a tank. It's a little bit of a bumpy ride. I hopped out and walked around back to unload the paint cans and as soon as I opened the door, paint poured out of the back hatch and went everywhere. One of the cans had tipped over in transport, and apparently was not closed like I thought it was. \n\nIt took a few hours and cutting the carpet out of the back of the car to get it all out. Bonus picture of the damage at the bottom of the post!\nTL;DR:"}

He's not someone I would go for, but he seemed really nice and we talked a lot for hours and hours and it was really fun. I told him more than once that I'm not into him and this won't change, but somehow I gave him my number (please don't ask me why, I was drunk as hell). \n\nSo yeah, he messaged me a few days later that he had a lot of fun and wants to meet me again. After some messaging I said we could meet again \"as friends\". \n\nA week later the plans got more exact and what he had in mind was really .... like a date kind of thing. So I was torn and said that this is too much and that I think he expects too much from this meeting \"as friends\" and that I don't think this is a good idea. This upset him and all I got back was a short answer that ended the whole thing.\n\nI feel so bad about this somehow. On one hand I feel it's wrong to meet him again when he clearly doesn't just want to be friends with me because it will get his hopes up, on the other hand I really liked him and hate myself for not giving him a chance because I'm not attracted to him at all.\n\nSo I don't know what I want to ask you guys, do you think something like the attraction could change? Or should I go with my first instinct and leave him alone.\nTL;DR:"}

We had our differences on philosophical and some political views which didn't bother me before, but as things grew I became annoyed by them.

She was very clear with him that she wants me as a life partner, despite having feelings for him, and that they could talk as friends but she didn't want to discuss any more than that, because it wasn't fair to me to even be talking about things like that.\n\nI love her. I had planned to marry her. We have a big apartment together, we work well together, we have a wide variety of exotic pets, and I'm not ready to give up on this yet, unless I'm told that doing so would make me a dumb shit. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.

My daughter is over a year old now, though, and has only seen her grandmother a handful of times. We've tried to just give her exposure to show her that really her granddaughter isn't all that different from a normal kid her age, but she still seems very uninterested in engaging with our daughter.

He gambles all his money away and puts it back in the bar.

There have been times where he has rang the door bell late at night just to ding dong ditch his kid with us so he could go gamble. \n\nAll of this shit hit the fan friday after I called my mom; my uncle got in a fight with my mother, his brother, and cried the whole night at my house about his problems. This was a result of my other uncle telling timmy \" I hope you don't end up like your father when he grows up. Jerry flipped shit and went after my other uncle, who promptly threw him in a head lock and told him to leave. The worst, though, was realizing that my little cousin cried the whole way to my house after witnessing his dad and uncle fight. He screamed at his father \"You never do anything with me!!!

I accidentally clicked out of a page I wanted to use, so I thought - hey! That's what the history is for. So I went to the internet history and found my article. \n\nHOWEVER, in the same page of history I saw a name I recognized - my Boyfriend's ex. It was Facebook history and said \"Her name - messages\", which I assumed meant private messaging. They stopped dating 2 yrs ago but were together for 3. It wouldn't have bothered me except he has adamantly assured me time and time again they don't talk. \n\nHere's where I did something bad - I clicked into his Facebook page to see what they had been talking about... But all the Facebook history of messaging had been deleted up to a year prior. Now I was REALLY confused. And hurt. So I looked further into his Internet history and found LOTS of history on her messages, though he had deleted her correspondence. \n\nI'm lost and hurt. I'm not proud of myself for snooping, but now I know my boyfriend is trying to hide something from me.\nTL;DR:"}

How important is the ceremony, really?\nPOST: A little background: I lived with my aunt, uncle, and nephew for a year when I moved to the area 6 years ago. My uncle and I never really went to church with my aunt and nephew. I went for his first communion only because I happened to be living with them at the time, and I've taken him to church when my aunt was out of town as a favor to her. She's very accepting of this, obviously, since her husband is Christian but thinks religion should be private so he doesn't attend a church either.\n\nI recently got an invite to my nephew's confirmation ceremony with a dinner to follow, but I think that if I don't really support the whole thing, I shouldn't go. I believe that my nephew hasn't had much of a choice in his religion, as my aunt made it very clear that his attendance was mandatory until very recently. The whole \"confirming you are a soldier in the Catholic army\" thing rubs me the wrong way, too. My nephew has never spoken about his religion in front of me, so it must not be that important to him, right? And that means I don't have to go?\n\nI'd go to church with them for a wedding or funeral, as these are really important life events. Is Catholic confirmation up there in importance?\nTL;DR:"}

Lately though I've noticed that I miss having someone i can trust and put my trust in, but im not somebody to jump into throwaway relationships just because im lonely. About a year ago, i met a girl through university rock climbing club that i help head, and we got along but were nothing more than acquaintances. She stopped climbing for a long while though,returned this semester, and we've gotten much closer.\n       We got to be better friends because i was her ride for a 6 hour drive up to a climbing crag along with another friend of ours, and thats when things started to kick off. Since then weve done a lot of trips together for rafting, climbing, music festivals, that sort of thing, (with another female friend of ours) and she seems like somebody that would be a lot of fun to date. I know that she has some little crushes and former flings who live in different cities from her raft guide job last summer, but they just seem like the same sort of thing everyone has.\n      Basically, Im wondering if it seems like she may have some feelings for me as well (i can answer questions about her in comments or messages) and how/if i should ask her out. My main concern isn't even really that she'll say no, its that if she does, she'll feel too awkward to continue to hand out with me, because even if we don't date i really enjoy hanging out with her on our trips. Any advice or insight is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

The last 2 relationships lasted roughly 2 years each. I had 3 month breaks between each of them, so I like to think I'm not just a relationship hopper. \n\nWhat I'm worried about is that in this third relationship the adrenaline and rush has worn off more quickly than the first two. The whole lovey-dovey feeling has plateaued quickly. We've been dating about 3 months. I'm worried that there might not be anything special to look forward to with any relationship. It seems that nothing will ever be as special as that first relationship or the first time I went on a date to x place.\n\nIs it something wrong with the guy or with my outlook?

I was ravenous for him and now I'm just meh. I'll explain. \n\nHe got a new job and had to shave his facial hair, which makes him look compleeetely different, but I understand it's not his fault so I deal with it. Then he got new glasses and holy cow, they're so thick that they make him look like an owl. They magnify his eyes and make them look 4x bigger. I'm so sorry to say this and I realize that I'll get a lot of hate for this but....his skinny frame combined with his thick glasses and lack of facial hair....He looks totally different.  I've started being really active and working out/counting calories, which has really helped me get into shape. I'm 5'0 and 110 lbs, and I've finally started to tone. Anyway! This has made me want him to gain weight and become muscular, atleast a little bit.

We were our each other's firsts for everything and I really do love her. We live very close to each other which helps our relationship function a lot easier. \n\nThe story is, we went to a party together last night and had a good time with all our friends. However, as we were about to leave, I went to fetch her and saw her on the trampoline looking up, and my friend's (17M) arm around her.\n\nNormally I wouldn't arise suspicion but this friend, let's call him P, has been extensively talking to my girlfriend for the past few months. They have gotten really close really quickly and I was initially anxious about that but I came to terms with it. They were, as she would put it, just good friends.\n\nSo last night on the trampoline, after I came over, and P left, I told her 'I'm not comfortable with how close you're getting with P.' My thought was just to set the boundaries and how I found that behaviour unacceptable. She got very upset at this and continued to be the whole car trip home. \n\nI'm not sure what is going to happen now, but I did tell her I wanted to discuss this in depth like adults. Today, even though it's Valentine's Day she wanted some space to think about things and other bothers of hers, and I'm respecting that wish.

My ex-girlfriend had some good male friends that she met very often. I thought that it was all good and that they were just nice guys, until every single one of them confessed their love to her, started hitting on her and talked shit about me behind my back. Although it didn't affect our relationship, it was rather sad for her because she found it to awkward to hang around with them after that.\n\nNow, this girl that I'm currently dating also has couple of single male friends that she meets a lot. Some of them have been friends with her for couple of years, but some of them she just met couple of months ago.\n\nI've never met anyone of them and I don't know how they're around each other. But for example, yesterday she went to movies with one of them and told me she crashed on the couch. The other day she went to the beach with two guys and when we met the day after, one of them was constantly sending her text messages.\n\nAnd today I asked her if she wanted to eat something with me, but she already had dinner plans with a friend.\n\nCan female and male friendships work? Should I be concerned or am I just being jealous?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My roommate abuses his puppy horribly.  What should I do Reddit?\nPOST: This semester i roomed randomly with two other guys, who i would say are mostly cool guys.  Less than two months ago, one of them got a pit puppy and has been progressively getting more violent towards the little guy.  Don't get me wrong, I respect my roommate, he is usually a cool guy to chill with. Yet he is just a deeply, deeply troubled man who very much likes to beat, kick, and starve his dog to deal with his own demons.  The first month or so I was a little concerned, but was simply under the impression that he was raised similarly, through physical discipline.  But the recent weeks concerned me the most, and where I found him when i awoke today was the last straw for me, I can remain silent no longer.  When my roomy is away, he tends to lock his puppy in his room usually without food or water.  This time, i found him not in a room, but locked in a drawer, barely big enough for the puppy to breathe.  When i released him he downed like 3 bowls of water and much food; the little guy was starving and shaking like a former crack addict.  \n\nSo, i ask, what can I do about this?  I really like my roommate and I know he does it to sublimate his own stress; but his abuse is absolutely ludicrous, it needs to stop.  What are dogs rights in this situation?  Is there anyway i could deal with this without him knowing it was me?  Or would it be best to let him know what i think, no matter how it hurts our roommate relationship?  My other roommate may also feel the same, would it help to team up on his to help him realize what he is doing is wrong?\nTL;DR:"}

Dates are great and it's always a great time and I have to say I really really like this girl.\n\nAs we do some time skips to the present, Colbee's response to my texts have gotten less responsive to the point where I have to send about 3-4 to be answered or outright ignored.  Dates are still fun and we usually end up having a nice snuggle session the problem with that being whenever we are hanging out at my place or on an actual date anytime she gets a text or call she immediately replies or answers, she even steps out of theaters or worms out of a snuggle to do this.\n\nI guess the question I need/want answered is, is that normal behavior for some couples and I'm just freaking cause I'm experiencing it for the first time? Is this an issue in communication that needs to be hashed out, or if it looks like she has lost interest in me?\nTL;DR:"}

We went ahead and set up a date for the next day. Just a small date where we spent walking around downtown and sight seeing all her favorite places. I enjoyed every second of it and I could tell she did too. At the end of the day, I told her how much I enjoyed spending time with her and she said she did too. Before I left dropped her at her place, I had to tell her I was only here for a week and had to leave for school in a couple days. I could see she was saddened by it. I kissed her and dropped her off. Now I am laying in my bed wondering what I should do. It's funny how even though I only spent a day with her, I have never felt like that with any other girl. Don't want to sound like a dick but usually girls at parties or some attractive girls I know, I am only attracted to them sexually and nothing more but she was different. I don't know what I should do. I am afraid I might lose her if I don't make a move right now but I don't know if I should ask her to be my girlfriend since we have only been on one date and won't see each other until summer break. I don't know what to do. Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for a long time now and really haven't had any relationship problems even now. I guess I just wanted some commentary/advice on how to nurture this.\n\nIt started the summer before my junior year and her freshman year. Long story short: we worked at the same place, a temporary summer job. I rigged a bunch of shifts to be with her after the first one (stalkerish, I know). Eventually I asked her out and she said yes. I know what a lot of people may think up until this point: 2 years older may be too much, it may not last, etc.\n\nFast forward about 3 years, here we are, with her about to enter her senior year and me about to go to my sophomore year of college. We live in the same city btw and I go to a college in the same city. \n\nIn the past year I became a little bit more needy than usual and I expressed this to her. She told me she understood how I felt and that she honestly was giving me all the time she coyld. She has an extraordinarily busy schedule. \n\nWe ended up resolving that problem because we agreed that our happiness was not contingent on the presence of the other at all times. We agreed that we would find ways to be happy even when the other wasn't around. This helped immensely. We're still going strong.\n\nNow, here comes stuff we've been talking about. \n\nPreface: we have gone no further than 3rd base and thus have never had sex. We talk about it a lot though. She has expressed repeatedly that she refuses to even consider it at least until she graduates.\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking here is....what now? Where should I go from here? How do I help nurture a relationship like this? Feel free to ask any questions. You won't offend me with any questions at all. The only advice I will ignore is to break up, because I see no need for it.\n\nThanks for reading!\nTL;DR:"}

He said he would go through with it because he loves me and he wants me to be happy but he doesn't really understand why I would want that.

My wife told me there is nothing stopping him from having fun with the door open and down here.  \n\nThey are still ridiculous, he is not allowed to have her over if there is no adult supervision, he can't close his door, he needs to text them and tell them where he is. He is not allowed to go to her house if her parents are not home. My brother and I think they are cock blocking the poor kid. His sisters are putting restrictions on his relationship and that is not fair \n\nHow can I get them to see they are being unreasonable\nTL;DR:"}

He's the man of my dreams, but Im not sure I can do the distance. What to do?\nPOST: My bf and I met at work almost a year ago, he was part time and I was full time so we were friendly acquaintances at best for a while. January comes around and he's working more frequently and I see him more often, we click instantly. And after a few weeks and bit of a rocky start, we became official. We like the same things, we have the same interests, we have the same friends, I even joke that I'm with him just to hear my own opinion in a manlier voice. Its like were in perfect sync all the time, like we were meant to be the same person. We did everything together, and were that gross overly-affectionate couple everyone hates. He's a wizard in the sack. What I mean to get at is, our relationship was perfect and I couldn't ask for anything better.  \n\nThe problem happened when I lost my job and moved back to finish college. I couldn't finish school where we were cause I wasn't a resident of that state and I can't afford out of state tuition. He's also in college and can't transfer to my state for the same reason. So now we live 12 hours away in different states, both in college and working. Its been a month since we parted ways and every day apart grates me more and more. He's been nothing but incredibly supportive, showering me in love and promises to wait for me. But despite doing everything right, I'm completely miserable. I'm losing faith in us, I'm losing the passion and love that I have for him. Im sure that the problem is the distance, there's literally no other problem in our relationship. I don't want to fall out of love with him or leave the relationship for something that seems so fixable, but its only been a month and Im quickly realizing that distance is just not something I can deal with. He's suggested that he drop school to move up to me, but that's just not something Im selfish enough to agree to. Im at the end of my rope, Reddit, what are my options?\nTL;DR:"}

(21,F). (Louisiana to Portland, OR). I love it here! \nI started a job at a restaurant and since I've begun there I was immediately attracted to the line cook in the back kitchen. He's not like any one I've ever met and he truly intrigues me. Hes handsome and cool and artsy and.. Well you know. The thing is at first I thought he liked my co worker- friend but actually now I don't think he does. She's been working there for a few months longer than me and he and I have already gotten closer than he and her have in only a few weeks. \nHe is always inviting me to go somewhere with him during our work break when we work together and we usually go to sit by the waterside and smoke cigs and listen to music and talk. (Our breaks are about 3 hrs long). We will sit there and talk for the entire time and the last time we did he commented \"wow time goes by so fast here when you come with me\". Maybe I'm just being over zealous, but does that mean something? \nHowever, when I ask him to come out with me after work for drinks or something he says he wants to but he's always too tired. He also has another job so I do try to be understanding about this. \nHe remembers EVERYTHING I tell him, about my life, about my music preferences, my car, my style, my thoughts and feelings. He's very thoughtful to me. He defends me when someone says something about me bad at work. (I know it's true because my friend told me she overheard him.) he doesn't text me though, unless I text him first and idk if he's someone who usually takes things at a slow pace or not? Maybe I'm just being crazy.\nTL;DR:"}

I was so excited. I hadn't traveled or seen my brother in a while. We called travelocity the other day and had them clear up an issue with my passport, which expires in several months and for those who don't know, the EU now has laws against traveling with a passport that expires within 6 months, which mine does.\n\nSo we get to the airport today and get told that apparently the airline cannot do anything against EU laws, and travelocity talked to the wrong one about the issue, giving us the wrong information.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [22F] partner [23M] tells me depression and anxiety are not real\nPOST: I have suffered from invalidated and predominantly unmedicated depression and anxiety for over half my life. Partner comes along and after years of hard work manages to make me realise I'm worthy of love, especially my own. He was the only one who has ever been able to support me emotionally while I worked on improving my mental health, and has been there for me on a personal level for about a decade.\n\nIn the past few years of our relationship (well past any 'honeymoon phase') we have had constructive conversations about my mental health, where it has been very clear he believed my feelings were legitimate and serious. But in the past year or so it has been a no-go topic for both of us, because every time the topic comes up, I am reduced to tears with no consolation. He thinks that I'm just being a baby, but really I feel upset that he has given up on me. He is pissed off that we fought, and I am left feeling incredibly alone. \n\nWhat I can gather is that he seems to think that if there isn't a large concrete event that the emotions can be tied to, they can easily be overcome. He also takes self harm seriously, but I have never done any physical self harm,  however I do inflict insane amounts of mental self harm on myself. \n\nIt feels incredibly invalidating for me to be told, by the person I care most about, that how I feel is not real, is not worthy of attention, that I am a weak, lazy and attention seeking child. I think that his change of tone is due to him feeling that I'm not worth the effort anymore. This is obviously heartbreaking and not at all healthy in a relationship. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or good depression or anxiety analogies, comics or graphics, please do share - maybe its my style of explaining that is making it hard for him to understand right now. \n\nIf it is him distancing himself emotionally then this will not get better if I don't get better either, so if you have any strategies for me to add to things I'm trying I would greatly appreciate it.\nTL;DR:"}

Now her mother has purchased a week long trip for her and her sister to....you guessed it...Mexico. Five months after the last vacation.

After a while I saw his 'true self'. Out of no where he would pick on my boyfriend for any little thing at work. Not only did my bf mention about this to me but other coworkers told me about it also. If my boyfriend did not listen to Guy X, he would go tell the manager. My bf is not afraid so whenever Guy X would tell him something to do or say he was doing something wrong, my bf would just reply saying \"no\" \"go tell the manager, I don't care\" or just ignore him.

I must add here that I'm not a big fan of football and haven't played in years.\n\nAll was going well until I decided to show off my non-existent football skills.  I ended up slipping off the ball and falling on my elbow.  Hard.\n\nAt first I thought it was nothing, but as time went by the pain got worse and I could barely move my elbow.  Nevertheless, I brushed it off and went on with my day. \n\nI got home at 9:30pm (by bus) and at this point I could barely move my arm.  My parents got worried and drove me to the local health centre. (And this time, by local I mean a 10 minute drive)  The doctor there told me that it's probably pulled muscles, and that it would get better in a week or two, but advised that I get an X-ray just in case.  For that, we had to go to yet another health centre because no radiographers were present.  Fuck my life.\n\nSo we got to the 2nd health centre after a further 15 minute drive.  The X-ray was done and it was concluded that I have a radial head fracture (type 1), which basically means that a part of my elbow bone broke but was still in place, meaning that it would get better if my arm is plastered for 6 weeks.  But, of course, no orthopaedic specialist was there so I was sent to a hospital (a further 15 minute drive) and got it plastered there.\n\nSo basically playing football led to me fracturing my elbow and getting my dominant arm plastered for 6 weeks.  Gonna be an annoying 6 weeks.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: The mental aspect of working out while loosing weight.\nPOST: I'm just curious what others think about this.  I've seen people on here who have lost weight thru diet alone (thumbs up to them) and I've become pretty convinced that calories in < calories out is the best and most basic principal when it comes to loosing weight.\n\nFor my personal weight loss I've developed a healthy lifestyle sort of goal and one that I can live comfortably with and maintain.  I concentrate on calories using myfitnesspal which allows me to count my calories without having to think about it too much.\n\nI do go to the gym or workout 4-6 times a week and try to get in walks whenever possible as well (this can range form 1/2 hour to 2 hours and sometimes I don't get out at all, or I might get 2 or 3 in during the week, although not often).  I push myself really hard at the gym doing 1/2 hour cardio and 1/2 hour strength training although I'm probably going to up the strength training to 45 min to an hour.\n\nOne thing I've noticed about myself though is that when I workout I am more motivated and encouraged to eat better.  For me it's kind of an all or nothing sort of deal.  It seems that if I'm not doing one, I don't feel compelled to do the other.  So even though I'm making sure my diet is my main form of weight loss (I don't eat over my calories for the day and the exercise just becomes 'bonus' calories lost) I find the active lifestyle and workouts are just as important to me mentally.\n\nI think part of this stems from the fact that by being stronger, faster, having more stamina, and more energy it makes day to day life better and this emphasis and magnifies the benefits of the weight loss which primarily comes from the food.\n\nThoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been having a few issues dating and I'd really appreciate any advice anyone has.\n\nGuys rarely seem to think of me as girlfriend material and I'm not sure why. I get told a lot that I'm attractive and funny and fun to be around, but a lot of the time a guy will start messaging me and then it will just fizzle out after a couple weeks.\n\nI'm an obsessive person by nature. Once I like something I usually love it. If I try a new hobby and like it, I'll spend all my time doing it, spend money on all the equipment, talk about it a lot. I'll see one episode of a show and binge 6 seasons in a week. I'll forget to eat for two days if I'm in the middle of a work project. Things like that.\n\nI do this with guys too, but obviously I know to restrain myself. Once I start messaging them I find it hard to think about other things, particularly anyone else. My friends always laugh about my intense crushes, however brief they are.\n\nI'm an all or nothing girl and I tend to get frustrated if a guy is not as into me and I am them (which usually happens). I don't like playing games (waiting days to reply to a message, making people jealous etc) but sometimes I wonder if that's what I should start doing? Because messaging normally (eg when I see they've text I just reply then) seems to put guys off?\n\nAny questions are welcome because I don't get what I'm doing wrong. I'll be texting a guy and it'll seem great and we'll plan to meet up but then it just fizzles out before the date.\nTL;DR:"}

We have an awesome relationship and are very close, we've gotten way better at communicating and don't fight often. When we do, our fights are just discussions/arguments, not fights involving name-calling, yelling, etc. Welp... the past few times we've argued it's been because we're both stressed or had a dumb misunderstanding. However, these bring up negative feeling because I can't get over a BIG fight we had about a year ago. We had agreed on something, but he let a manipulative asshole \"friend\" change his mind about it and broke my trust multiple times (made a mistake, said sorry, did it AGAIN). I can't help feeling resentment about it and it's really hard to let it go. I'm a pretty reasonable, low-maintenance girlfriend compared to some people I know and I asked him not to do ONE thing and he broke my trust. \nSo my question is: Am I just holding a grudge for no reason or is it justified?  How do I get past this and trust him/not feel so bad about it?

She used to 'grope' me at work and let me know how much she loved/wanted me, and now i can hardly get her to acknowledge that I love her.\n\nShe explains it by saying it helps her by creating the distance that will help make it easier for her to leave me. She insists she still cares and still loves me (when we have talked about it) but also insists that I will be unhappy with her as it will be a long term relationship.\n\nFor the first time, i feel like i could spend the rest of my life with this woman but it seems like she just could care less.\n\nI feel like some of it might spring from my reluctance to move forward with a woman who has a child.

I have suggested that we try more dates with just the two of us + I'll try to show more affection when people I know are not around - but what else can I do? \n\nI just don't know what can be done, are we just too different to actually work out? Should we take a break until we can move in together?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by trying to get lunch at my gf's work.\nPOST: So for context, my girlfriend and I rent a room from her sister in her home  recently her sister has put her house on the market and there are regular viewings over the weekends. As well, my girlfriend and I have a small amount of time to save money, find a place, and move. So needless to say I'm stressed, and I can't even spend my weekend playing games and relaxing, so I'm frustrated. \nSo during todays viewing I decide to go visit my girlfriend at the subway she works at (also the subway I worked at, and recently quit for a better job). When I get in my girlfriend is sweeping up the lobby ad I decide to sit down and wait for her to be finished before I order. This is when my asshole of a former employer walks in. This guys does not like me. He immediately begins to tell me I'm distracting his workers and that I need to leave. When I say that I just wanted a sandwich, he tells me he doesn't need my business, tells me again to leave and not come back. So I leave and on the way out just call human asshole. \nWhile sitting outside killing time to go home I notice that he's been in there for a while. And I'm beginning to worry he is going to punish my girlfriend or even fire her for my conduct. I've texted her but have received no reply. I'm sitting in the bar across the street right now waiting. If I got her fired only months before we need to move I am definitely fucked. I'm praying that I'm underestimating how much of an asshole my boss is.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: SV: I've lost more weight than I thought I had!\nPOST: I weigh in weekly and take body measurements once a month. I started seriously counting calories and committing to regular exercise in December, exactly three months ago. My mom asked me if I was insane to start calorie counting right before Christmas!\n\nI kind of fudged my starting weight on MFP from previous years when I'd used it and quit, so today, after a couple weeks of bouncing around, I found I was down another pound (losing at a rate of roughly 1 pound per week, I don't measure in-betweens). MFP was displaying that I'd lost 9 pounds, but when I went back to my handwritten log, I've actually lost 12 pounds since I started tracking! It was such a good feeling to know that my hard work is paying off. \n\nSo to any of you feeling bummed out about fluctuations or having a bad day, week, month, whatever - don't give up! I am still not happy with my body as my progress is pretty slow, but I am happy with the changes I am making! I can tell I am gaining muscle strength from the weight training I do; I can even see slight definition even though I still have plenty of body fat to lose. My stamina and endurance for all things has improved greatly, even for gentle exercise like walking and yoga. The best thing about progress is that I don't deprive myself. I have a huge sweet tooth and have managed to fit small treats into my every day caloric budget! Losing weight is not about eating steamed vegetables and fish all day every day.\nTL;DR:"}

We spend a lot of time together and love each other. In the 8 months we have been dating (we have known each other for about 2 years) we haven't had any real problems or conflict. We met each other in a job that we both are still in right now (and I plan on staying in for a while.) \n\nSo the problem is he is going to college and we both realize it might be hard to sustain a relationship while he is gone. He is living on campus which is two hours away from where we live (We live in the same town, we don't live together.) He only be able to visit every month or so which will be hard for me. I'm not trying to be clingy and protective but I can't handle the thought of that and him possible cheating on me. I trust him and we have talked about it but I'm scared of an \"in the moment\" decision. \n\nHe realizes this is a problem for our relationship as well but believes we can work it out. We have talked about different options and I offered to him taking a break from each other so he can have fun there and be able to be with other people without being unfaithful. He told me he would rather stay in the relationship with me and we would try to make it work. \n\nSo my question is, what should I do? I want to be with him but don't want to hold him back from having fun. We would be able to text and FaceTime daily but we would only see each other about once a month. Do you think we could be in this kind of relationship for 4 years? Should we just take a break from each other? How can we make it work out?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [US] Seeking advice for friend\nPOST: Hello, /r/legaladvice,\n\nI'd like to present a case to you, though I'd rather keep some details as private as possible. I am a student in a medical profession program and will be graduating in 2016. My girlfriend is a classmate of mine as well. We recently took our boards examinations and got some of our scores back. I passed my test without issue. My girlfriend, however, received an email stating her scores were not going to be released due to a statistical anomaly that essentially mounts to 'we think someone cheated off of your test, but we can't prove it.'\n\nThis organizations contract states that they can void/cancel any test results with any evidence they see fit. Their statistical evidence is pretty hefty. \n\nThis has happened in the past with students at other schools who have appealed, but none have been successful. What is odd about this case is that the organization offered her to retake the exam at no charge. Our dean told us she had never heard of that before and she's the president of the association of schools, so she deals with these every year they come up. \n\nSome students in the past have submitted appeals. When those failed, they sought legal action. I would like to ask what you guys would suggest. We've already drafted a letter of appeal to state our case and what other evidence we could provide to help prove her innocence. It's a long shot at best. We also plan to compile character references from a few professors who know her academically and one of the deans of our school too. \n\nIs there anything else we could do? We could seek legal action, but I am not sure it would be worth it. The contract states that they reserve the right to cancel any tests at their discretion. There was one lapse in the contract I found that they did not technically abide by and could have helped prevent this from happening. \n\nAgain, any advice is appreciated. I've tried to keep details out of it, but will provide more if necessary. \n\nThank you!\nTL;DR:"}

No real issues between us.  \n\nHowever as we get older and our relationship goes on the topic of marriage is constantly on my mind and we've even discussed it various times in the past year. I have just now come to the realization that I don't want to marry him. I can't. He just doesn't feel like the one. We get along great, I think he's a great person, but I don't feel like he completes me the way he seems to think that I complete him.  \n\nAm I a complete bitch for not wanting to marry him? I do care for him and love him, however I just don't see a marriage in our future and I don't know how to tell him.

We've tried everything over the last two months: not speaking for a week at a time, trying to be friends, hooking up, arguing with each other.  It's been rough.  For the last few weeks we've been at a place of peace where we've both sort of let go and we can talk and occasionally hang out and been completely cool like old friends. \n\nA few days ago I went to a party and hooked up with someone for the first time since my ex.  She's really cool, and I have plans to see her again tomorrow.  I was so surprisingly content, I finally felt like I was letting go.  Last night my ex drunkenly called me at 3AM asking to stay with me cause her friends left her and she really wanted to see me.  I argued, but eventually let her.  She collapsed on my floor and started crying, apologizing for everything.  She said I'm the only person she cares about and she let me down.  I know how to deal with her when she's drunk, so I lulled her to sleep.  This morning was really nice, it felt like old times.  We kissed and talked about nothing.  I also told her about what happened Friday, and she really didn't mind.  \n\nI just talked to her on the phone and she said she really misses stuff like that, and she feels lonely without me now.  I've learned not to read too much into what she says or gain a false sense of hope of getting back together.  I really don't know what to do though.  I am still very much in love with her, and nothing compares.  I also like this new girl a lot, and I know there's potential there.  Should I move on or still hold out for my ex?  Should I just continue seeing both of them?  I'm really at a loss.\nTL;DR:"}

Although we broke up three years ago, we remain very close -- we work literally feet from each other at the same company and hang out often outside of work (completely platonically).  \n\nAlthough our breakup was somewhat rough, as I had developed some mental health issues (since resolved), we have maintained an excellent rapport.  We share many interests, senses of humor, and a deep mutual respect.  She is kind, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, and beautiful.  But we certainly have our differences as well, which contributed to the break-up.\n\nSince we split, we've both dated around but neither of us has found anything lasting.  I often fantasize about trying to get back together again with her, but I've never broached the issue.  First, I have my doubts as to whether she'd want to; second, I have even more serious doubts as to whether it would be a good idea.  While I think dating her again (provided she were interested) would make me happy in the short-term, in the long-term I feel like we might have incompatible visions for our lives.  There are things she wants out of life that I feel aren't what I see as my ideal future.\n\nI'm strongly attracted to this woman and a large part of me wants to be with her, and yet the other part of me thinks I need to face facts.  We have a deep bond that I don't want to harm, yet still feel a yearning when I think about her.\n\nI've maintained the present state of affairs for more than three years, and while it sometimes hurts, I treasure the relationship that we do have.  What would you do if you were in my shoes?\nTL;DR:"}

I was pleasantly surprised when mama cat came strolling in my yard with a mouse in her mouth, she dropped it off for the kittens and left again. I haven't been keeping a close eye on them since assuming they're just here temporarily, but they seems to take up residency underneath my deck because I saw the kittens playing on top of the pool cover this morning.\n\nI would love to adopt them but my boyfriend is extremely allergic to cats, so that option is out the door.  I left a little tray of water out for them and a cardboard box with some rags because I know it is going to get cold tonight. The kittens are about 1/3 the size of mom, and I assume they're eating solid foods already. Should I call animal control? Or local shelters? I'm just afraid if the kitties don't get adopted they will be put down, and that will break my heart.\nTL;DR:"}

She accepted and told her we could both come, because she was never really close friends with this girl, so if she's asking her she must be kind of desperate for people to invite. However, my girlfriend forgot that I already had plans to go to an event on the same day at the same time.\n\nI reminded her of my plans and she apologized for forgetting, but said that I would have to go since she already RSVP'd for me. I told her I wasn't happy that she RSVP'd without asking me first since it's someone I don't even really know and she hardly knows, and asked her if she could possibly call her back and tell her I couldn't make it. She said she wouldn't because she'd feel really bad since she acted so excited when she told her we could go. She also said she doesn't even really want to go either, but is basically doing it because she feels bad for her.\n\nSo the bottom line is that I don't want to go because I'd have to cancel my previous plans, but my girlfriend is telling me I have to. I already do stuff like this with her *all the time*, so I feel like one day to do what I want isn't asking for much. If this was her best friend or something, then yeah, I'd understand.

From the start there were occasional red flags, things I ignored, and things I didn't care about because I knew I was moving away. \n\nWe decided to go long distance because after about a month of dating things started going really well, but now 3 weeks after long distance, it's clear I want to end things. \n\nI found out some unfavorable news a few days ago, going back to the start of our relationship and I can't shake it. In the first weeks of us together she got with other people, and did not tell me. It's specifically messed up because we agreed we'd make sure we would tell each other if something like that happened because of possible STDs and other things. This and some other things I know make it clear I do not want to be in this relationship, as much as I love her, and especially like her as a person. \nPast that I saw some stuff on her phone making plans with other guys, then denying it. I mean I don't blame her completely because she knew I was moving away and we didn't know about what our future was, but it's still not appropriate for a relationship.\n\nSo now after 3 weeks of being long distance and feeling discomfort; I realize there was simply not enough trust built in the first 4 months we were physically together (if that's even possible for us to build that trust.)\n\nThe question is how do I break up with her. I really don't want to do it over text. The only thing is I feel like if we do it over a video chat it could get very messy. The other option I have to is write a letter? I am just not sure. We are suppose to see each other in a little less than 2 months, but thats a long time to wait, it's not feasible. I care about her immensely and want to do things the best way possible.

My boss basically said that he felt bad and couldn't say no when I contacted him before coming back this month, even though this is my third year working there during school breaks (did he think if he didn't contact me that I just would pretend the job hadn't existed?)\n\nNo one knows I saw this email.

Her mother and her have a toxic relationship and I'm being put in the middle of it sometimes to put out the fires that erupt occasionally. Constant fights with her and her siblings. I really care about her and it pains me to think of ending things but I feel like I've become a caretaker of sorts rather than a lover.

Her mom interacts with somebody that my girl has had a past inappropriate interaction with (before we dated) and it angers me a lot. Her mom doesn't know about that interaction and if she found out it would cause lots of drama. \n\nRecent I cannot stop thinking about possibilities of ending things but it is too much heartache to think of the damage it'll cause her.

Great!\n\nNow the problem.. I went away for 5 months to finish university(coming back every so often) and while I was away she started hanging out with two other guys and one of her girl friends. \n\nI was fine with this, until I noticed her delete messages from one of the guys when I was next to her. \n\nI eventually confronted her about this and she's told me it's because he texts her things like \"thanks for the blowjob last night\" or \"nice ass\" and so she didn't want me to get the wrong idea. Apparently nothing has happened that's just \"how the guy is\".\n\nWe spoke and I've pretty much said I don't want him messaging her like that.

I'm very concerned lately because some of the things she talk about are getting me annoyed.\n\nI remember that we used to have deep conversations, but now I'm beginning to think that a lot of the things she talk about are either superficial (celebrity news, gossip about friends) or complaints.

I really want to feel happy when I talk to her. It bothers me that sometimes I'd rather not talk to her about things on my mind. I know I should talk to her about it but what do I say?

Let's say my girlfriend's name is Mary.\n\nMy mother has narcissistic tendencies, and I've learned eventually how to deal with some of her nonsense. However, my mother makes snide comments about Mary anytime she is mentioned in conversation or when she realizes I'm speaking to her. It's not really unexpected since my mother hates almost everyone she interacts with, unfortunately, but her comments make my blood boil. I avoid responding in kind, however.\n\nAs a result of this, I make sure they don't meet (not difficult, since mom has no wish to do so and does not allow Mary into our house) so Mary doesn't get caught up in this ridiculousness. In the long term, I plan to remove my mother from the picture, going low to no contact with her. \n\nHowever, right now I feel like I'm just avoiding the problem because, as I see it, exposing the situation right now to my gf would be unnecessarily hurtful, as I don't see a short term solution which wouldn't involve fundamentally changing my mother. Also, because my future in-laws are well adjusted people, I fear Mary doesn't realize how bad it can get with mom.\n\nAm I dealing with this in the right way? A huge part of me feels shitty that I don't defend Mary, but I fear it'd be a fool's errand to change my mother's mind, and it would make my life at home even more of a living hell, since she loves to create drama and is practically 100% of the time at home (she does not work and has no hobbies nor friends whatsoever). I already get stressed out sometimes because of her, and I don't want to make the situation worse.\n\nExtra info: I plan to move out in 1~1,5 years. My dad is also full of mom's bs, but deals with it by being chill, pretty much.\nTL;DR:"}

During the move-out process I got a call from the landlord office saying I needed give them that money or it would be taken out of my security deposit. I had already given them the check (actually $312) two days previously, and informed the person calling. She said it likely just hadn't been processed yet, and assured me it would be fine. Checking my online banking account I see it has already been cashed (stamped with the landlords deposit info and everything), so I put it out of mind and continued with the tiring moving process.\n\nFast forward to now, I get my deposit check in the mail. Only $218 out of a $795 deposit. WTF. Looking at the breakdown, I see an item listed as \"outstanding amount\" under the header \"charges\". The amount is $313, the same as my last month's rent amount. \n\nI am not too worried about getting the money back ultimately if I wait, since I clearly wrote in the memo line \"partial rent, last month\" and it was cashed by the landlord. However money is tight right now, and it took them nearly a month to get this check to me. So on to the actual question: can I cash the $218 check without jeopardizing the unreturned $312? I don't want to cash it only for them to turn around and say the legal equivalent of \"you cashed it so you accepted it, too bad\". The $218 would be a big help right now, but the $312 is massively important long term.\nTL;DR:"}

I think she is very cute but she is taking things WAY to fast. She said we have a few options about how we can go about this: Officially date, secretly date, FWB, forget it happened. I chose secretly dating because I enjoyed cuddling her and kissing her, but I didn't really like her. And keep in mind, we've known each other for less than 6 hours, and now she wants to date?

My doctor advised me to stay at home, and study in a University at the city I'm from, which is a tier below in terms of academics compared to the University I'm enrolled in currently and has average placements. \n\nNow, I can either go back to the University I'm enrolled in, try making new friends (because my old friends are into drugs a lot) and study in an atmosphere which has stress and drugs, or try getting into the University back home at the cost of academic excellence (albeit a minor difference), my independence (since I'll have to stay with my parents) and also lose 2 years instead of 1. \nPlease help, any advice is welcome.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (20f) am self sabotaging my relationship with my boyfriend (22m)\nPOST: My boyfriend (22m) and I (20f) have been dating for almost a year and a half. He is everything I have ever wanted and we have a lot of fun together. \n\nAs I have gotten older I feel more and more like the crazy girlfriend. I get upset about silly things and have instant uncontrollable reactions to them. For example my boyfriend is an hour away across the border doing work. He has been gone for 6 days and we have had rather spotty communication because it is expensive to text and he only gets the occasional wifi signal. The other night I hadn't heard from him all day and began to get worried so worried that I couldn't sleep all night. Instead of rationalizing the thought that maybe he had bad reception I took it much differently. I held back tears as I went through the only plausible reasons that he was either dead or hated me now. I couldn't seem to release my self from this train of thought. Or another example is a few weeks ago he thought I was asleep and he was on reditt and opened a post from gone wild. I was deeply offended and instead if calmly explaining why I went off on him and yelled at him, once i finally snapped out of it I felt so disgusted with myself and the way I behaved because I know I don't want to be the kind of person who yells to have their point heard. \n\nThis all being said, a few months back I went to a counsellor and she discovered that I had low self esteem and abandonment issues. Because of the cost of counseling I had to stop going and now I feel like I'm getting worse. I can clearly recognize what is going on and why I feel that way but the feelings begin to override any rational calm thought I have and I lose it and become impulsive. I feel like if I continue to do this I will ruin my relationship. \n\nMy question is how do I control or learn to step away from a heated situation (that may very well be totally irrational) so I can sit down and discuss my feelings.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: Not sure what to do. (22m 21f)\nPOST: I'm in my last year of college. I haven't dated anyone since high school, for two main reasons. I've only met 2 girls in the past 5 years I considered worth the time and effort to try and date (including this one) and I'm afraid of failure, which is why I never did anything about the first one, so I'm pretty determined not to make that mistake again. I'm not saying I don't have female friends and hang out and whatnot, I just haven't really been interested in any other girls. I also am not particularly good at flirting.\n\nI've known this girl for a little while, but didn't really hang out much or talk until about a month ago. We ran into each other at a school soccer game, and chatted for a little while, and I felt extremely comfortable talking with her, more so than I usually do talking to beautiful girls. After that, whenever I saw her around campus she would always say hey and talk for a bit. I had a fraternity formal coming up, so I decided to ask her. We both had a good time, danced and talked and I really enjoyed her company. I invited her to go watch a movie afterwards, but she had pulled an all nighter before for a test that day, and had to be up early the next morning for something, and said we'd go watch a movie another time. It's been about a week since then, and we've talked a few times this week.\n\nSo I get the feeling she is at least somewhat interested. But she is really nice, bubbly, and outgoing, so I have this fear that she is only being polite. I'm just not sure how to go about flirting or asking her out on a proper date.\nTL;DR:"}

We had dinner, caught up with a few shows and it was time to sleep. Now this is where she goes on to tell me how she needs to go to the beauty salon to get her eyebrows done.\nTo which, my stupid response was \"yea, your eyebrows look pretty thick\". Casual boyfriend tip - never ever say that. My girlfriend must have gotten conscious as she keeps herself pretty well and starts to panic immediately. She jumps straight out of the bed and heads towards her bag where she keeps some waxing strips. (yea she keeps extra waxing strips in her bag, no idea if thats normal or not). \nShe heads straight to the mirror and starts to open the waxing strips. She could not wait until tomorrow and I don't own any tweezer, so the waxing strip was the only thing that she could use. Her game plan was to barely touch the strip to the eyebrow so she doesn't end up with a bald patch. \nThis is where I fucked up, I volunteered myself to do the waxing as I thought i could do a better job. I go on and touch the waxing strip to her eyebrow barely, however, the barely was apparently a bit too much. I had a feeling it was a bit too much, but all I could do was pray to the almighty lord of eyebrows and hope it all goes well. \nIt didn't. \nShe ended up with a few countable hair above her left eye and no sex happened in the house that night.\nTL;DR:"}

She helps me through a lot of stuff and is possibly the nicest person I have ever met, and I develop a huge crush on her. I ask her out, and she ends up saying yes in a roundabout sort of way, but wants me to take it very slowly. I agree, but inside I am a bit shaken as she never agrees to exclusivity, and I end up taking this out in various ways, by hooking up with a couple of people on the side and doing drugs (pot, cigarettes, nitrous) which she had not wanted me to do. I never tell her about this, and when she figures out, she is heartbroken (she had figured out once before and thought I was done). After all of this was over I dealt with the problems that had caused me to act in such a way, but I had hurt her so much that she couldn't forgive me.\nTL;DR:"}

I asked if she was saying she just wanted to be friends, she says no, she wanted to be friends with benefits, but not all the way benefits (no sex). I asked if she would still kiss me if I went for it, to which she says yes.\n\nShe says I can tell people we have a thing, just that we aren't official.

I'm from the Midwestern United States if that helps. \n\nMy cat is about 7 years old and very active and loving. Recently I noticed she's been getting thinner and not eating or drinking water. I thought she was just being moody because I went on a business trip and my SO cared for her alone for the first time. After 2 or 3 days of this she started puking up yellow bile so I took her to the vet. \n\nSo, there is something wrong with her liver. I wish I could say exactly what but I was so upset when the vet was talking to me that I kinda shut him out until he got to the treatment options. We opted to treat her at home and have been giving her medication orally through an eye dropper twice a day for the last two days. She hasn't started eating yet, and every time we give her the medication, well, it's clearly not something she is comfortable with. \n\nI'm worried that the medication may not be helping because I don't know if she is getting enough in the struggle. Vet said if she isn't starting to eat by Thursday or Friday it's probably hospital time. \n\nHas anyone else had to hospitalize their kitty with IV/tube feeding services? I literally moved out of my parents house a month ago and don't have much left in my savings as a result of moving costs. How much should I be prepared to pay? I intend to take her in no matter what, but I need to know if it'll mean pinching pennies or selling my car. Any insight is much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I said 'and your name is such and such?' to make sure I was moving the correct appointment and she thought I said 'and tomorrow is Monday?' so her deaf ass starts laughing at me and said 'uh yeaaah tomorrow is monday' and told her friends in the background so they could all laugh. \n\nAnyways, her appointment was for 4 and the only other thing that was open was at 11 the same day, so I told her and she asked if there was anything around 2, or 3. Well there wasnt. She said to go ahead and schedule and if she couldnt come she would call.  \n\nMy revenge? Normally when someone doesn't know if they can make a rescheduled appt, I offer to leave their current appointment on the books and if they can't make the earlier one, we can cancel it. I do this so they are gauranteed a spot because its peak tax business times and our appointments go like hot cakes. But since deaf ass wanted to laugh at me for her mishearing, I didn't offer to leave her second appointment available for her and canceled it. She probably won't be able to make the 11, but since I canceled the 4, that slot will also get filled and she wont be seen at all tomorrow!\nTL;DR:"}

Bear with me. \n\nI know this girl since 7th grade. We were in the same class for a few weeks before I left school because I moved to another city (not that far away but far enough to lose contact to most of my classmates and friends). We never really talked back then and I wasn't into her at all. \n\nWe briefly talked on facebook from time to time in the following years. At some point she mentioned that she is going to change schools for some reason and it turned out that she chose *my* school. So several years later, now in 11th grade, we are classmates again. \n\nI was (and probably still am) way to shy when it came to girls. So I never really approached her and we talked nearly never. In fact people were always surprised when they found out that we knew each other for years. We just talked more and more online but I think it was never her, who took the initiative. She was never my crush during the following three years of school but I always liked her and I think we got along pretty well. \n\nBy now I am out of school for some years but I still talk to her online. She never starts a conversation but I think she likes talking to me anyway. Maybe I am wrong about this?\n\nI still like her and I wish it was more than just a few conversations online. There is no other girl I feel that comfortable talking to. At this point I could picture a relationship with her although we haven't talked in person for years. Unfortunately she goes to a university hundred of miles away, so meeting for a coffee isn't an option.\nTL;DR:"}

We're planning on spending the summer together in his hometown (he never got to have a \"last summer at home\" for various reasons). He lives in a small town, but there is a city nearby. Here's the thing: he's helping to direct a musical that's taking place in his hometown that summer, in addition to working at a day care type program through the high school, and he's playing the piano for his church as well. I'm hoping to have a job, but that's really about it. I don't know a lot of people in his hometown, and the people I do know I know through him. I'm the type of person that hates not having something to do, and I'm worried that I'm going to spend most of the summer sitting around at home waiting for him to get back because he's going to be so busy and I'm really not going to be. So I'm asking: how can I avoid becoming a housewife in this relationship? He already knows that I feel like shit about myself because he does so much stuff and I don't do a whole lot, but the problem is, I just don't know what there is to do, especially in a town I'm not exactly familiar with. I want to maintain my independence in this relationship, but I feel like that's going to be hard to do if we spend the summer together in his hometown.\nTL;DR:"}

Her submissive behavior isn't what is causing a problem though, since we're working on building her trust and confidence with us and she's taking right to it.\n\nRandom things scare her--not noises, but objects. These seem to change every day. She'll be terrified of something one day and fine with it the next. I suspect this is just because she's getting used to her new home and to us, so the little things, I'm not worried about. She'll get over her terror of the dog-poop-bag-trashcan, since she's constantly exposed to it.\n\nThe other day, it was pouring when it was time for our morning walk, so I broke out the umbrella. The sound of the rain on it terrified her briefly, but she got over that after I showed her that it was okay, and we went on our walk. When we came back, however, I went to close the umbrella. NOPE. She FLIPPED OUT and pulled out of her harness (I tightened it afterward), then ran out into the rain and lay in the grass, crawling to me on her belly with some serious reservations. Luckily, she doesn't run from me and so she waited for me to come pick her soaking wet ass up and carry her into the house.\n\nI have a few questions. \n\n1.) Is this just a symptom of a fear stage?

I sat on her bed checking my phone and she sat right next to me. I just fucking sat there. I was afraid of putting my hand around her to cuddle. what the fuck. we leave, and come back about an hour later. same shit. I sit on a bed, she bounces onto the bed, and i fucking just sit there.\n\n I need some advice or motivation when chilling with people you've recently met and not pussying out. To be completely honest, i was afraid of the very small chance that she would make a big deal about it and be like \"what the fuck leave\".\n on a good note i got her number the day after but i was hoping i could make it apparent i wanted to rail her the first day.\nTL;DR:"}

While allowing the crust to soften as it sits off the heat, allows the steak to overcook and reduces the overall moisture.\n\nOf course I thought WWKS (what would Kenji say) and quickly dug up this old food lab article regarding resting of steaks: \n\nI then realised that after what I thought was the end of the article the original article directly points out the food lab method of cutting it in half in comparison to cutting bite sized pieces. In their eyes meaning minimal fluid loss that could be soaked up with a bit of steak on a fork.\n\nBottom line, I was wondering what your own opinions and experianced have been with each way.\n\nI personally haven't had enough cuts of steak around recently to attempt to try some experiments myself so im somewhere in the middle...\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Friend who has multiple personalities and see's demons needs suggestions on how to manage\nPOST: Ok so a bit of back story, I have been close friends with this girl for maybe two years for convenience lets call her Sam. We go to the same college together and live across the street from each other, she is not fond of her room mates so she is usually at my place. She does not currently have health insurance but things are starting to get worse. She see's things that she describes as demons, shadow people or actual people (like the chick from the ring movies) that like to mess with her. When these things make an appearance she attempts to ignore them but because they freak her out so bad she can not study while they are there. When things get really bad, as in the creatures run at her or get to close her other personality comes out. The second personality I will refer to as Megan (not her actual name) will appear when Sam can not deal with the creatures any more and the creatures are either afraid of Megan or Megan just does not care that the creatures are there. Sam as told me that she and Megan can \"share\" as in the are both present at a given time but that this is tiring for them so they do not do it often. I have met Megan and she is actually her own person with her own mind and personality which is similar to Sam's. There are a few other people that exist like Megan but for the most part they are not developed and have not chosen their names, they also rarely make an appearance. So far in the time I have known Sam I have met Megan, plus two others that do not have names but are refereed to as envy and innocence. The appearances of these creatures has increased recently and I was wondering if there is any type of herbal supplement that can help this? Or if anyone has experience with this type of thing? I try to help Sam when she starts to see things but am out of ideas. Any help or suggestions would be appreciative. I will be going to a test in a few hours but will try to get on to respond when I get out.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm telling you that because you would say that it's catfishing after you know that I met her like a month ago on the internet. We've been messaging each other like daily and we get along with each other very well.\n\nThe only problem is that she doesn't want to date yet but rather would like to do so in 2-3 months when the summer holidays begin. I told her that I would really like to see her, like really much and that only messaging for a long time isn't the best thing. Though, the next day I told her that I accept what she said and that I'm fine with it as long as we can phone, so it's not all about messaging.\n\nAlso, the reason why she doesn't want to date yet is that she feels unsure or unsafe, I don't know. She says that she wants to see me but she also told me that she might've never met someone through the internet in real life right after.\n\nSo... What can I do? Is it normal that she wants to date in 2-3 months?\n\nLike, she really seems to like me. She also said I should have my hair a bit shorter and not so unkempt and that I should shave my beard so it gets shorter and one could see my face way better.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Am I (20/m) in a toxic relationship (22/f)?\nPOST: We've been together a little while now. Everything has been pretty good up until a month or two ago when she graduated from college. She has very asian parents so she's not exactly allowed to date or see anyone. She has to stay at home and is pretty much under constant guard of her parents. I've met her parents on a few occasions and I have talked to them, but of course always as my SO's \"friend\".\n\nAnyways, ever since she's been staying at home, she's been acting more distant and detached. Not particularly caring about the relationship at all. And then she gets extremely worked up over really little things and causes big arguments over said little things. But when I get upset over something rather more serious (concerning her previous FWB talking dirty to her) and I get jealous, she acts like it's nothing and that I should just leave it alone, and forget about it. This got me really upset and for the first time, I got as mad as she usually does over the little things. I hope I'm not overreacting am I?\n\nA little backstory on her and this FWB. She was with this guy in a semi-serious relationship for about 8 months, which ended 1-2 months before I met her. During which the entire time, she would obsess over him but he would not reciprocate similar feelings to her. Anyways, they stopped talking for a while and only recently started talking again (about 3 weeks ago).\n\nShe says she feels safe, and that it's because of the things I do that makes her feel safe. And to be honest, I do try my best to make her happy. But I don't get any of that in return. Am I in a toxic relationship or am I asking too much when I ask for a little security in return? I've been feeling like shit for quite a while now, and I honestly don't know how long I can keep this up for.\nTL;DR:"}

Some I still remember like [Psipog] and [The Psion Guild] but a simple google search would lead to many more. These sites would be (and some still are) filled with huge collections of articles about how to become telepathic, telekinetic and all these other terms for different psychic abilities. At the time, I thought it was pretty much the coolest thing ever, although even at the beginning I was a bit skeptical. If people actually had these powers, why were they not scientifically tested? On the other hand I didn't think it was possible for so many people to sit down and write these huge articles and message boards all for the sake of trolling. So I tried some of the stuff for a couple of weeks. One exercise involved trying to move a pinwheel with your mind. I also made a set of Zener Cards to develop my telepathy.

Please be kind :)\n\nTIFU by nearly setting my house on fire, severely pissing off my housemates and terrorising my neighbour. \n\nNormal Thursday evening, making some dinner and putting some rice on to boil. Whilst everything is cooking I decide to go take the rubbish out. We live above commercial premises so it's super easy, you just stick the bin bag outside the door and it's gone by morning (yay for London refuse collectors!)\n\nDue to the simple and quick nature of this task, didn't feel the need to take my keys with me as it's literally just sticking a bin bag outside the front door. So I take the bin bag out of our door and go down to the main door, and with out thinking shut our flat door behind me, open the main front door and put the bin out. \n\n.... And then realise what I've done. So I've put a pan of rice on to boil, nobody else is in my house, and I've locked myself out in my jammies. Fuck. \n\nTry calling my landlord, all he says is 'I'm watching the football and I live 10 miles away so I'm not coming. Try and get the neighbours to help.' The only neighbour I vaguely know is the man who owns the corner shop on our block, so I decide to give him a try. Only in my panic I run into the shop loudly stating 'I've locked myself out of my house and if I don't get in soon there's going to be a fire'. Unfortunately, said shop owner only speaks very basic English so all he latches on to is 'fire'. So he starts freaking out and running round grabbing tools to help me get in the flat. \n\nWe reach my front door and he starts going at the door like a mad man with a hammer and chisel. He knocks through the lock and still the door doesn't open. He then starts trying to break the wood panels on the door to no avail. Just as we're both at breaking point we realised we could've just smashed a small hole in the doors top glass and reached in to unlock the Yale lock. So yeah, we did that and got straight into my now rice-smoke-filled flat.\nTL;DR:"}

Yes, I drink, but I don't get black-out drunk (like most of my friends) because I think it's not as fun. I flirt, I've had good and bad relationships, but the last one ended 7 months ago and I'm treading water.

I see them get treated like garbage and I tell them they deserve better and stand beside them and support them, possibly flirting with them and just being who I am. But not one of them gives me a second glance. Yeah, they flirt a bit and say how nice I am but then I never get a second glance.\n\nI'm not saying that everyone should be all over me like I'm hot stuff or whatnot, but I'm losing confidence and hope for who I am. I'm losing faith in myself and getting sad that maybe I am actually a bad person and no one has the guts to tell me. Yeah, I might sound paranoid, but this is really getting to me. \n\nThey all overlook me, and I'm sick of it. \n\nI want someone to hold, but they just look at the big and popular guys, not the one (me) who is there and actually talks to them.\n\nI feel like women underestimate how fun and interesting a nice guy can be, and just dismiss him because he's nice and respectful.\n\nThank you for reading, seriously.

However, she doesn't want to actually start dating until we both go to college on August 21st. She is half Filipino / half English , and her mom is the Filipino side and is extremely controlling and doesn't want her to date. She wants to wait until she escapes to college and has her freedom.  This is fine, as we're both going to the same college and can essentially see each other every day.\n\nMy issue is I don't know exactly how to deal with the wait. I told her I'm okay with waiting a month. However until then what do we do? Everytime we talk it's just constant flirting essentially. Also, personality wise I'm an extremely emotionally attached / needy person , and I've told her this and she's told me she's very okay with it. Is it okay for me to constantly express my feelings to her even though we're not technically dating? I really want to see her now,but I can't, and I'm still in the end okay with waiting.

I am his first everything and he's very conservative when it comes to sex (i.e. waiting for \"the one\"), while I was a little more \"adventurous\" in high school and slept around some (5 partners over 2 years, always used protection, STD tests, etc.). Sometimes he'll ask questions about whether I've done something or not, and more often than not, it's not an answer he wanted to hear. Or I'll indirectly mention that a particular thing is fun, and he'll get bummed out that I've already done it. \n\nIt's pretty clear to me that we have different opinions on what sex means, and I really want to know how I can possibly make him feel better. There's lots of stuff I want to try with him that it WOULD be my first time trying, vaginal sex just doesn't happen to be one of those. I really, really try not to bring this kind of stuff up, but I also don't want to be dishonest.

We finally sat down and talked through some things and it started looking up the last week of June.

It threw me off because I thought we were doing so much better after our conversation and the week after that was great. We talked about this in person a few days ago and he said he had been feeling this way for awhile and didn't bring it up because he thought he could just get over it. He doesn't know if we are meant to be together anymore. Since he's gone so much this month because of his custody agreement with his other daughter we don't get much time together, so he agreed to see how things go next month and we go from there. \n\nI feel like I've already lost him. I'm usually so closed off, but I let him in because he was different. He made me feel loved, special, sexy and everything I've never truly found with someone.

Will I  have to quit/lose my job? Or do I find somewhere to live whilst i work here through summer, so I can hold down a job I might not necessarily have after summer during term time, and end up earning less than I would at home?\n\nI know that staying here and holding a job down through summer might be best in the long term, but i feel if i stay here through summer I'll be missing out on everything and everyone back home and will be insanely homesick.\n\nThanks for your time, M.\nTL;DR:"}

I respected her wish and agreed to wait for her until marriage. We did a lot of other stuff, but never fully did. \n\nFast forward 3 days ago. She breaks up with me. She tells me we are too codependent and that we need to find ourselves outside of a relationship. She said I manipulated her because I asked her if she could keep her hair long and told her I liked a certain dreas. I shouldn't tell her what to do or wear and she needs to find herself without me. \n\nAlright. Fair enough. Today, I find out that she had sex with some guy she's known for 3 months who doesn't even know her. She texts me out of guilt.

A few months into our freshman year, he got a girlfriend, who I'm friendly with, though not as close to as I am to him. I'm lesbian and they both know I'm not interested in him. They both consider me his closest friend at our college, and one of his few friends here at all.\n\nYesterday I was feeling upset, and talked to my friend about it. We talked about the future and I mentioned I would be happy remaining single and just being surrounded by friends.\n\n He told me that \"You might not want to hear this\" but that eventually I'll need to settle down because friends just aren't important and friends come and go (unlike an s/o), and he probably won't talk to me (or anyone else from any point before in his life aside from his girlfriend and family) after he graduates. That if I really want to be happy in life I need to settle down with someone because married people won't want to be friends with a single person.\n\nI don't expect to remain friends with him (or most of my friends) for the rest of my life, but I still feel a little hurt? That as soon as he graduates, I- and everyone else in our friend group- will never hear from him again. And I was finally happy and convinced I could live a happy and fulfilling life without one, and then he said I'll never be happy later in life unless I have one.\n\nI guess what I'm hoping for here is for someone to tell me he's wrong, or that they remained close to college friends after graduation.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm also getting a weird vibe from her but that could be me just imagining things..\n\nThis is where I get my doubts about her still having feelings for me. It might sound a tad childish but here goes. She sent me a screenshot of another guy \"poking her\" on Facebook. She claims it to have been an accident, but I doubt it. It's also a guy I'm sure she has interest in. The next thing are three tweets from her..The first being \"not sure how to tell you this..\" then \"things have changed a lot since Saturday at lunch\" (I was the one with her on Saturday for lunch) and finally just \"sorry..\". Now what the heck does that mean?\n\nI'm tempted to tell her I don't have feelings for her and that I see her only as a friend. Even though I know if she started dating another guy it would hurt.

Am I just being crazy?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years, and for the most part it's been great. Recently we started going to the same university so I'm able to see him a bit more than before. He's going to school to become an ER surgeon and has always been extremely serious about studying and getting good grades, which I'm very understanding of. He also gets stressed out easily so I always try to do little things like bake him cookies, clean his room, send him naked pics, give him back rubs, random blow jobs ect.. Lately I feel like when ever I do these things for him I get a simple 'thanks' or some equally dull response. To add to this I can't think of the last time he's done something for me 'just because' (I could probably count on my fingers how many total times he's done stuff like that during the 4 years we've been together). Every time I think this way I start to feel guilty and tell myself that he's just probably really stressed and I'm being selfish. But I don't know anymore. Our relationship consists of him doing school related things all day, with a few dull text exchanges in between, and then seeing each other at night for dinner, catching up on a tv show, possible mediocre sex, and then going to bed. I try to get him to do fun and random things to add some adventure into our lives but he's usually always not interested. He comes up with excuses like 'but baby we have to wash the dishes first' or 'honey I need to wait until my clothes are done drying'. It's really starting to make me sad. I guess my question for you all is am I overreacting? I don't know if I should just stop whining and continue to do nice things for him with little to no reciprocation, or actually consider taking a more drastic action..\nTL;DR:"}

Basically, I gave her multiple reason to dismiss their opinions and to respectfully tell them to go fuck themselves.  \n These women, who have never attempted this event nor any difficult race for that matter, are perfect examples of people who truly have never challenged themselves to do something far outside of there comfort zone.  They are examples of people who hate the fact that someone else is challenging themselves and believes they can do something that is out of the ordinary.

I've had the same best friend since high school, we'll call him Bob. I've hung out at Bob's house frequently for the last few years, becoming fairly close with his whole family, including his brother and his brother's girlfriend. We'll call them Adam and Alice. Long story short, a few years ago Alice and I had a discrete friends with benefits relationship while she was dating Adam. We decided it was best to stop before anyone found out. Since then they've had a rocky relationship and just recently broke up. I'm sure they'll be back together soon (this stuff happens pretty frequently) but she's been rather flirtatious with me lately since the breakup. I honestly really like her and feel like I could make her happy, but of course this would be at the risk of burning a lot of bridges. I haven't talked to her about it, so I have no idea if she'd even be interested in a serious relationship with me. In general, I would usually wait at least a few months before pursuing a friend's ex-girlfriend but given the history here, I find it hard to resist for that long. Should I just talk to her about it in a straightforward way? I'm not sure how she'll react, I guess it could potentially ruin our friendship and my friendships with Bob/Adam. If I do talk to her and she accepts, should we be discrete or just come out in the open about it? I'm honestly not that great of friends with Adam and if he wants to cut ties with me over it, I wouldn't care that much. But losing Bob as a friend would cause a lot of problems. Is there a way to do this without anyone's feelings being hurt?\nTL;DR:"}

I liked her enough to ask her out, we went on a first date about 2 weeks ago. It was really pleasant, I felt very relaxed but excited to hang out with her.\n\nShe was traveling in Europe for past 1.5 weeks, but she has since returned.

I haven't really dated very much (dated same girl since senior year of college till about 6-7 months ago). So, here are my questions:\n\n1. I didn't make a move last time because I felt like she's a conservative girl and also, since I hadn't seen her in almost 2 weeks, I personally felt like holding off. That's ok, right?\n\n2. When I first reached out to her, it was via Facebook. Thus far we've only communicated about dates via Facebook, but we exchanged phone numbers when we were to meet up last time (not last night). Should I message her on Facebook or should I text her?\n\n3. I'm thinking of either taking her to a cool art show OR to my favorite park in our little city (very peaceful, cute park that few people know about so its one of my favorite places to hang out on a good weather day) during the day on Saturday or Sunday. Does that sound like a good progression / sensible date? I don't want it to feel very intense, but I obviously do want her to have fun and do something interesting!\n\nThanks for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

Although I originally planned to return to Austin after a couple of weeks, I have had a family emergency, and have to lengthen my visit. Our cat sitter is going on vacation this Thursday (6/13), and so I have two days to find a new place for them.\n\nAbout the cats: both are extremely low-maintenance and sweet. And holy shit they are cute. The boy is an orange tabby named [Homer.] He is the alpha of the two, loves attention and playtime, and is very social. The girl is a beautiful black and grey domestic long-haired cat named [Maeby.] She is shyer and is not as affectionate as her brother, but after she warms up to you she will try to get you to pet her at every opportunity. Both are up to date with their shots and are spayed and neutered. They are not declawed and are indoor cats. My previous roommate had another cat and a chihuahua, and Homer and Maeby did fine with both of them, although they avoided the dog as much as possible.

Conflicting feelings. What's my next move?\nPOST: Some background: We met one month ago, I found her incredibly attractive and wanted to know more about her. Started messaging each other and chatting when we were together. We don't have a lot in common, but like to hear about each other's interests. Asked her on a date but discovered she's seeing another guy (who I had no idea exists).\n\n----\nNow for current matters: Typically I try to distance and preoccupy myself when I need to get over something. That's not really an option in this case. We are both going to be working together in two small academic related clubs, so we're going to be seeing each other often and will be working together. I'm also a very outgoing guy, and like to organize things with friends. I've already invited her to an event I'm hosting. I'm worried I'm going to get very frustrated being in constant contact, but it will bother me to exclude her in the future. With this coming year being my most important year at university, I'd like to avoid issues when I can.\n\nAs much as I'd like to win her over, I feel like that will cause more issues than I'm willing to deal with, especially when it means interfering with an existing relationship. However, there's no evidence on facebook that she has a boyfriend and I've never seen her with a guy, but he may be long-distance or simply busy. She made a point of how I couldn't have known she was seeing someone. When I asked her if she would prefer I restrain our friendship, she said she enjoyed talking to me, wanted things to continue, and told me not to worry about possible issues between us.\n\nDo I try to cut her away? Is she trying to tell me things are ending with the boyfriend? Do I just need to deal with it? \n\nObviously I'm going to want see things in a way where I get the girl, but I'm thinking I should tell her I need some time away. Is there a good way to do this? I'm not afraid to be honest, but I don't want it to sound harsh because we're going to need to work together.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What affect e-book prices, and why isn't this being done?\nPOST: I've delayed buying an e-reader because I enjoy having a physical book in my hands.  I like the tactile feel of books, the weight, smell, and turning pages.  However, I'm going to be traveling extensively soon and can't lug a library with me, so I was considering getting a Kindle.  After looking on Amazon, I was surprised to find that Kindle books more expensive than hard-covered books.  \n\nWhat affects or who is setting e-book prices?  It costs substantially more to print and distribute a physical book, and I can't justify paying $20 for an e-book when the hardcopy is available for $10.  Wouldn't a more profitable system be to sell the hardcopy at a higher price, then allow people to either have a free copy of the e-book or charge an extra $2 for the e-book?  \n\nMy thought process is that many people, like myself, enjoy having physical books.  I like collecting books and having a bookshelf.  One of my favorite things as a kid was browsing through my parent's giant bookshelf whenever I was bored and finding something new; however, this experience can't be shared with a collection of e-books.  It's the same reason people still buy CD's - some people like to have the physical CD and accompanying artwork, but then they rip the CD to have their collection be portable.  So in the long run, if I buy the hardcopy for less and torrent an e-copy, isn't the publisher losing more money than selling the hardcopy and ebook together for $2-5 more?\nTL;DR:"}

He's a pitbull mix and 60 pounds of love. \n\nIn 2015, we began applying for an overseas career opportunity and making arrangements for a new family for our dog. Our dogsitter, Lianna, loved Ghost, and Ghost loved her. She had two teenage boys and a large country property. We asked her if she'd be interested in adopting Ghost when we left the country, and she wholeheartedly agreed.\n\nIn 2016, we were accepted for the overseas opportunity, leaving in November 2016. Our lease ended in May, as did our academic jobs, and we moved in with my partner's grandparents in the country. Our grandparents had been hesitant about Ghost, but after spending time together, they bonded with Ghost and fell in love with him. \n\nLianna also developed cancer with a 50% terminal rate and announced her plans to divorce her husband and move into the city. She works a full-time job and want custody of her two sons as well. \n\nNow we're conflicted. Ghost has been living with the grandparents for several months while we've been traveling. They've provided free care for him and they've developed a bond. They can give him stability and happiness. They live in the country and are retired, so Ghost spends all day hanging out with them. Plus, they're family, and they've provided us with months of free rent, and we don't want to strain relations by taking Ghost away from them now.\n\nLianna still wants to adopt Ghost. She is a very emotional person and loves Ghost. We feel like we're doing the right thing by having our grandparents adopt Ghost, but we also feel like we're screwing over someone with cancer.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [Tennessee] Question about including managers in tip pooling.\nPOST: I'm a manager at a small locally-owned restaurant that is one of 3 in a local chain. Our setup is a bit like a Moe's or Chipotle, in that you start at one end of a line of food and instruct a clerk on what you'd like on your burrito, tacos, quesadilla, etc. We have a tip jar by the register and at the end of the shift, tips are distributed evenly 100% among the staff. We are not a full service restaurant, but our particular branch prides itself on its service so we are very friendly and sociable with our customers and even after they've paid and sat down we'll come out from behind the line to check on their meal, offer refills, and clear finished plates and dishes.\n\nNo one is paid server wages, and indeed everyone's hourly rate is well above minimum wage, and with tip pooling you're probably gonna leave a shift with at least $20 cash in your pocket.\n\nThe problem is that up until our regional manager started looking into tip pooling rules after finding out about the class action suit against Starbucks a few years back, managers were included in the tip pool. This never struck anyone as unfair because the managers have the exact same duties as the regular clerks. We don't have an office or kitchen to retreat to until we're needed, we're on the line making food and serving customers as much (if not moreso) than a non-manager. But because we're no longer a part of the tip pool, the clerks are now making profoundly more money per shift than the managers. And obviously this isn't sitting well with any of us. Suddenly we're getting paid way less for the same job that someone else is getting paid more to do, and without the added responsibility of being a manager.\n\nMy question is, is there a legal way we can still participate in these pools? The owner seems unwilling to raise our hourly rate to make up for the difference. As the de facto head manager, I've done all I can to try to placate my staff and get them to hang on but I fear for a mass exodus if a solution can't be found.\nTL;DR:"}

We have met up 3 times and the last one, which ended over 2 weeks ago, we were together for 8 weeks. Now when she flew back she's cried every day since and thinks i hate her crying in front of me. \n\nAt first i was upset, i was very upset as you could expect and this lasted for around a week. So we both cried together and tried to make one another feel better. However, we argued a few times when she was crying and she says that i hate her crying in front of me now. This is not the case, the only times i have gotten angry and argued when i have had work in the evening, get home around 11 and then she cries for around 2-3 hours and i try to make her feel better but it does not work. This is the only time we argue when she cries, the reason i get mad at this time is because i have work the next morning and have to get up at 6:45 and if i'm up until 2am in the morning trying to make her feel better but nothing happens.

He said that he wonders what it would be like in other relationships, he said that he sometimes misses the freedom and lack of responsibility of singledom, and he said that he doesn't feel like it's fair for me to be in this relationship when he is experiencing these doubts.\n\nI understand his feelings and doubts, but I've been in several other relationships and I believe that what my boyfriend and I have is special and something that I want to sustain. I feel like if we had started dating after my boyfriend had been in other relationships, then we wouldn't have come across this issue. I don't know what to do, and I don't know what to tell him.\n\nHas anybody else been in this situation, and if so, do you have any advice for me?\nTL;DR:"}

Probably the least challenging job I've ever had. exactly 1 out of 3 of my coworkers was genuinely a hard worker. My manager was okay, but I just wasnt as happy as I wanted to be.  I liked most of the people that came through my line and was always cordial and friendly. One day one of my customers asked me if I was happy there. I thought it was kind of strange and made up an answer along the lines of \"it's okay, I like my customers of course :) \" and she told me the reason she asked, was they are constantly hiring upstairs, and she suggested I apply. I sent in my resume. This girl, who doesnt really know me as much besides the girl who gives her a discount on energy drinks occasionally, made sure the hiring department called me back and gave me a phone interview! Which led to me taking their skill test, and getting a real interview. Which led to me getting a job! $14/hr, full time with chances of overtime, full benefits. 3 wks PTO a year, a 401k which the company matches! \nI'VE NEVER HAD A JOB THAT PAYS OVER 9/HR!!!! :) \nAdmittedly when I worked on a restaurant in Florida, my tips made my wage more than 9/hr, but still.

During the summer it gets hot as hell and one of the best things to do is go swimming. Just like any other normal day, I head over to a friend's place and we invite some people over and go swimming. We were drinking, having a good time, and eventually our fun ended and I headed home. I go to sleep later that night and wake up a few hours later with a throbbing pain in my ear. I think it's probably from swimming and I must have water lodged in my ear. So, I try shaking my head, jumping on side and nothing is working. I head to our local 24/7 walmart and pick up some ear drops that are supposed to get rid of any lodged water. Nope. Not working still. The pain is getting worse and worse to the point where I try to find a 24 hour walk in clinic. Everywhere is closed, and at this point I can't bear the pain anymore, so I head to the emergency room. The nurse sees me, I explain my issue and she takes a look in my ear. She says that something is in there and she goes and grabs some tweezers to get it out. \n\nAfter a few seconds, she pulls out her tweezers, and LOW AND FUCKING BEHOLD, SHE HAS A HALF OF A LIVE COCKAROACH IN THE TWEEZERS. The little fucker is still moving. It must have crawled in my ear while I was sleeping. She goes back into my ear and pulls out the other half of the roach, that part of it's body still alive as well.  \n\nFuck Florida. I will forever sleep with earplugs for the rest of my life.\nTL;DR:"}

Advice, ideas, how to best prep her?\nPOST: So, we have a 10 month old GSD pup. I am fairly well experienced in dog ownership and training.\n   She has been pretty well socialised her entire life, recently had a very noisy barking phase which was almost entirely conquered by more socialising with people and other dogs plus an increase in training around distractions.\n  \nShe gets taken to the local dog-beach frequently, two woodland/field walks per day plus lead manners/socialising daily. Twice a week she gets taken to the local pub(s), also to the nearest town (we are in a tiny welsh village so her exposure to stimuli is somewhat limited).  \nWe are currently working on her barking when the postman arrives, due to our location we have maybe a 2 hour window of when they -might- arrive. She alarm barks, we thank her, get her to 'down' & quiet for which she gets a treat. We are extending the period between 'quiet' and the treat day by day. \n  \nI am slightly concerned about how to best prepare her for people in the house. We rarely have other people in the house as all our relatives live hundreds of miles away.  \nSimple answer to my question would be to crate her out of sight, but her crate has always been in the kitchen.\n  \n  Our house has a weird layout, her crate is in the kitchen but the kitchen is first floor. It goes ground floor - guest/entertainment room, first floor - kitchen & living room, bedrooms & bathroom top floor. \n  I am looking for advice on how I can up her training in the next few weeks to get her to better cope with the upcoming situation.\n  \n  Obviously guests would be using the kitchen. Should I just put her crate in our bedroom and shut her away all evening?\n  Should I try to introduce her to guests whilst on the lead?\nTL;DR:"}

Sure enough I was on there with all kinds of info that really creeped me out. I'm sure this is / will be a problem in itself but the thing that concerned me today is that some of the info on there is wrong. Some of the info on there had my name for the residence of my father who I have not spoken to in years (I know it's his because my mother confirmed it)!\n\nThe reason me and my father haven't spoken is because in the past he used my name and SS# to open up credit cards and leave me with the debt (that was fun paying off right after graduating college $40,000 in the hole). In the past the only option I had was to have the credit card company do an investigation that would surely turn up as fraud on his part.  I declined, not having enough heart to send my old man to prison. Now some years later it seems that he might have used my name and other info to rent an apartment! Recently I enrolled in one of those services that notifies you when your SS# is used so I feel somewhat protected from this happening in the future.  I also checked my credit report and nothing unusual was on there. I guess my question is - what would you do? I don't want to file criminal charges and I don't want to try and contact the landlord of the apartment to correct this info out of fear that they'll kick him out. Am I being soft? Do I need to sack up and put this dude in prison? I mean he's friggin 70 something years old now!  \n\nSidenote: He is kind of scumbaggy.

Worried that concealing a fetish is unhealthy but equally worried that confessing to it could ruin our relationship.\nPOST: I've been with my girlfriend for 2 years now and I have enjoyed every minute of our relationship emotionally. I think she's beautiful, clever and I find her easier to relate to and more supportive than any of my ex's and we have loads of common interests and to be honest if stuff keeps going this way I could see myself proposing to her.\n\nThere's just one problem that I know I have to deal with at some point: for as long as I can remember I've had a fat fetish. I get turned on by the idea of girls gaining weight and find larger girls really sexy. I realise that this has lots of horrible baggage relating to control and superiority, but let me just make clear that it is just the weight I find attractive: the idea of forcing somebody that didn't want to put on weight is horrible to me.\n\nThis is where the two threads of thought come head to head. My girlfriend isn't remotely close to being overweight, she's pretty skinny. I don't know whether to confess my fetish to her, and if so how much to say. I know that it will just make her insecure that I don't find her attractive enough. However, although I wouldn't want her to get unhealthily overweight, I can't deny that if she put on about 10 lbs I'd find her so much more attractive.\n\nIf I did decide to tell her I'm not sure how I'd lead up to it. She's pretty into BDSM, something I'm not really into at all, but I've enjoyed giving her pleasure by having BDSM sex. I'd imagine she wouldn't mind combining food and sex, something I'd find really hot, but putting ok weight affects you outside of the bedroom.\n\nSo, what should I do? Should I keep hushed about everything? Should I just tell her I have a fetish for eating during sex now? Or should I tell her about the weight thing as well?\nTL;DR:"}

His exact words were \"things will be different once you're 90lbs and in a bikini, I'll fix you and then you'll leave.\"   \n\nI don't know what to do about any of this. Please help?\nTL;DR:"}

Now, I'm almost debt free and even have some savings. \n\nIt's seems now that my fiancee is making the same mistakes I've made in the past. I always try to help her to make good choices, such as don't buy things that you don't have the money for, or don't keep you credit card maxed, don't take more credit than you can handle. Unfortunately, she does them all. She is a student, so she works part time and does not have a lot of money. When she got her first credit card, I told her to not use it for dumb things she doesn't need and not to max it out. She did the opposite. Went shopping, bought stuff she didn't need and couldn't afford, maxed it out pretty quickly, kept it maxed for a long time. I took it away from her until she could pay it off a little bit. She paid off a little, then she needed the card for a legitimate reason. I gave it back to her and she did the same thing all over again. This has happened multiple times. She has proven to be consistently irresponsible.\n\nI've told her in the past to not increase the limit on her card since she will likely get into trouble with it. Today, she went to the bank and they offered to increase her limit by 5 times what it is now. She took it. Didn't even ask me and we're going to be married in a few months... I'm pissed. Besides that, I would like to have it reversed, but I don't know if that will negatively affect her credit, or if it's even possible. We are in Canada, if that makes a difference.\nTL;DR:"}

Today, after class, we were sitting in her car talking, and she leaned over and started kissing me (which was uncomfortable cuz you gotta lean over the cup holder and what not, but its fun so whatever). While we were putting our faces together, she would slip her tongue in there and I would pull back a bit, then it'd be normal, then tongue a, and I pull back, and over and over for about 20 minutes until I had to leave.\n\nHere is what I am asking you: What the hell am I supposed to do? She told me that we should slow it down, but she is the one trying to get all hot and heavy! Do I respect her wishes from a week ago and tell her to knock it off, or if she's offering, why not take her up on the offer?\nTL;DR:"}

It's senior year for us and next year we'll most likely be going to different colleges. I've been with her since the end of freshman year so I feel that I've never really gotten the chance to branch out and try new things. \n\nShe hates going to parties with people she doesn't know and with things she doesn't approve of. Drinking, for example, is something she hates to see me do. I have had a few drinks with my friends in the past I promised her that I was responsible with it, but yet she still hates me for even thinking about doing it. Homecoming was just last weekend and instead of going to a fun afterparty, I was stuck with her and her annoying friends all night watching shitty chick flicks in her basement. I told her about a party after the dance and she simply replied, \"I don't think that's my scene. I want to hang out with you and my friends.\" This has happened in the past a few times but I've never really had the balls to say anything cuz I feel I might hurt her. I'm starting to feel that I need to say something soon or it's just going to be bad for the rest of senior year.\nTL;DR:"}

I have very little experience with women. I also do not really have any friends, and my psychologist says I have social anxiety. Me and this girl talked for a while at the rehearsal dinner, but at the wedding and afterwards did not really have one on one time (a lot of people that I hadn't seen since high school were there, so I talked to them mostly). I don't really have any friends, which is why I am asking this question to you all instead of someone else. \n\nOur company christmas party is apparently some high class affair (I have never been to one, just got promoted to a position that gets invited), and I would prefer to not go alone, even though that is the default plan obviously. I was wondering if it would be strange for me to ask my SIL to invite this girl as my date to the party? Or to ask for her number and invite her myself? I really have no idea how to go about this. I just don't want to come of as some weird inept loser, so I am asking you all before I think about bringing it up to my brother.

I was always gifted in the intelligence department but as most learn, work ethic and self-motivation are much more valuable qualities when it comes to success and happiness.

Here are a couple examples\u2026.\n\nWhen my mother told me, while holding back tears, that she hoped I didn't end up like the homeless man we had seen, my grades immediately improved and I began to put much more effort into my education. My toughest classes are often the ones I get the best grades in because I am scared to death of them. At 21, I went on the first date of my life after I developed a fear that I would never meet a girl.\n\nI find over and over again that even though I have desires and goals in life, it is the fear of consequences and failure that really gets me to take action. This has lead to some proud moments in my life but it also means that I have little control as to when my motivation is flipped on and oftentimes I will settle for mediocrity.

While she was folding laundry at the kitchen table, I had the bright idea to \"pants\" her. I casually walked up behind her as to give her a sweet embrace when suddenly I yanked down her sweatpants exposing her Sunday morning delicates aka granny panties. We laughed, she smacked me, I credit card swiped her, she smacked me again and then it was over. Ten minutes later I was patiently waiting for my waffle to prairie dog out of the toaster when I hear the faintest of footsteps. Before I could turn around she had grabbed ahold of not only my gym shorts but my boxers as well. She forcefully tore both to the floor exposing not only my bare ass but my mini Emilio Estevez as well. Laughing ensued and we decided to call a truce. But I couldn't let her have the last say in all of this. So the saga continued all Sunday long. I'll be honest, at around 4 o'clock the whole thing started to get exhausting. I was living in constant fear of having my pants pulled down to my ankles. Eventually it was time for bed. We lost track of who was winning the war and the constant barrage of pants pulling had seemingly stopped. That was until she left her guard down. It was lights out time and instead of getting up to turn the switch off, she decided to kneel on the bed and turn it off with the drawstring. This was it, the pantsing to end all pantsing. As she reached up, I grabbed ahold of her silk nighty and pulled down with a great amount of force. But this time the sound of giggles and laughs were accompanied by a loud ripping noise. No, she didn't fart in my face, I had torn her brand new silk pants at the waste band. Apparently she had tied them rather tight as to avoid getting pantsed again. Not only did I win the war, I Hiroshima'd her ass. We entered into a verbal contract with one another and each rolled onto our own side of the bed.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What's your experience of ghosts? Do you believe in them?\nPOST: I'm not particularly superstitious. But I know something weird happened one night.\nLast year I suffered from severe depression, with, at its worst, bad panic attacks and agitation. My friend used to let me sleep over at her place when I was really upset to give me a break from my home and family. One night when I was feeling particularly irrational and unwell, I was over at her place again and slept beside her in her bed. In the middle of the night, I jolted awake, feeling that I had been asked a question and shouted out 'Yeah, Jo?' and there was her face (I thought it was), just there above mine, but then I turned my head and she was there beside me, fast asleep. Then that face disappeared. I think a door closed.\nI don't remember too well because I was half-asleep, but the strangeness of it was still clear as day. It was a scary realisation when she was just there, sleeping, and the figure above me wasn't Jo. I just went back to sleep. I don't rule out that I hallucinated because I was so distressed, but despite my history of mental illness I have no real history of psychosis, or anything involving hallucination. I stand by having seen what I saw because the experience was so intense.\nSix months later Jo said she saw the ghost too, just wandering across the living room, a transparent greeny-purple flash, a young girl that she only saw out of the corner of her eye. And she said the same thing, that she doesn't believe in ghosts, but she was what she saw. It's an old house, and we're both pretty unnerved about it, and love talking about it, but we were never all-out scared, funnily enough.\nTL;DR:"}

With several other club board members, we allocate and organize finances to attend competitions and plan events. Our finances must be approved by school admins before we can act on it. None of the work we do is paid by the school. \n\nThis past year, we have had major issues regarding two members who have been stepping out of line and disrespecting us despite our efforts. This has created a slight schism within our club that I want to address because I care a lot about this club and don't want it to dissolve because of personal conflicts. \n\n**Member A**:\n1. One of the oldest members. A is also talented in the sport so that has earned him respect.\n2. **BUT** ANGER ISSUES (i.e. huge argument with school admin-> bad rep for club) \n3. Despite his well intentions to contribute more the club, his temper has really deterred any board member from allowing him to make contact with school officials. Meanwhile, he has continued to criticize our efforts. I can't get him to understand that we are a small force that can only do so much.  \n\n**Member B** \n1. Formerly held unofficial position but was removed due to a miscommunication. Costed the club several hundred dollars. Never apologized for his actions. \n2. Requested him to do favors for the club because without his help, we wouldn't be able to attend a tournament. He refused and only offered the favor when we held an emergency meeting with the coach regarding this situation. \n\nWhile our coach is not affiliated with the school, we plan on asking our coach for advice. \n\nMaybe I'm holding too big of a personal grudge but since these members will be around for at least another year, I want to learn how I can address these issues. Because they obviously don't respect us for work and effort we put in, confronting them is going to be a challenge. How can I give it to them?\nTL;DR:"}

The issue is, I am afraid of becoming attached to someone emotionally. I am afraid that while right now I am fine, I will find myself years down the road old and alone. I want to make a change now. \n\nI have put myself out there once. I had a girl that I was crazy for. Any day I spoke with her was a great day. We were friends. I felt more than that, she didnt. She turned me down. Things went down hill as they do when two people are looking for different things. I ended up cutting her out of my life. Since then, opening myself up has become impossible. \n\nRecently I dated a girl for two years. I couldnt open up. I couldnt allow myself to fall for her. I don't think she was the one, but the fact that I wasnt able to open up concerns me. It's like I tried to find any little thing to mistrust in her and then just shut down.\n\nI dont know what to do. It's been 10 years since I have spoken with the girl I was crazy about. I still think about her. I almost feel like trying to contact her to see if I still feel something and try that road again - if she would even talk to me as I just cut her out of my life. I do not know what to do or where I am going. \n\nIt's hard to even describe. I am not depressed. I just feel that I am going down a bad road and want to make a change. But the idea of opening up and becoming attached to someone is so draining to me. Even friends - if something came up tomorrow (IE a new job), I would have no trouble cutting ties and just leaving.\nTL;DR:"}

I have generally had a good relationship with my retired parents (in their late 60s). I almost never ask for anything because I do not like to be a burden. Still, my parents are fond of saying they will always be there for me whenever I need them.

They had booked a Carribbean vacation and did not want to cancel it. My father even stalled on giving me an answer until after the vacation cancellation deadline. Then he told me it would be too expensive to cancel after the deadline (This felt very manipulative). I know I am a grown-up, and plenty of people can't rely on their parents for anything...

We've been a couple since we were about 15 years old and have seldomly had rough patches in our relationship. \n\nSince a few months I've noticed that my feelings towards her have changed. Although it sounds clich\u00e9, the best way I could describe it right now is as if she were my best friend or even my sister, not my lover. We live in different cities and live very different lives at the moment; I'm pretty outgoing, like partying and love living the 'student life', whereas she's much more focused on her studies and rarely goes out at all.\n\nI know that I would live a really, really happy life if I would end up with her. Somehow I got the feeling that in the end we belong together, but I'm not sure if the relationship is working right now. When I told my gf about the way I felt she started crying and we agreed we would work on it together. It's been a few weeks since that moment and even though I know I can't force my feelings, I'm not feeling the same way about her as I used to.\n\nSince I've never had these doubts before, I guess I'm just wondering if any of you have gone through this same situation as I have and if you have any advice for me.

We worked together for some time and became friends. Eventually more than that. Soon afterwards she told me some heavy things. She has had problems with sexual and physical abuse in the past. She has some strong anxiety problems (probably stemming from the past but I'm no psychoanalyst). These manifest in occasional anxiety episodes and slightly manic behavior. I've managed to work through it and be supportive. After all, no one is perfect. She came into my life after a difficult time with another girl and she has been nothing but caring and supportive of me since. No jealousy, no drama. The problem now is that I know she cares so much for me and I don't think I can give it back. I'm worried about her mental health and I don't want to break her heart (Which is ironic because she swore she'd break mine when we first started). It doesn't help that it's her birthday tomorrow, the holidays are soon, and her parents are getting a divorce. I've been able to blame my increased distance between us on college finals and other stresses, and I know she's concerned about me. Another problem is our sex life. She's a bit more, ah, voracious than I am. I use to be able to keep up but I don't think I can keep at her pace. I don't see us lasting and I even went into the relationship knowing it would be temporary. What's worse is that I've been thinking about my ex a lot. We dating for a long time, moved across the country together, kind of broke up, and had an on and off relationship as we adjusted to our new lives as \"adults\". One day, the ex stopped talking to me. Months passed and then we ran into each on campus the other day. We're having coffee tomorrow (to catch up, we were good friends and I genuinely want to know how she's doing). I'm trying my best to not think too much on it and try to remember why we broke up but man, there are things I miss...\nTL;DR:"}

My GF claims they are mostly just jokes, I trust my GF, but he still makes me uneasy. \n\n-My GF has made it very clear to me that they are good friends and I shouldn't/can't change that.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: (16M) Unsure whether to pursue things with her (16F)\nPOST: I've been seeing this girl for about two months now and I'm looking to make things official. There's a few things that hold me back however. \n  The first thing is that her mom does not trust her at all, we can never be out of sight. This puts strain on us because it's keeps us from even talking about much due to the awkwardness of her mom or siblings listening. She isn't even allowed to come over my house and has to argue with her mom in order to go on a date with me in a public place. I know we are young, and her parents should be wary, but this is excessive and makes a relationship with her nearly impossible.\n   Another thing is that we don't go to the same school, but we live close to each other. This means I only see her on weekends which is only for a few hours. This may change when I start driving in a few weeks so I'm not too worried about that.\n   Despite all this, I really like this girl. We have a great time together when we can, and she feels the same about me. I really want a relationship with her but fear it won't work out unless things change. So, is it worth attempting? Or should I wait longer to see how things are then? How do I talk her about this stuff without upsetting her? Should I try to talk to her parents even?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: The Group Mind\nPOST: As a young male in his early 20's I have noticed something strange about the social hierarchies I encounter daily in a university environment. It seems as though people who are selfish tend to succeed socially better than others. But why do these people succeed in a group environment? I have thought about this a lot and it makes little to no sense. I keep my mouth shut, hardly ever talk about myself, never talk badly about people behind their back, support others in their dreams and aspirations, and yet I feel very lonely and have no friends. It seems as though people do not return the favor (which I am totally fine with btw). The part that bugs me is that people go on and on and on about their own lives, and seem to succeed socially, in a very dysfunctional type of way. I don't know if I'm in the wrong group environment or whatnot, but it's starting to frustrate me because I feel it is holding me back to some extent in bettering myself as a person. I'm waiting for others to take interest in me as I do them but it never happens. I mean, I understand I am going to fall behind in an economic sense if I hold strong morals and ethics, but socially? With women? Good friends? I keep asking the question to myself of whether or not it is beneficial to stay truthful and honest to others and myself. So my question is; do you think it pays off to be narsissistic and selfish? Judging by many examples and anecdotes from the real world, the answer would seem to be yes\nTL;DR:"}

Bye forever. She has tried to overdose on sleeping pills several times before, but only enough to put her out for a few hours. Each time (I believe) because of some petty argument with her parents. I had tried calling her house and relatives so that she could get to safety. When that failed, I called an ambulance to where she lived.

Like most post on this subreddit this did not happen today, but rather a week ago (technically this fuck up really dates back to the beginning of the school year but whatever.) So I was a junior in high school and I met this girl (we'll call her K). K is the whole package; she's smart, funny, quirky, and beautiful. We had four classes together and talked all the time and ended up becoming friends. In the beginning of the year she was into me but my brain went full retard and didn't pick up on the hints. She would always hint for me to ask her out by saying things like, \"I'm going to the movies this weekend but I'm gonna be all alone. I wish I had someone to go with me..\" She would also get really close to me too (I know reddit Im an idiot). Well long story short I ended up falling for this girl. Hard. I had spent the whole year trying to ask her out but, I am extremely shy with little to no confidence. I am the farthest thing from George Clooney and this girl was drop dead gorgeous and lightyears out of my league. Due to my stupidity I didn't ask her out and we got out of school. So far I had spent my summer texting K trying to yet again work up the confidence but when you have friends like mine who needs confidence? My friend added her on Facebook and told her, \"Hey did you know SkullCrusherAJ has been trying to ask you out for a month but couldn't find the confidence to do it?\" I didn't know he did this until a day later and I had been wondering why K suddenly stopped texting me and wouldn't respond to my messages. After finding out what had happened I sent her a text asking if we can talk. After no response I sent her the sappiest text confessing my feelings and that I had liked her for a while now. She hasn't responded to anything I've sent for the past week and I'm worried I've missed my chance and lost a good friend. Reddit I don't know what to do. I really like this girl and don't want to lose her.\nTL;DR:"}

Since we got together anytime she has had an issue with something I've done or not done, she thinks we need to hash it out. If she said I did something, I would agree, apologize and try to learn from it. This would piss her off because she wanted me to argue back, say what was on my mind, etc. Well we have been constantly fighting since January and I always argue back, defend myself, explain why I did what I did. Now she wants me to stop arguing, take responsibility when she lays a claim against me, and apologize. So I have tried that, but now she says my tone and facial expressions are wrong. \n\nShe says she is done fighting, she says if any of her friends told her they were in this situation then she would tell them to get out, but she won't break up. I don't want to break up because I do love her, and I don't want to throw away 8 years because of a 6 month rough patch. Plus I feel guilty because we are both in school, she has pretty hefty student loans (I have none) and years ago I asked her to move with me when I got my first masters that didn't go anywhere. \n\nI know I have made some pretty bad mistakes, I haven't been mindful enough a lot of the time.

She didn't get an apology though, instead, he took her in to his room, and r*a*p*e*d her. \n\n3 days later (2/10/16), she broke up with me, claiming she was feeling overwhelmed by everything that was happening in her life. She basically said she needed to get her life together before she could be in a relationship again. She said that she still wanted to hang out with me, and still wanted to be my friend. She said there was a chance that we would get back together in the future, but I feel that she only told me this in order to lighten the blow of the break up.

We met on Okc and talked for a few weeks before actually meeting. Everything was great, we texted literally all day long and we'd call each other every night and talk on the phone for hours. When we finally did meet everything went well. We hung out for hours and we were both sad when I had to leave.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks, he has spent the weekend with me twice now (we live nearly two hours apart) and when we are with each other things are fine. The problem is in between that. When we arent together he barely wants to talk and when he does he just seems distracted. He hasn't called me since before we met in person and when I call him it seem like he wants to just get off the phone. I'm still in college and work two jobs, he just graduated and has yet to find a job so I know it's not because he's too busy. \n\nIt seems like I care way more than he does about talking to him or seeing him. He hasn't even offered to come see me or invite me over. I'm always the one who tries to make plans with him. He didn't want to spend this weekend together and he just doesnt seem to miss me when we are apart. I told him that I feel like he doesn't really care anymore and he kind of just brushed it aside by saying he does and he's sorry he made me feel that way but nothing changed. It hurts because I like this guy a lot but if I'm in a relationship I want to feel like the person I'm with wants to be with me and cares about me.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. I don't want to keep bringing it up to him but I also don't want to get too involved and get hurt in the end. So Reddit, does it seem like he lost interest and I should just end things before I get even more attached or should I try talking to him again?\nTL;DR:"}

How can I do it right?\nPOST: So, as stated, I'm a female. I'm twenty two years old. This is a throw-away account, of course. My boyfriend and I had been talking about trying anal (I told him I didn't really have any reservations. I have lots of friends who love it, and you can't knock it until you've tried it, right?) He enjoys being penetrated, himself, and I hope to get more than a finger in there in the future, so I thought it would be the perfect bargaining chip if I let him in the backdoor. \n\nHere's the thing: ...I know we used the wrong lube. All we have is that warming KY jelly. I've used this on him, and he had no complaints. But when I tried to lube myself up with the stuff it burned like hell. ....Like...not in a pleasant melty way. Just...fucking....burning. But I continue, because I want to do this, and he's obviously hyped for it. We try for a good long time to get him in (because the lube burned, I didn't bother with much preparatory work...) but it just wasn't taking. Eventually, there's this sort of....silent pop. Like...all of the sudden he's through that first ring of muscle and I'm just like \"NOPE NOPE NOPE.\" and I push him back and out. Then I tell him not to touch me for a bit because I need to have a little cry. It was bad. ...Still can't quite sit comfortably today. That's how bad.\nTL;DR:"}

I finally found a great guy whom I love more than anything, but I'm afraid it's not going to last because of my low libido. It wasn't always this way - I used to be a huge nympho. Then I got put on a combination of medications, the end result of which is that my health is improving, but I have no sex drive. When our relationship started it wasn't as bad as it is now, but the doses got upped a few months ago. Sex has become a chore - a boring chore. I fake it for him, because I want to make him happy, but I can't fake the bondage he's into. I used to be just as into it, but now being tied up for an hour or more is just *boring* for me. I'd rather clean or wash dishes - something productive. I hate that things have come to this. We live together, so it's constantly an issue (he wants to play almost all the time). I don't know what to do. We've talked about it, and he says he understands, but then when he's horny and I'm not... he is very good at making me feel incredibly guilty. I'm at a loss. Anyone else out there managing a relationship in which one of you has a libido problem? How do you do it?\nTL;DR:"}

After these four months we got back together, and have been happy together for another year. \n\nHowever, last week we went to a play together, and I looked over her shoulder while she was looking through snapchat stories and I saw Trevor. I immediately confronted her about it, and she said she and him hadn't talked since they had dated and that he had only added her recently, and she added him back because she wanted to be nice (she had pretty much ghosted him when her and I got back together). This was still a red flag for me, especially since he was playing a part in the play we were seeing, although her saving grace here was that her sister was also in the play. \n\nAnyways, she asked me if it would make me happier if she deleted him, and I said yes, and she never did as far as I could tell. \n\nNow, it's fair to mention that she lives with her parents and her mom is schizophrenic, and she's always giving my gf a hard time, plus my gf is involved in several school organizations and 15 hours of coursework. So a lot of the time she's either stressed or emotionally drained. But whereas before she always sought solace with me, this week she's barely spoken to me, and I feel like it has more to do with me getting on to her about having Trevor on her snapchat than anything else.\n\nSo what do y'all think? I see Trevor pretty often around campus, so I want to talk to him directly about this, but I'm not sure I could control myself. Should I just give my gf space and see where it leads, or should I take matters into my own hands?\nTL;DR:"}

Husband and I have had a few fights about that and I was truly sorry I acted out of line. I've apologized to both husband and Diane. I haven't done anything like that in a while but husband won't forget or let me be alone with Jack when drinking. Which is fine, i have no problem with that, we always get together as a group anyway. I don't have a crush on Jack anymore (told my husband straight out I was crushing on Jack, and he confessed he finds Diane attractive as well-talk of a foursome has spiced things up between hubby and I, but it's only bedroom talk).\n\nSo, husband wasn't there to hear my little brain fart confession. I don't remember saying that at all. So then some time passes. It wasn't dismissed as drunken talk. On three or four separate occasions they have tried to tell my husband (only while drunk of course) but they wouldn't actually say anything except Diane would say something along the lines of \"honey, be a man and tell him\" and then wouldn't actually say it. This frustrated my husband to no end, and he concluded that it must be about me since i was never in the room when they did this. He's asked me several times about what they were trying to tell him but of course with no memory of it, I told him I didn't know what the deal was. \n\nWell it finally came out last night. I wasn't there. Now he's acting like I betrayed him and lied to him. He is very good friends with Jack and is at his apt right now. I don't know what to think or feel about this.\nTL;DR:"}

I've made it very clear I am unhappy with the arrangement, but he refuses any options to go stay on a friend's couch or at his parents'. Part of that is related to not wanting to ask favors and part of that is needing good internet to do the job he has now (telecommuting). He won't look for an apartment elsewhere either because he \"loves this location\". \n\nI have never lived with someone else before and, consequently, never needed to deal with this kind of predicament.

Now what is \"good\" is entirely dependent on content, context, timing, and the general mood of redditors. It's a fantastic way to get the most fresh and interesting content to the most people. But I have a question...\n\n**What good is it to permanently track karma?** I can't honestly think of a single useful thing it does. It's widely understood that karma doesn't reward you with anything, yet people still bicker about \"karma whoring\". It's a number that means nothing, and yet somehow means everything. It divides instead of bringing together. It's a paper-thin pulpit upon which people can exclaim their superiority.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nDo away with permanent tracking of karma. The main benefit being less blatant reposting of content for karma. Without concern for upvotes/downvotes, it will encourage an open dialogue. Admittedly people might be less incensed to post, but honestly if you decide to stop posting because your karma isn't tracked - then just shove off. We're better off without you.\nTL;DR:"}

So I've been just keeping an eye open for any other opportunities and it sounds like I have another company very much interested in me, calling twice for over the phone interviews and now they're correlating a time to set up an in person interview.

She and I are joking, laughing, and just really having a great time. There's some major natural attraction going on and both of us know it. \n\nCut to the end of the night, this girl and I joke how we need to be good wing-man/woman so that my friend and her friend can have some alone time. I walk her home and we start kissing on her apartment doorstep. Due to a hazy drinking recollections, I don't really know when it came up that she had a bf who was out of town this weekend. Normally, I would cut it right there and say that we shouldn't do anything (I hate even the idea of jeopardizing a long-term relationship) but in my drunken state I forged on trying to go upstairs with her. She was just as conflicted as I was and kept saying how attracted she was to me. Kissing turned to me slipping a hand up her dress and beneath her panties and she pressed into me further. Finally, she came back to more sobering senses and said how she shouldn't do this. I told her I just didn't know if I would ever see her again and she responded with saying \"why don't you just ask for my number?\". On that note I left and some more drunk texting ensued. \n\nToday I've been wanting to text her some sort of apology because I feel like I just kept making the moves (kissing, touching, etc) that made it harder and harder to say no. That said, she was clearly into it too.

Even those who have never left the country may have picked up on this by way of European travelers on holiday here.\n\nI have made these assertions both while traveling and coming in contact with people traveling here, but recently the work setting has heightened my awareness of the stark contrast in dress styles.  I work in a corporate environment where attire is to be business casual at a minimum.  This generally means slacks and button-down shirt for men and a similar level of dress for women.  If an important meeting is on the schedule, a tie or sportcoat is expected, and perhaps even a suit.\n\nThat said we have a good number of employees, managers, and directors 'on loan' to us from French affiliates.  Regardless of their rank, and absolutely without exception, the France-based employees come to work dressed to the nines daily.  Even the best-dressed US employees generally look like castaways by comparison.  I get the impression that the daily wardrobe value for some of the European counterparts in the office exceeds my weekly income.\n\nSo what is the cultural significance of dressing so well on a daily basis?  Do Europeans feel as though the clothes make the man/woman?  Do they take the dress for success mantra more seriously?  Is it simply the fact that they are more fashion forward?  Is the culture truly more formal?  I truly hope this thread does not turn into a *let's bash the American slobs* discussion, as I'm genuinely curious.\nTL;DR:"}

The problem is his wife is bat-shit crazy and will not let this go. If this was just workplace drama it would be one thing, but it gets a little more intense.

She blew him off and quit talking to him, apparently this set off his psycho-chip as well and he started texting my wife saying how he would die if he couldn't talk to her.

Now we get back to psycho-chick the CEO's wife. She has apparently been feeding psycho-dude's wife full of stories about my wife slept with half the office (not true) and how she was obviously flirting with psycho-dude in public.

My personality seems to be great for the most part.\n\nI also know I'm making the mistake for talking to women I work with, but I'm 21 years old and don't have many other ways to meet women. I go to a community college studying computer science so it's a total sausagefest. I don't have any friends to go out with (they all moved out of state or have kids now). I dated a girl I worked with a few years ago (at a different job) and it worked out great.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How does one bring up sex in a relationship when we haven't done it yet?\nPOST: 24M here, dating 25F for 3 months now. I've been in only one other relationship, back in college, and it was with a girl who was extremely sexual, and there was never much discussion of sex before it just happened (she said that she usually waits 3 months in a relationship...ended up waiting a week, and it was a regular thing after that until we broke up). \n\nIn the last six months or so, I've gone on multiple dates with three women (the others being 20F and 24F), and I'm now dating one of them exclusively, as I said before. Sex did not happen with any of the other girls (although I wasn't ever \"in a relationship\" with either of them), and has not yet happened with the current girlfriend. The first time I tried to escalate things with her, I got shot down. I tried rubbing her breast while we were making out, and she gently removed my hand and held it instead, and I haven't really tried anything since then. I don't know anything about her sexual history, if she has any, and I'm not sure how to bring it up as a topic. I like this girl, I find her extremely attractive, and I'd like to sex her up at some point, but I'm not sure how to bring it up as a topic of conversation so that I know what she likes, what her boundaries are, or if she's waiting until marriage or what-have-you. My brain is telling me that she's just taking it slow because we didn't even kiss until our third date, but I've also had the thought that I may have found someone who is even less sexually experienced than I am and she might be in the same boat about the sex talk. I'd like to be able to bring it up in a non-awkward way (if that's possible), but I want her to know that her company is important to me, and that I'm not only thinking about sexy time. So, Reddit, can you give me some advice on this?\nTL;DR:"}

Earlier this year, we bought a house and got engaged.  Things seemed to be going well.  We didn't fight often and got along and communicated well.  The physical aspect of our relationship was always very vanilla, but it was there, up until about a year ago.  I Would still put the effort it, and it would happen, but it became more of a chore.  Over the last few months, it now very rarely happens and he usually can't keep at it for more than about 5 minutes.  We've talked about it multiple times.  I've always been polite and kind.  At this point, I feel there is nothing more that I can do, and it's something he needs to figure out, which he has made zero effort to do.  To go along with this, I've started to realize that he's not very proactive about getting anything done or fixed and very rarely takes the initiative on anything.  I've started to feel more like his mother than his partner.  We've talked about all of this and about me being unhappy.  I can't say he's not trying to fix it (except the physical part, which he has made no effort on), but the effort seems lackluster at best.  I'm at a point where I'm unsure that I want to stay in the relationship, let alone get married.  I've been very upfront about that part, too.  The times that we have talked about potentially ending our relationship, he has said it would absolutely ruin him.  I asked if I was just supposed to be unhappy for the rest of my life.  He said no, but offered no alternatives.  I'm at a point now where I don't know if I'm being selfish by not wanting to wait it out to see if things change, or if I am allowed to be selfish and leave to make myself happy.  Any input is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, I need some advice about a situation at a public school.\nPOST: A little background first.  My girlfriend works for a public school in Texas.  She doesn't work for the school, but rather a non-profit organization that works with the school.  They provide services such as counseling and mentoring to the kids.  The school is in a poor section of town, and the class is comprised of kids who have either been held back, or are old for the grade.  The kids are 14-16.\n\nSo here is the situation.  She has seen some troubling things from one of the teachers she works with.  Nothing truly sinister, but some things that are inappropriate at best, illegal at worst.  They range from playing favorites to certain students (allowing them to do certain things, but not allowing other students), driving students to field trips in her own car (almost certainly without parental permission), and on one occasion, spanking a child while other children looked on.  This is just a small list of things, but there is probably no point in listing everything.  She is just a bad teacher who does very questionable things.\n\nHer attempts to get the principal involved haven't proved useful.  The teacher and the principal have a long-standing relationship, and no matter the offence, the principal blows her off and defends the teacher.  The principal has said that she thinks that the accusations are just my girlfriend being overly emotional, calling it \"retaliation\".  This isn't the first time she has addressed her concerns with the principal, but the principal denies that they ever spoke about it.  There is no official documentation, but my girlfriend has documented some of the situation in the files for her own work.  She has gone to her supervisor, who is also not affiliated with the school, but there isn't much she can do.  She is aware of my girlfriend's concerns, and understands her awkward position.\n\nThe situation is kind of no win at this point.  The principal has said that she might not want the services to continue next year, which would likely look bad on my girlfriend.  Of course she hates her not right now.\n\nAny advice, Reddit?  She has addressed concerns with her supervisor, with the teacher, with the principal, and is kind of out of ideas.\nTL;DR:"}

Should I keep wife's old car?\nPOST: We are a single (stable) income family.  Wife currently freelances but she is looking on-and-off for a 9-to-5.  Both current cars are paid off.  My wife's car is 9 years old, with about 140K miles on it.   The KBB value for a trade-in on her car is not very high, less than $1000.  \n\nThe reasons I don't want to part ways with the wife's car are two fold: One, I've dropped $2500 on repairs/maintenance in the last 2 years to keep it running.  (costs of maintaining the car still cheaper than buying something new-used) It's very, very basic transportation that currently runs well, but I have a feeling that a massive repair could be looming, one that'll offset what (if any) it's worth.   \n\nTwo, if my wife's job hunt puts her in a position for a 30+ mile commute, I'd rather her maximize the value out of her car before it finally gives up the ghost. \n\nMy insurance company has offered me a very fair deal to keep it garaged in the meanwhile. \n\nMy thought process was to keep the car for a year, paying minimum insurance on it and \"out of the way\" until my wife finds a job.  If the job search doesn't pan out or she finds something that is under 30 miles, she would use my old car as her daily driver.  I would then donate her old car to a local charity or vocational school.\nTL;DR:"}

One of them, who also happened to have a thick accent, came up with a funny word that made everyone laugh when he said it in a specific context. The running joke was funny to everyone for about two days, but he kept saying it the following days for about a week. To humor him, I was the only one who continued to laugh at the joke. Finally, after a week, someone in the group asked why I still laughed at it. I didn't want to hurt the guys feelings, so I came up with the first thing that came to mind other than just to humor him; his accent. He did not take it well; he started tearing up. Meanwhile, I'm feeling awful and everyone is now pissed at me. I figured telling the truth would just make matters worse, so I ended up sitting by myself for the lunch period after they told me to leave. I apologized the next day and still never told him the truth to this day.\n\nI later decided not to associate with that group any longer and hung out with a much more friendly bunch.

I love everything about him for the most part. One recent issue that could be trivial, is that he always keeps his phone on silent and doesn't check it that often. Sometimes he does and then other times a long time can go by before I hear back. This obviously makes it hard to get in touch. I can attest to the fact that this is just what hes like and he does this even when he's with me. The phone goes on silent, sometimes even in another room, he checks it very infrequently, and sometimes doesn't even bother to charge it if he's sleeping over.\n\nI mentioned it to him and he sort of laughed it off, not taking me seriously and didn't really say whether he would be more attentive to his phone when I made the request. He sort of dodged the matter. I didn't press too hard mainly because I don't want to make a big deal.\n\nFollowing that conversation, for a while it seemed like despite that he did not explicitly say he was going to be more attentive to messages, he was. However now he's gone home for the holidays to visit the family for two weeks and I'm already experiencing the lack of contact.\n\nI texted him to wish him a good day with his friends and its been 7 hours and I have not heard anything. I'm not looking for a lengthy response or frequent back and forth messaging just a simple message to say hello. \n\nLooking for advice particularly from the guys out there. Is it weird of me to expect him to text a few times even if hes busy? Is it normal for you to go a day or so not contacting your SO? I personally find it weird. I also have a bit of anxiety so I tend to sometimes overthink things. I acknowledge that about myself and am currently in process of scheduling a few sessions with a therapist to go over these issues and help me better manage my anxiety and have more confidence in my relationship. What are people's thoughts? I appreciate everyone's feedback :)\nTL;DR:"}

Well last night, I was working to close with the manager and my mom, who's kind of trying to make me look bad because I don't have my license, asked the manager to take me home. (It's a pretty small convenience store so there's no need for a lot of people on shift) Now I guess that's not too embarrassing since she has kids and kind of treats me like one.\n\nSo, around closing, like 11pm, she sent me outside to clean the parking lot but I realized I had already did it when I went out, so I went back in and she was in the office and I was going to tell her it was already clean and I saw her putting the money she counted in her purse, she saw me and started making excuses and I was going to say I don't really care, but she said, aren't I taking you home? And I just said yes, she said just ignore this and I got something for you. Now I'm 21, and she's 35 with kids so I expected her to maybe give me money or discuss how I want my days or a vacation.\n\nShe gave me a blowjob in the car. Never in my life have I even kissed a girl and she blew me till I came all over myself then she sucked it up. I can't really tell anyone else so sorry if that was tmi but never have I felt something so amazing before. But the problem is, now that she did that, I kind of want that again. But since she's like a mom that's 15 years older. How do I even ask for it? Or even get to sex?\n\nI also realized I have to work with her again soon and I'm kind of worried or wondering how should I talk to her after she did that? I mean, I'm not that talkative so wouldn't that urk her if I'm just myob, or lose my chance to make it happen again. So who knows how I should talk, any women here maybe?\nTL;DR:"}

I would always tell him he should break up with her but he says he doesn't want to make her upset and he wants to make her break up with him so he doesn't have to do it. \n\nSo one night I got really really drunk with my friends and I was texting and snap chatting Jacob. He knew I was drunk and kept sending pictures of him pulling down his shirt showing his nipple. I said he just wanted to see my boobs and he said yes. So I sent him a picture. He then told me that he would hook up with me if he wasn't dating Tracy. The next day he also told me that he masturbated to my picture. \n\nSo I was feeling guilty for a while and I asked my friends for advice and they told me I should tell Tracy because she is one of my good friends. So I told Jacob that I was going to tell her if he didn't so he texted her a message about what happened and told her I wasn't responsible because I was drunk but he was responsible. \n\nThey then broke up and she hates him and she just told me that I'm not a true friend and she can't be friends with me anymore.

I'm 16, as is she, so I know it's not imperative I find a woman or for this to absolutely go off without a hitch. I know there are other girls, this one just seems like she may be worthwhile.\n\nWe started talking several months ago, not very often, we had met at a concert and it turned out I knew her older sister. So I added her on Facebook and once in a while we'd talk on Facebook or something. Then, a bit more recently, I got her BBM and we started talking a lot on that, almost every day. It turns out we're very similar people, having some of the same fears, quirks, taste in music and a few other things. \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago my band was having their first show and I invited her, because I had started becoming more interested in her, and I could sort of play it off as a 'hey, come and support, it's our first gig!'. She came and after my set, we talked a bit and I thanked her for coming and that was that. \n\nNow to get to the actual date deal. After the show we started talking even moreso then we have and I finally decided to ask her to hang out, just us. We're not planning anything special, just a walk around the neighborhood, maybe go to a local park and just relax. My question is \"how do I make this go well?\" to put it simply.

So anyway, I've been talking to this girl (let's call her Michelle) for about a month or so now, and everything has been going pretty well. We've been going on dates frequently, we have no problens having conversations while we're out... but I don't trust her. I know I have trust issues of my own but I'm usually all for trusting someone until they give me a reason not to. Anyway on to the incident. \n\nSo when me and Michelle first started talking, she mentioned her ex boyfriend who was apparently a huge dick to her (emotionally and physically abusive she says). Anyway she spoke so low of him over the course of a week or so, of how much she hated him and never wanted to speak to him again. Well one day we were walking around in our downtown area after getting lunch and we pass by a store where she sees her ex in. Me, not really giving a fuck keep walking, but she says \"Oh, shit\" and walks faster. Well he comes out and calls her name and he hugs her (she doesn't really reciprocate) and we say an awkward hey and continue walking.\n\nWell he comes running back out and stops me, and says \"Hey man I just want to let you know, that a few days ago, she texted me and came over and we had sex.\" I tell him thanks for telling me and we go home not speaking. I decide to forgive her because we aren't dating officially and I know if a girl was wanting to have sex with me I would've done it, so I can't be a hypocrite.\n\nIt's not really the sex that bothers me, it's the lying that she hated him so much and still did it and in the time of us not texting or whatever, now all I can imagine is her doing the same thing again. She kept the ex thing hidden from me, so who's to say she won't do it again. I know she's young but I do want this to work but I feel like she would cheat on me in the future. So what should I do?

I am trying to learn what the difference is between these and all I can come up with is that I can contribute to the 457 now (pre 1 year) and the 401(a) I have to wait until I have been here for a year. The financial institute that my company uses is called ICMARC and I have been looking through the packets of options for investments in both the 401 and 457 and it seems like the expense ratios (which I barely understand) are very high. For example they have something similar to the Vanguard target funds except the are called Vantagepoint target funds and the Vantagepoint 2045 has an expense ratio of 0.94. I read a bit about expense ratios in the FAQ of this subreddit and it said something about wanting to stay under 0.2? Most of their expense ratios range between 0.6 and 1.2... what are my options?? \n\nI make about $44k gross, my wife make about the same. My company offers to match half of what I contribute plus an additional 8%. So if I contribute 6%, in actuality, 17% is being contributed.

Last night was my 21st birthday and unfortunately due to work commitments she couldn't come (she came up earlier instead when she could get time off of work).\n\nNow I'm not the biggest drinker, mainly because I don't enjoy the cost/aftermath.

Being my 21st though I had people buying me shots all night and ended up black-out drunk by the end of it, passing out after having my friend carry me back to my bed. \n\nThis morning I woke up and everything seemed fine (besides my headache). Later on though I was told that when I was drunk very late in the evening I kissed an old friend of mine who showed up by surprise to the party. I have absolutely no recollection of this at all and can't verify if I've done it or not myself so I'm going entirely off of what I've heard.

I love him to death.\nWhen we first took him, he was the sweetest dog to any humans that he would meet: us, our friends, waiters in coffee shops, strangers in the street. He didn't bark at all. For about two weeks upon adopting him, he was completely silent.\n\nAfter those first two weeks, he suddenly started barking. At first it was only occasionally. Now he barks at literally everyone who approaches him. 1 out of 10 times he doesn't bark if a stranger talks to him.\nWe can't have people over, we can't take him anywhere he would be around people. He even snaps at people.\nI can't put a muzzle on him because he bites me (a little, as a warning -- but I'm still afraid because he gets super anxious) when I try.\n\nI don't know what to do. Other than this complete intolerance of all but two humans, he is an amazing dog. He loves to play, cuddle, he is gentle with cats (we foster cats and he loves every single one we take in) and other dogs, he is very intelligent and easy to train. He knows the cue for both 'bark' and 'quiet,' but he ignores me when I tell him to stop barking at a person.\n\nWe hired a dog trainer and followed her advice closely, but it doesn't help. We tried Adaptil diffuser, Calmex, treats (treats help distract him from barking, but I as soon as I stop feeding him, he's barking again.)\n\nWe don't know anything about his past, but he clearly hasn't been socialized. I would love to take him to doggie school, but am afraid he would just bark at every other owner there.

Sometimes I see a facebook status or something I want to comment on, and it can be a girl I barely know, and my girlfriend will bring it up later and be kind of upset about it. She will say something like \"well you would get upset about it too\" but the thing is I really wouldn't get upset if she just replied to some guys status. Is this normal?\n\n How about if this situation is applied to an exgirlfriend? Today an exgirlfriend put up a status I found interesting and wanted to comment on it, but decided against it because I know if she sees it she is going to get upset. Should I post it anyways? Am I right to have not posted it? I am really not a jealous person and feel extremely secure that she is fully committed (seriously I doubt any other guy in the world could seduce her, she is so loyal) but if I saw her commenting on an exboyfriends status I might find it strange too. Is this wrong of me?\n\nI am fully committed to this girl, but sometimes I feel like I miss the freedom of not having to explain myself. I used to be way more spontaneous and hung out with friends a lot more. I am still 22 and it's kind of scary to be in such a fully committed relationship. I am not used to having to check in so much with someone. \n\nOnto the bonus questions:\nNow she wants to move in together and it scares me. We have been going together for one year, but what really scares me is being so committed. What if I just want to do my own thing? I am scared to be living with someone full time. I always have wanted to live alone at some point, She is graduated but I still have almost three years of college left. I think this might be the girl I marry, but I still want to enjoy some  freedom and individuality while I am young! How can I do this? Would it be possible to live together and still have my own space? What do you all think about this?\n\nThanks so much for reading!\nTL;DR:"}

From the second I turned out of his street to when I got to my workplace, there was a car in front of me following the exact same route.\n\nI thought it to be quite funny, so when I finally pulled into my work's car park I got out of my car and went to ask her if she noticed that we had followed the exact same route for the past hour, but she most definitely noticed. She turned the car around screeching and sped away, weaving through cars parked in the car park and out through the entry ramp, obviously that terrified she hadn't cared to notice. \n\nI was relaying this story to a friend who told me he once went to the chemist to get his girlfriend medicine. He then took the tram back to hers and got off the same stop as this girl. They ended up walking the same way home, cutting through the same streets and alleyways until he got to his girlfriend's street... where this girl turned out to live as well. In the same apartment building as his girlfriend. Apparently once they got to her street she began to run so once he reached the complex she was already running up the stairs and screamed at him IF YOU COME ANY CLOSER I'LL CALL THE POLICE! and hurried herself into her apartment. He has felt so guilty he's been waiting to run into her again to apologize as he thinks he may give her a heart attack if he knocks on her door.\nTL;DR:"}

Here is my situation lead to this.\n\n So I failed all my course last year, half of it is because of my stupid, unattended at my study. Also, in the exams that I took, I answered my exam in pencil, which what you weren't suppose to do. All of my exam worth 50% and more so I failed. \n The second half my year, I got a warning and I actually tried to study. However, I stayed in a shitty flat, half way through the semester, my flatmates got a job at night, which when they get back it would be 1-2 am. They would the play video games and make it quite loud until 4-5 am, this makes me unable to sleep very well (I'm a light sleeper), I tried to talk to them but they were assholes and I couldn't do anything. I couldn't move out of the flat because I was sharing a room with my bf, we couldn't find a flat that let couple in and there is a fine if we break the contract (500$ bonding and extra on top). My bf didn't want to move out either because it was close to his work\n\n I don't want to change the major because at the moment, I don't know what I want to do and other faculty does not interest me at all. Also, even though I failed, I still have a basic understanding of my major (Computer Science).\n\nBefore university, I had a pretty decent grade and even got a scholarship from them but since then I slipped.\nTL;DR:"}

Although it isn't a passion of mine I have stuck with it for the money and since it's fairly close to where I live (Walking distance).\n\nThis week, a bombshell was dropped. They are closing the office in my city and pretty much relocating people where they can elsewhere in the UK. There could be options for working from home and say a couple days a week in another office. But this for me would be an additional 2 hours (per way) journey to what I am currently doing. \n\nThe office isn't being closed straight away so I have until around the end of June. So I am thinking maybe this is an opportunity to knuckle down and maybe change my career path and get into something that interests me. my initial thoughts are to take up a programming language. What programming language I am not entirely sure of yet but I was drawn to C++ as a starting point. \n\nIt's only been a few days since the announcement, however I am finding it difficult to really concentrate I guess due to the shock of finding out that I could potentially be jobless within a couple of months. \n\nSo.....really what am I asking for? some advice, what precautionary steps should I take in the meantime and are there any tips or tricks in the last 10 years that may help me these days? Also, how easy would it be to learn a programming language and to get a job in that area? what sort of qualifications are deemed as necessary in this area?\n\nI guess I am babbling a little bit, but any advice in general about what to do would be helpful :)\nTL;DR:"}

Now, I'm not drowning in rolls, but I am very aware that I'm not in perfect shape and could stand to lose some weight. My genetics however have made that very hard with a slow metabolism and a genetic predisposition to absolutely LOVE food. Anyway, my boyfriend has told me multiple times that my weight is the reason he isn't as attracted to me. He doesn't want to have sex as often as I do and he says that if I lost weight he'd want to have sex with me more often. \nNow, he has DE which means he can't finish during sex because he's programmed himself to respond to a grip that's too tight and pace that's too fast. He's told me multiple times that he wants to fix it- the way to fix it is to stop masturbating and just have sex until eventually it all builds up and he's able to finish. This of course is hard, but many people suffering from DE do it. The first time he told me he would stop masturbating, he lied to me for weeks about it. The second time he said he was completely dedicated and even had me block the porn on his computer... except he then found he could watch it on his phone. \nWe had a huge argument about it where he basically told me to \"help him out\" by losing weight..and that if I was skinnier he would be able to not watch porn or masturbate and fix the DE. He's also told me that watching porn makes him objectify women and not appreciate real women for what they are. \n\nNow we have a deal that if I show \"true effort\" to lose weight.. he won't masturbate. \n\nI'm really hurt by everything he said even though I know he was just being honest, which is a good thing. I just don't know how to feel ok about the whole thing. He can't help what he's attracted to, but to me, when I've really cared about and loved people.. I was attracted to them for THEM, they could have been 500 pounds for all I cared..I thought that's how it's supposed to be.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel myself being constantly turned down lately, within the last 2 or 3 months.\n\nI am finding this to be a repeat thing in all of my relationships. Now at first, I assumed it was because after the first year, sex can lose its spark, but the few times here and there when sex did happen, it was as good as ever. It is only the infrequency that has me bothered...until a few nights ago.  Now, not only does my husband turn me down with a million excuses, but when he does \"give in\" as he puts it, it is mediocre at best.\n\nWe discussed this the other night, and I asked him why he is always rejecting me. His answer was that I am \"too easy\".  He claims to love the chase and when I just give it to him whenever he wants it, it turns him off. Is it possible that this has been the reason it has re-occured in my relationships? Are all men that way?\n\nBesides being a tad offended at the statement he made, I am being hit on on a constant  basis at work, and lately after months and months of no sex, I find myself wanting to stray.  If the tables were turned and he was not getting any from me, I would not be surprised to see him stray either over time.

We didn't contact each other for about 7 months until a month ago when we tried to make amends. This turned into us both admitting that we've missed each other a lot and we both still care about the other. We've hung out a few times since then and talked about how we still have these feelings and since then it seems our relationship with each other has simply reverted back to what it was when we were dating (in a good way). The problem is: I don't think it'll work in the long run. \n\nDrug abuse (on his side) was an issue with our former relationship and although it has gotten better, he still isn't where I'd hoped he'd be and I know you can't change people but my preference is simply different than his when it comes to drugs which, for now, is fine. But because of this I can't see a future with him. Aside from this, he's the one who broke up with me and because of that I don't completely trust him emotionally. Also my friends all hate him. \n\nI guess I just don't know if I should continue this pretend relationship we're having or tell him point blank that we have to stop because there's no future unless certain things change. I do love him though. Very much. So I really don't want to stop talking to him and acting the way we've been acting but I know that's selfish. Neither one of us has brought up the idea of us getting back together or turning this into an actual relationship so maybe he's feeling the same way I am and we're just both enjoying each others company while we can? Maybe this can just be a casual thing and not as serious as a real relationship?\n\nI'm just confused and unsure of where to go from here.

I know cheating was wrong but I feel Like he's asking a lot..at the same time though part of me is scared that I'll never find anybody else who will love me like he did...I want to stand on my own as a person and have someone stand by me, not over me.

Is this worth an argument?\nPOST: Background knowledge for you all- I am in a serious 2 year relationship with a man and we have been doing the long distance (300 miles) since we began dating. \n\nMy boyfriend attends physical therapy 3x weekly. He has a male physical therapist, and he has been going to him for about 10 months now and they have become somewhat friends. There is a female PT there too. Well, I noticed on twitter they were going back and forth with inside joke tweets, which, at first, irritated me a bit. I shared my thoughts and feelings about the issue, and he responded with some defensive comment, along the lines of \"Oh it's nothing. Relax\" and then tried to explain to me what he said meant. I have dropped it and that is that. I also forgot to mention my boyfriend is very personable and friendly. I don't think he has bad intentions but sometimes he comes off as flirtatious. I saw under his phone contacts her name listed. (I believe the female PT has a boyfriend as well). My question is, should I be mad? Should I bring up the issue? As I mentioned above, he is personable and very friendly. Does that still make it ok to get her number? My real question for him is WHY did he get it?? WHY did he need it? Should I tell him it's wrong or should I drop it and pretend I never saw it? I would appreciate advice from both males and females! Preferably if you are in a serious relationship as you may be able to relate a bit more :) THANK YOU!\nTL;DR:"}

I know I don't want kids right now (and neither does my wife). However, she has talked about starting to have kids in 3-5 years and I'm beginning to worry that I might not want kids on that time horizon.\n\nI guess I always assumed, naively, that I would hit an age and want a family.

I love what I do but move around) let alone 5. Does everyone know if they do or don't want kids by 30?\n\nAnyone else been in a similar situation? Obviously I don't want to have kids if I'm not ready, but I also don't want to rob my wife of 5 childbearing years waiting to see, and have it turn out I still don't in 5 years.\nTL;DR:"}

Actually, they're flying across the country, the 3 of them(son + BF's GP), to visit other family. I didn't want this to happen, but I also didn't want a fight.\n\n This isn't a rarity, either. His parents are always getting OUR son for special events and things; their excuse is that I work so much, should I really be monopolizing all my son's time when they(BF's GP) could spend all day with him? For example, thanksgiving, easter, etc. I really don't work all the time, but since I work retail(I'm still going to school, yeah, I took a break and started over, don't judge me), I have to be there for most holidays.\n\nAnyway, my BF says his parents need him to stay over at their house to dog sit for the week or two they're out of town. When I suggest kenneling, he says it's too expensive, despite his parents making plenty enough to afford it(I know his father makes >60k, mother 40k at least). So now not only do I not have my son for christmas, I don't have my bf either. I'll just be alone for 1-2 weeks during the holidays. Is it selfish of me to want my immediate family with me for christmas? Should I let it go? And I'm also kind of hurt that my BF doesn't even care about this. He doesn't care that his son will be thousands of miles away or that we'll be apart.\n\nI feel like maybe it would be nice to have some alone time, but not during the holidays. That just sucks.

Our relationship is adequate to good, but I'm beginning to become concerned that I don't feel my admiration (or love?) for her growing over time. I definitely like her. I like talking to her, hanging out, being around her, and such. However, its a feeling that I've more associated with an intense or close friendship rather than a relationship. \n\nIt may be irrelevant, but I'll mention it anyway. Neither of us is very experienced at dating. This is only my third relationship and the other two were relatively short lived. This is her first. Our relationship isn't very physical; we mostly stick to hugs, kisses, and the occasional making out. Its *nice*, but I'm not particularly excited about the lack of physical contact, but I understand her desire to take it slow with her first relationship and I'm willing to tolerate it for an indeterminate amount of time.\n\nIn closing, to the redditors that have more dating experience or who have been in a similar situation, is this a normal feeling? How long does it normally take to develop strong feelings for your SO? How do you know when your feeling of affection becomes love?\nTL;DR:"}

He tells me a little about them and it turns out he's a single dad, raising the kid by himself after mom past away somewhat recently. I could clearly see that it still really stung.  He tells me he sees so much of his wife in his daughter and then stops talking and changes the subject. I could see the tears welling up in his eyes even though he was trying to stay tough and keep a straight face.  \nAfter I pay him and he packs up my stuff I find out he's also recently out of a job, consequence of the economy going sour and no turn for the better in sight at the moment.

Upon further investigation, I found other patches behind my wardrobe and in other people's rooms.\n\nSince all the mould we found was on the inside of the same exterior wall, we assumed there was a damp problem and called our landlord. He was very helpful and offered to clean up all the mould we had found, but was reluctant to do anything beyond that.\n\nThe mould has gotten to a number of my books, I was able to salvage some, but others are covered and I can't keep them. A few are library books, some belong to friends and family, and others are very personal and hold a lot of sentimental value for me. If I bought them again, I'm looking at a cost of over \u00a3300. Since most of the books I need for uni, I absolutely need to replace them.\n\nMy contents insurance will not cover them, since they have decided it was due to negligence on my landlord's part (he has never had the house damp-proofed or even checked in 16 years) and therefore he should cover the cost. His insurance tells him that they won't cover it either, since they only insure the building. He has flat-out refused to pay out of his own pocket. Instead, he gives me a lecture about not storing books where they might be prone to mould. He never warned us about any mould issues with the house, and certainly no areas 'prone' to it, instead he assured us that the house was fully tested for things like that.\n\nSince he went to his insurance company, he has been ordered to damp-proof the house and there is someone coming on Monday to test the walls.

Unfortunately, there is a dark side to this love story, in that she is a recovering heroin addict.\n\nShe has been clean for the entire duration of our relationship, and didn't try to hide her past from me which I really respected, but the entire time I've had difficulty wrangling with it no matter how understanding I try to be.  This has all come to a head today.  She was fired from her job for unclear reasons (policy violation), but in response she broke down and went out to get a fix.  She ended up passing out from taking too much, and showed up at my place crying while I was working.  I did the best that I could to calm her down and to be as understanding and comforting as possible, but at this point I can't see myself continuing the relationship.\n\nI want to accept her for whatever her flaws may be, and I know all to well that I may never find someone who will accept me in the way she has.  However, it has become clearer and clearer that she requires me to be happy, whereas I still value my alone time, and her seeming dependency has started to become an enormous turn-off, so much so to the point that I don't find her attractive at all any more.  She smokes too much, she doesn't take care of her body at all, and all these little things are just starting to eat away at what I had thought to be a wonderful and healthy relationship.  I feel like walking away is the wrong choice, but at the same time I am really not sure how I could keep this going either.  I'm not expecting anyone to have the perfect solution to this, but just hearing other opinions would be nice in this instance.\nTL;DR:"}

That's what you want? Isn't it a little hypocrisy?     \nIf everyone had adblock, only gov sites and maybe few that get money from people would survive.  \n I'm fair (in my understanding of fairness). If adverts on page are too annoying, block my view etc. i just block them and don't give a fuck, it's two clicks on opera, other browsers probably have something similar. But why would i cut someone who is giving me something (free knowledge etc) while not disturbing me from surfing the web from their revenue?  \n Recently a lot of people whine about ads on youtube, i think they do it just because they are ads. When they are long you can skip them, so what's the problem. And i even watched few to the end because i was curious (they are not so dull as ads in tv, because, well, you can skip them).  \nI think, for some people sites should be totally free, without any ads with super fast load, full of unicorns and other rainbows. Unfortunately unicorns aren't so popular nowadays, because world doesn't work that way.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Fellow ladies of reddit, do you ever feel frustrated, or that your views are not considered fairly when they conflict with popular stereotypes and beliefs related to the perception of women and women's issues?\nPOST: It's incredibly disheartening for me when this happens, and I feel like it goes unnoticed, or unacknowledged for the most part. I'm not saying I'm always right, or express myself perfectly all the time, but I always **try** to understand where other people are coming from, and even more so when I am in a position when I am part of the group whose perspectives are more popularized by society. For example, and I know this might instantaneously make some people hate me based on the misconceptions of the label, but I consider myself a person that GENERALLY agrees with academic feminism. *However*, I put a sincere effort toward trying my best to communicate that I am sympathetic toward issues that effect men as well as those regarding women, and that I absolutely believe there are legitimate, unique difficulties men face, and that there are unfair expectations, and popular social practices that are disadvantageous to men, and should certainly be considered sexist and outdated (examples might include the idea that women and children's lives are more valuable than men's lives, or the unfair bias in favor of women in custody battles). \n\nAll I want is to be shown the same consideration I try to afford when I am in the position of power, so to speak. We can argue all day over whether or not, and to what extent that men have power and privilege in our society, but you cannot argue that there isn't a discrepancy of female perspective on a website that simply has less female members. It is not because I think men on reddit intentionally want their perspectives to dominate, or don't want to sympathize women's issues, but only the result of a disproportionately represented population. If reddit were made up of more women than men than the female perspective would probably overpower the male perspective, and there would be a bias in favor of women's perspectives. Men of reddit cannot control the fact that they outnumber women, and should not generally be blamed for this bias. I am only hoping that they acknowledge that it exists, and act accordingly. \n\nI know this won't be well received, but whatever.\nTL;DR:"}

I was going through a box of some of my boyfriend's electronic stuff (we haven't completely unpacked yet) looking for a specific charger when I spy a butt plug that appears to be used (it's not wrapped or in a box or anything).  Now I know it's not mine, as I do not own one, and a number of thoughts start to go through my head: is it his?  Does he even know about it?  Could it be from his previous relationship?  My mind is running like crazy, and obviously starts to spin toward the worst.  My bf is really big into ass-play with me, but he never lets me reciprocate to him.  He has suggested in the past that he plans on getting me my own plug for us to play with, but I can definitely tell this isn't some hidden gift that I accidentally came upon.\n\nSo now I'm debating whether or not to wait until he gets home from work to bring it up, or to ask him via text.  I decide to text him and just casually ask if he knows anything about it.  I instantly regret the decision.  I think I went about it the wrong way, I should've waited until he got home to ask.  But I was just so anxious and worried.  I sent him a text apologizing for asking via text, but I haven't gotten any responses yet.  This was about a half hour ago.  I can't exactly call him either, he works in a basement lab and can't really take phone calls.\n\nI'm just not really sure what to do now, how I should go about this before and after he gets home...\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I'm [20/F] unsure of how to approach this with my boyfriend [23/M]\nPOST: Boyfriend and I have been dating around a year. He's always been a pretty open when it comes to his phone until pretty recently. He'd leave it lying around, not always take it with him, but around two weeks ago he got pretty protective with it. Always in his sight or in his pocket, sleeps with it next to him, will occasionally turn away from me or go to a different room to use it.\n\nI'm pretty insecure and have some trust issues from being cheated on in my past two relationships. And with his acting so weird I started to get suspicious. So I snooped and read his messages.\n\nFor starters, he still regularly texts his ex who he said he wasn't really in contact with. There were also conversations with two girls I have never heard of, and considering we share the same friend group and I know pretty much all his friends, this strikes me as odd. He's super flirty in his texts, and talks about things they should do, what he'll take them. He'll ask for photos of them and then complement them on their looks. And there was one from this morning where he said \"good morning sunshine :)\"\n\nHe doesn't even say that to me. \n\nAnd I guess this is just kind of througout all of them, but he is *so* enthusiastic (not sure if this is the right word) when talking to these girls. Like when they don't respond or he wants to talk to them or something, it'll often be several messages from him for each time they respond. He just keeps trying even if they don't seem interested.\n\nNow I'm pretty darn certain there's no physical cheating going on considering the amount of time we spend together, but even so emotional cheating is so 200% not okay.\n\nI've had issues with him previously that I want to bring up with him that evoke the same feelings as finding these messages, but this has pushed me to need to talk to him about it. I don't know if I should bring up finding the messages to help make my point, but all I see happening is him turning this around into an invasion of his privacy.\nTL;DR:"}

But he wants me to move in with him and I'm not sure if its a good idea. We've been dating for about a year and a half. \n\nWe have VERY different political ideas. We can't talk politics because it pretty much always results in an argument/debate which neither of us enjoy. He is a political person and he wants to talk about politics but mostly just wants me to agree with him (too bad for him).\n\nHe seems to get a rush out of taking stuff. One time he tried to convince me to steal a beer mug from a restaurant for him and I refused and talked him out of it. Another time he told me the story of how he stole a jacket from a guy who was hosting a party when he was a teenager. He has told me stories where he stole from acquaintances in the past and always seems to find it funny...he promises me that he would never steal from me and he never has but it bothers me that he would steal in the first place.\n\nHe litters in public parks, parking lots, hiking trails- anywhere really. He knows I hate it because I've explicitly told him that I do. He doesn't do it as often in front of me but I still catch him littering and it's not going to change. He is a respectful person when it comes to me, servers, and my family, but he doesn't respect common spaces.\n\nSo do I listen to that quiet voice that says it's a bad idea or do I listen to my feelings?\nTL;DR:"}

My flatmate (Tom, there's 4 other people in this flat, we're all friends) dated Jill last year for around 6 months, with him ending the relationship (he may have cheated on her, I'm not sure, but he definitely ended it, not her). This was in September last year, so over 6 months ago. Tom's my friend, but we're not super close (we met through mutual friends of ours). I don't really want to lose him as a friend at this point, but if that's what it comes down to in the worst case then I could handle it. He's aware I've been out drinking and partying with Jill, and hasn't complained to me (or her, as far as I know). \n\nI really want to tell him I like her so that I'm not hiding anything from him, but I'm really concerned that he'll freak out. For what it's worth, his friends in the past have dated my exs (years ago though), and I never really had a problem with that.\n\nWhat should I do? I'm thinking I sit him down and just tell him straight to his face that I'm interested in her. I feel I should at least tell him before doing anything, but I'm not really seeking his approval.\nTL;DR:"}

I have had no contact with her since, however, I had been secretly texting my niece. I was very close with her growing up and see her as a sister. I have since decided that was a terrible idea and I haven't had any contact with my niece in about a month. Our mother on the other hand is in daily contact with my sister and her kids. I have told my mother that my sister is not invited to my wedding in March, but my mother is being very insistent that that doesn't mean my niece can't come, my mother is pushing for my niece to be a bridesmaid. \n\nI'm really torn, on one hand I really do want my niece to be there because we have been so close since she was born, on the other hand I feel like I can't have her there without my sister, my niece is still a minor. I'm sure my mother could convince my sister to let my niece come, but I'm just scared that my sister might try and show up herself or something. Should I invite the niece or not? If so, should I ask her to be a bridesmaid? What do I do if I start getting pressure from my mom to invite my sister?\nTL;DR:"}

Kinda. \n\nAnyways, I go to college out of state, and that state is where he lives. But I'm back home for the summer, so we're LDR-ing it unofficially because this is my first relationship and I have no freakin clue what the hell I'm doing and I don't want a full blown relationship to have the first 3 months be long distance. \n\nWe talk a lot, we skype, we call, we text, we snapchat, we write letters, we send each other packages... we literally do everything that I think is possible (except sexting and junk like that... I'm not comfortable with it because I'm inexperienced as all get out and wanna take things slowly)\n\nPOINT IS, I love him. I know it's early to say it now (maybe a little OAG? Idk...). But I wanna make him feel special. And I have no clue how! \nHe's a huge romantic, and so am I... so that's why we've done the letters and stuff. We're the type of ooey gooey people that everybody hates. \n\nI wanna get him something nice for my next package to him. But not too expensive, (college student...). Something romantic... surprising... you know. \n\nP.S. Neither one of our primary love languages is gifts (we're quality time and touch or acts of service) but... it's difficult to do from a distance. I just wanna make him feel loved but I can't touch him....\nTL;DR:"}

I am the male, I dont even know how to word this and im very scared. I was with this girl for 5 years. Something very early on along the lines of rape happened. i wont go into details about that. Regardless of the severity rape is rape and im still deeply hurt by it, i cant believe what ive done. anyway fast forward 5 years we were still together. I am not physically abusive so please dont assume thats why she stayed, i did not threaten her in any way about the issue. Things between us fell apart, fighting constantly normal relationship issues. And of course the thing i did that should have never happened. Shes still hurt by it and still loves me as i do her. I want to keep this short. She broke up with me and got with someone else. it has totally crushed me, while i deserve it. shes still in contact with me and wants to be with me. however shes still with this other guy and i dont know what to do. i keep getting the classic run around. Can a relationship even work after an event like that? what steps can i take to help her forgive me? And how can i forgive myself for it? i have nightmares almost everynight about it and i regret it fully.\nTL;DR:"}

I have conflicting feelings about everything. Some days I know I did the right thing, some days I feel like I should have stayed with him. Then, out of nowhere there is a little part inside of me that is like a wild animal.

Only been with my ex and gave him all my firsts. I'm quiet, I'm shy, I'm very awkward. Not a nun in training or anything, but I cherish my body and love the thought of giving it to a unselfish guy that will love me unconditionally for the rest of my life (im a bit of hopeless romantic).

It would have guaranteed me $200 a week just for giving tours. This may not sound like much but for a college student, it kinda feels like a big deal, especially since most other jobs are shitty and hard to come by. But this job, this job was destined for me. So I submitted an application as soon as I heard about it, sooner than anyone else. I went to the first interview and aced it. I went to the training sessions. I learned everything I could about the design and sustainable features of the building and volunteered six hours on a Friday night to help out for an inaugural event. I felt pretty confident about it, especially because I knew the Director personally and had worked hard to make good impressions with everyone. And then I scheduled a second interview for Tuesday morning and didn't show up because I forgot I had scheduled it and assumed the upcoming faculty lunch was the interview. Instead, I spent the day studying for an exam. I probably could have apologized and rescheduled but I didn't even remember what I'd forgotten until just now, when I received the politely-worded email of rejection.

We also have fur babies and a temporary roommate. Don't know if that's useful information, but it's a bit of background.\n\nSo for some reason I cannot get aroused. It's not that I'm not attracted to my boyfriend; I love him to death and could not imagine life without him. But no matter what he or I do, it doesn't work. I used to have a *very* active sex life. Before I met him I had muliple partners, and after we got together he was my only one, but we were having sex 3-5 times a day. Now it's maybe once every 2 weeks, and that's with generous lube because I'm as dry as the Sahara. I want to be close and intimiate with him, btu my body won't cooperate.\n\nAnd it's not him. He tries massages, romance, kinky stuff, etc., but nothing works. I don't even have the urge to masturbate anymore, because nothing arouses me. I've run out of ideas to try, and don't want to ruin our relationship because of it. He hasn't said that it's bothered him, and he wants to be my one and only, but I know it's not fair to him.

She asked me what my hours were and when I got off (pretty damn late I can tell you that). She asked me this twice and each time she sympathetically patted my arm. When I asked her about her schedule and whatnot she said that she's getting 4 days off to go to a con (she's going to be cosplaying) and lit up when we talked about it. This went on for a few minutes before we each went back to our stations. \n\nNot long after during her conversation with a coworker she asked me through the window if I thought she was cute (it was part of their conversation, not sure of the context) which I replied yes without hesitation. So at this point I figure that maybe I should ask her for her number or give her mine. I managed to catch her before she got off and asked if she wouldn't mind getting pictures from the con she's going to and sending them to me. She asks me to write down my number for her, which I did. \n\nAnd that's pretty much the entire amount of interaction we've had while I've worked there.

He says \"I just told her I think you were both right about somethings and wrong about others\".\n\nWe meet at a local pub we both used to frequent randomly 2 days later.  We end up hooking up.  Its great.  I leave for work the next morning.  We've spent every night together for the past week and its like we're back where we used to be, very passionate and intimate.  \n\nIs this just going to evaporate or wear off?   Will one of us suddenly be over that initial excitement and thrill of it and see the other person as that person they used to hate?\nTL;DR:"}

In the past we've not really spoken extensively, but that changed these last few days. We danced and laughed and smoke and drank together, all the typical free youth things, and then she was with me for the overwhelming atmosphere of the war graves.\n\nSince spending so much time with her I am at a real conflict in my head, I can't get these new feelings out, I have a girlfriend but I think I'm crushing hard and it just gets worse. I've been having cold sweats and have been feeling sick because I doubt my ability to be a good and loyal boyfriend anymore.

About this time things got weird. she seemed distant always at work and tired and never in the mood for anything. Eventually to compensate she wanted to start hanging out with friends. I had no problem with this I figured she just needed to blow off some steam. fast foward another three months I would rarely see her for what I called five minute days. Basicallly wake up, go to work, change and go out again. I also noticed she had been drinking when she went out. Of course all of this set off red flags, i'm not proud to admit I went through her phone a few times just to see what she was doing because she would blatenly not talk to me. Finally it just came to an end one night when feeling insecure I went to her phone and found she had been talking to a guy I had previously told her I did not want her talking to and it became to much and we ended it. Fast foward a week post-break up, I ended up running into one of our mutual friends. somewhere along the lines he mentioned he had turned her into a bit of a pot head... hold on... she told me she only did drugs once.... (she's also been popping adderal) so getting suspicious I asked straight foward had she ever cheated on me and he admitted she had let a guy eat her out once while high.... I lost it. All this shit suddendly came out, shes been abusing alcohol, using drugs, smoking and cheating... (I supected she had cheated more but only had proof for another instance) I immediately went to her facebook, closed it, drove to her fathers and let him know who she had become. One because I was pissed and two because despite it all I still love her and in my mind she needs help.... she's fucking her future up and a promissing career just to party...\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not at all experienced with relationships. In fact, this relationship is my first serious one ever, so I'm really having trouble figuring out if what I'm feeling is normal and sensible or not. I have no prior experience to use as a baseline for any of this. I'll just get into what's happening now I guess.\n\nFrom the start, this has felt like a very good relationship to me. She really seems to appreciate me and enjoy being around me, and I was not used to that. Even still, whenever I get to see her, I get the feeling that I could just walk around the park with her forever and I'd be happy with that. In person, she is very affectionate and fun and just pleasant to be around. \n\nThe issue is that when we're apart (which is pretty often because she lives half an hour away from me and neither of us has a car) I get so down on our relationship. I start to feel like she doesn't appreciate me nearly as much as I do her, and I get so worried that she's going to realize she could do better than me (which she could) and just leave me alone.\n\nIt probably doesn't help that when we're texting I'm always the one who has to start a conversation. She'll never text me unless I text her first, and pretty often it's her who ends the conversations too.\n\nAnother thing that's contributing to my worry is that a good portion of my friends who know her really dislike her. I think this comes from a big fight she had recently with one of her best friends that resulted in them cutting ties. Now the person she had a fight with is slowly becoming very friendly with some of my friends. It's not really affecting my friendships themselves, but I don't know whether or not to worry about what they say.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm afraid of talking to her about it because I said I'd take care of her until she got better, but I don't think that'll ever happen, or it'll take years just to see improvement. I feel like a lot of our time together is just me taking care of her, but if I ignore it in favor of doing fun stuff with her then it just means I'll have more to deal with later when I have to inevitably do it. I'm so scared if I say anything she'll be furious with me because she has no way of taking care of herself without my help\n\nmore and more I find myself making excuses not to go over to her place because I'm just seeing it as work sometimes... And just thinking like that makes me feel like a total asshole. I just wish she would show signs of improvement.

She was playing around with me and showed me her butt and I got really turned on.\n\nShortly thereafter she explains to me that she doesn't get turned on easily. We had a brief discussion about how just looking at me doesn't turn her on but she reassured me by the GODS I turn her on otherwise.\n\nI don't understand this. It is common to be turned on by the things I do and my personality rather than what I look like or how I dress? I almost always initiate and it usually takes quite a bit of \"convincing\" to get her turned on enough to have sex. I am having self-esteem issues related to this.\n\nWhat do women think/feel when their S/O is turned on and they aren't? I do little kisses and touches to try and get her going but after a short time of no response or having her politely tell me that she's not interested I respect that and give up. Would me trying to turn her on be a turn off? I feel needy and disgusting when I have to do this. I plan on discussing it with her but I was curious how other couples handle this.

So I'm 21[m] and she's 20. We had been dating for s little over 9 months which I know isn't that long. But I really loved her. She made me feel so good. Made me want to be better. Made me smile so easily. She was so fucking great. \nWell. Over Christmas break her friend from Canada came down  we live in Oregon. \nHe stayed with her for 4 days while I was out of town. During which time she basically disappeared, meaning she stopped texting me or having any contact what so ever. \nWhen she got back things were different. But she told me she didn't cheat on me and I beloved her. She told me things were different because she needed space. So I tried to give it to her. I tried to do everything I could to accommodate her and make things better again. I so desperately wanted to save our relationship. \nWell last night I finally snapped and read her messages while I was at her house and she was gone.  I found out she had sex with her friend 3 times during that period and then continued to be relationshippy with him there after. I asked her to just try to show me even a little affection but she could do it. And all these messages I read were everything I wanted. Complimenting him, saying how much she missed him, asking him to FaceTime. Just being everything I wanted her to be , but with him and not me. \nSo obviously we had to end. I gave all her shit back and broke some things and then we talked and needed up sleeping together again and talking a bunch about everything. But it didn't change anything. She loves him more. I didn't do anything wrong, she just loves him more. \nI don't even know how to deal with that at all. I just. If hurts so much. To see the woman you love so much be everything you ever wanted for another man. And then have to just walk away.\nTL;DR:"}

Let the game begin!\nPOST: Intro which is a must:\nBeen looking at this subreddit for a while now and finally have the courage to post so fuck it lets do this.\n\nBackground:\nIt's the year of 2010 and it's my first year of secondary school. We go and have our introductions to the classes and teachers etc.\nSo about halfway through I'm talking to the popular kids as I was coming in from a different school with primary extended for a year. One guy in particular is pretty nice so I get his MSN to hang out and stuff.\n\nA few months later...\nSo yeah he was friendly at first, but turned into a complete asshat from here on out he will be known as Assholio (Or AH for short). So the past few weeks he had been getting on my nerves by flicking my ear, purple nurples etc. So he decides to bend my wrist and punch it. Now i haven't mentioned this yet, but he's my size and a lot stronger. I've seen him beat up kids who punched him straight up in the face. Anyway I've decided I've had enough. Time to retaliate.\n\nThe Revenge: \nSo we have these tables during break and you just dump your bag wherever you want to. So AH abandons his bag as per usual and goes off to find a target. When I'm sure he isn't looking I pick up his bag and put it in some other group at the bottom of the mound. Now these piles were huge so if you didn't know if your bag was in those piles you would be absolutely clueless. So end of break and we all take our bags and go to class etc. I sometimes stayed to watch him get frustrated as the area emptied and he still can't find his bag. \n\nSome days I'd leave his bag alone as not to get him asking questions, because I'm a horrible liar. This continues on until I made the mistake of doing it once too many some months later. AH asks me if I was the one moving his bag around and I say \"Yes AH I was the one fucking with your bag you might wanna consider quitting bullying. It'll save you from a lot of detentions.\"\nHe hasn't bullied me or anyone else since.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest\nTITLE: IDK What I Feel...\nPOST: So a little backstory. I'm currently dating a girl, lets call her jo. I've known Jo since I was in 6th grade (about 11-12 years old) and we are similar, same taste in music, play a lot of video games, both hockey players. So last summer when we were 17 we started dating, it started really rough and a friend of mine introduced me to her friend, lets call her mary. So mary and I hit it off instantly and became really great friends, and kinda got a crush at the same time. So back to Jo, as I said things were tough, shes really shy and we had some issues. So I broke it off with her and went on a date with mary. Sadly it was just one date, her parents said she couldnt date me. So I got back with jo, who said she loved me and really wanted me back. \n\nBut as time progresses my relationship with Jo seems to strain, the number of good times we have seem outweighed by the times shes annoyed and angry with me. All this time however I've maintained contact with Mary and we remain great friends. I love talking to her and still think shes amazing (and we both still wish that one date was a longer string). So now I am conflicted I don't know who I care about anymore, cuz I struggle with my own issues, Jo adds stress to my life, but I still like her, shes cool.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore and I hate it.\nTL;DR:"}

I started running halfway through May, running one mile a day. Week two, I bumped it up to two miles a day six times a week. From there I bumped it up another 5-6 miles a week (one - two miles a day). I made it to 5 miles a day (30 miles a week) averaging 8.6 min a mile at the halfway point of June (one month in). While I was running, I was wearing shoes that were not made for running and provided no foot support. While running a week and a half ago, I got one mile in and I felt a sudden sharp pain in my top of foot / outside ankle. I stopped and took 4 days off. I ran again (carefully) the following week. I, again, got one mile in and this pain came back but worse. I knew immediately something was wrong. I stopped and went home pissed because I had lost weight and made great improvements in running. It has been 7 days since my last run and my foot and ankle are still swollen, and are still very restricted with any type of movement. I still can not put all of my weight on it and I can not move it without pain. Going to the doctor this week, but as of right now with talking to my doctor, the more than likely diagnosis is a stress fracture. Obviously, nothing is for sure until I come in. No matter what, I am out for a few weeks (at least with running / walking).\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: How do I tell my vet her advice resulted in my dogs death?\nPOST: My dog, Max, had epilepsy for several years, but it was very well controlled with medication. I moved across the country with him and obviously needed a new vet.  The new vet tested his blood levels for the medication.  It was below therapeutic levels, so she said we could up his meds or we could take him off of them, since he hadn't had a seizure in over a year.  She said it wasn't necessary, but advised that we taper him off his meds, just to be safe.  I agreed because I so wanted to believe he was better.  The taper was supposed to last a few weeks.  A little over a week into it I awoke to Max having a seizure.  I was sad that he wasn't going to be able to go off his meds, but wasn't immediately worried.  His seizures tended to last only a minute or two.  After five minutes I started to really worry.  After 10, I began to frantically look up nearby emergency vet numbers.  Around 15-20 minutes into the seizure, while on the phone with the emergency vet, it finally stopped.  I was relieved until I realized he wasn't breathing.  I frantically tried to find a pulse to no avail.  I ended up carrying Max (who weighed well over half what I do) down to a cab and to the emergency vet.  When they told me he was gone I had expected the answer, but I was still devastated to know my boy was gone so many years sooner than I expected.  A couple months later, I know I need to inform the vet what happened.  I don't believe she made the recommendation out of malice, or completely blame her for the outcome.  It is important that she know the outcome so that she can learn from it.  Even if Max's case was wildly outside of expected scenarios, I would hope that the vet would learn to know to warn people of this risk.  How do I present this in a way that will come off as an informative cautionary tale and not me blaming her for an outcome she didn't anticipate?\nTL;DR:"}

This argument caused a shit ton of hostility between the two of them, and now they fight at least once a week, through text, mind you, because Michael lives about an hour away and texting is their main source of communication. Michael sends pages of angry ranting to Robert when they're fighting and Robert has just gotten to the point where he hates fighting back with any reasoning (because Michael never tries to see his side) so he's resorted to short, sarcastic, and sometimes hurtful remarks just to fuck with Michael. From my perspective, they both have become so apathetic to each other's feelings but neither wants to reason with each other or even break up.\n\nSo now Michael has recently texted me to ask help him plan a surprise party for Robert. Robert has talked about his birthday (which was 6 months ago and before they started dating) not being as great because he had to buy all the alcohol for his party and \"no one\" got him a gift (except for me). So Michael wants to plan a make up birthday party that also will make up for their fighting. I'm all fine for parties and everything but Michael also wants us to put together money to buy a certificate for a tattoo Robert has been wanting to get. I don't know if I should try to discuss with one of them about how this isn't a good idea or just let Michael surprise Robert to try to make up for a relationship that probably isn't going anywhere.\nTL;DR:"}

I tried to do at-home therapy for it.\n\nOver time he became much less intimate and would often hurt my feelings with his sarcastic humor, all of which he blamed on sex. He even became rather depressed and mostly just slept. But I was still in love with him.\n\nI moved 2 hrs away to go to school, and still saw him almost every weekend, but he broke up with me over the distance + sex issue. He said he just couldn't couldn't wait anymore for sex and that was the main problem.

She wants me to come to her birthday dinner, and her boyfriend [50/M] will be there. [I am 24/F]\nPOST: **Background**\n\nI recently found out that my mothers boyfriend of 2 years has become increasingly abusive towards her.  It is mostly emotional abuse, but has escalated to physical abuse on at least one occasion.\n\nWhen I found out, I connected her with the domestic abuse hotline, and she has worked really hard to regain a sense of worth and power in the relationship.  She says that there have been no episodes since, and I believe her.  I have spoken with the counselors on this hotline about the role I should play, and they told me that the most important thing to do is make sure that she knows I'm there for her and let her make her own decisions.  (Note: I'm not here for advice on this situation.)\n\n**Problem**\n\nHer birthday is this week, and my grandfather (who also knows about the circumstances) is organizing a birthday dinner for her.  It will be him, his wife, my mom, her boyfriend, and me.  Up until now I have managed to avoid seeing the boyfriend at all.  He knows that I am not happy with him, and my mom says he is \"afraid\" of my judgment (that's rich, isn't it?).  \n\nI REALLY do not want to have to spend a meal with this person.  In my mind, the more separate I can be from him the better.  I *want* him to be afraid of me, and if I go to this dinner I will have to be pleasant which I worry will lull him into a false sense of security.\n\nHow can I approach this situation without making my mom feel torn between me and him?  Should I just suck it up and go?  The most important thing to me is that she understands that I support her.  I can handle a meal with him if it means it is the best decision for her.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [20 M] almost a year, not sure if this is the end\nPOST: First off, I love my boyfriend so much. So unbelievably much. I don't consider a year to be very long, at least not THAT long, but in that time, I've determined that I could be with this guy for a VERY long time. Marriage, I don't know, because we're both 20, so that's a while away. But I love him in that inexplicably way when you just kind of know, and if I did explain, it would get long and sappy.\n\nAnyway, even with all of that I have recurring desires to be single and with other people. Very recently, there is one guy I've been thinking about, but I think that's more about me projecting these thoughts onto him. I haven't spent much time on my own in general. 2 1/2 year relationship starting at 15. Ended when I started college, not long after was kind of with someone until I was officially with him. Now beginning sophomore year of college I'm single for the first time. I enjoyed it, I was finally my own person and not defined by another. I had people I had feelings for and it didn't work. Then I started dating my current boyfriend second semester of that same year.\n\nI'm worried that this just is not going to work. I don't know if I am just incapable of being with someone (I had similar thoughts with my first relationship though not as serious) or maybe I need to be single for a longer period of time. Is this just not the right relationship? Should I just try to focus on my boyfriend and block out the distractions? Maybe I need a break to sort myself out and revisit the relationship? Although, I don't know if he would go for that.\n\nI am so confused. I love him so much, but I don't want to be with him years later, possibly living together or getting married and having these regrets about not being on my own and spend the rest of my relationship with doubts and realizing I made a mistake. I also don't want to look back and think that being single wasn't worth it and I let go someone special.\nTL;DR:"}

Some background: I am 14, she is 16, for separate reasons, however, we had/have similar classes, are both fairly intelligent i.e. possible valedictorians, have similar interests, BUT i live in an essentially no-dating household and the majority of a possible relationship would be restricted to school and after-school events. I honestly have no idea how relationships work in high school. Now: I have never considered developing a relationship with her, ever. My question is what should i do now: Unlike last year when I first met her, during the summer she strangely kept regular contact with me, when the year began she sent me yet another out-of-character text addressing me as \"my love\" and has persistently tried to keep as much contact with me as possible often waiting for me to leave class, pulling my backpack to exchange greetings, etc. I dont want to make these gestures any larger than they are but I have no scale to gauge these things to.

The relationship started out amazing, I am a really shy guy and had not been dating for 5 years prior, but I was encouraged by some friends to ask this girl out. Turns out we had a lot of the same interests, were both huge geeks at heart. \nWhen things got hot and heavy we moved mountains, the frequency and quality of sex was mind blowing. This lasted up until December, then she started avoiding physical contact, I didn't think much of it until just recently. Since January she has been very busy with school and work, I only get to see her maybe once a week, we talk every day but when I finally do see her, nothing much happens, maybe have dinner, talk some, but she has gone cold to any physical advances.\nThe other day I was saying how things have been a little cold compared to the norm, she acknowledged this and then threw herself at me. Not in a good way though, it seemed like she was doing it just for me. I could tell that she was faking the whole thing and had to put the brakes on it. All of this has made me very depressed, what have I done to destroy the spark? She claims it is school and her busy schedule, and things will be normal in a few months. But there are days where she comes to me all happy and full of energy, only to shut me down after I receive mixed signals.\nI really do not want to be the boyfriend who only wants sex, but that is what it is starting to feel like. I could never do anything with her while I feel she is putting on a show just to make me happy. I am afraid I am losing her to career/school life. I am really torn, I do not want to feel bad for our sex life coming to a screeching halt, but I do. I still love her for who she is, but as the months go by with no physical validation of attraction I feel worse and worse.\nTL;DR:"}

For the sake of this post let's say I went from Mildred Rose Lastname to Rose Mildred Lastname. \n\nI had been planning and talking about making this change for over a year before I did it as I was not fond of my first name and I wanted to distance myself from the person I was through highschool. My teenage years were very difficult for me (mental health issues, substance abuse as so on) and I saw graduation and going to university in a different province as my chance to start over all topped off with a new name to feel like a new me.\n\nMy parents (now 52/F and 62/M) were fine with the idea of changing my name and the only resistance was that as I'm only child and mom didn't want me to drop the name Mildred completely so I compromised and kept it in as a middle name instead.\n\nThe few friends I had from high school did very well adjusting to calling me Rose as well as most of the extended family but my folks (more so my mom) didn't even try. It wasn't until last year that they even started introducing me to new people as Rose, and even that is not consistent. \n\nNow, my folks are amazing parents besides that. They are not narcissistic and have been very supportive and loving of me for my whole life except for my name. **It's been 10 years!** It's embarrassing to explain to people who've only ever known me as Rose why my parents call me Mildred, which inevitably leads to questions about why I would change my name and I'd really rather not get into my past with people who don't need to know it. I've tried explaining my feelings to them many, many times but no go. After this long I find it disrespectful that they won't try not to mention it hurts me.\n\nI understand they have a sentimental attachment to Mildred, but doesn't a Rose by any other name smell as sweet?

So, I pull up so close to the driver's side door that it's impossible to get in from that side. I get out of my car and start cutting the rope off my mattress, and the owner of the car comes down to leave, just standing there watching. I say, \"oh, is this your car? I'll move mine in just a few minutes, I gotta move this mattress. Oh, by the way, you're definitely not allowed to park here. Its a reserved spot for my apartment.\" and his response was \"I wasn't staying long\". I told him that he seriously can't ever park there again and that again, I'd move my car in just a couple minutes. He realizes I am not moving for him and he finally gets in on the passenger's side and slowly drives away. \n\nI am so sick of these assholes who continue to park in my spot.

She told me this in early April.  \n\nSince then, I have tried my best to help her through this.  We have considered abortion (women under 18 can receive a judicial bypass in the state we live in), adoption and seemingly everything in between but nothing has really happened because she is unsure of what she wants, so she is still pregnant.

I am one that needs to be active, and moving around, not stuck answering phones in a cubicle and occasionally making service calls. This is not only because I enjoy being active but because I have arthritis and sitting too long takes its toll. While the job pays well, and has opportunities for advancement, I have this gut feeling that I should leave and do something I enjoy for the time being, despite the possibility of recieving less benefits and pay.

I have the sex drive of a 15 year old boy who just discovered porn, and so did he, for the first year-ish. Once we moved in together 10 months ago, his sex drive slowly dwindled, or so I thought.\n\nI felt neglected and unloved, because he was fully aware that mine was still high and did nothing about it. Not to mention he was treating me like a buddy that he didn't care about. No more sweetness from him! Well, I found out he still had his sex drive, he was just watching a lot of porn.\n\nI never cared about porn before, until it affected my relationship. I asked him to stop, and BAM sex life came back, super sweet, etc. I've caught him a few times slip up, and I know when he does because he stops wanting sex. But now he's treating sex like a chore, and is detatched.\n\nI eat healthy, exercise, dress cute, care about my hair/makeup etc. And he is balding early, has a beer belly, and thinks the best way to spend a friday night is eating doritos in front of the tv, not moving an inch. He used to call us beauty and the beast. I don't understand why he can get so bored with someone that is above his physical level of attractiveness!? I try anything in the bed, dress up, etc. But I'm still just boring. I'm terrified he'll get so bored he'll be lead to cheating someday.\n\nIs this normal for a guy to feel? Am I settling for a man who won't sexually satisfy me? It's only 3 years out of what I hope to be a lifetime together.\nTL;DR:"}

We have differing views on whether or not cohabitation will ruin marriage in the future.\nPOST: So my girlfriend is going to start her first year of college and is required to live in a dorm for her freshmen year. We have been discussing the possibility of getting a place together in May, which would be the end of her freshmen year. We both agreed that we wanted to move in together and since we will have been together for over a year at that time, it would be a great next step in our relationship.\n\n A few weeks into our on-going discussion on the topic she mentioned that she had been reading up on the pro's and con's of cohabitation. The only con we seem to have a problem with is the chance that it could give us nothing to look forward to if we decide to get married. She holds the opinion that if we were to live together and experience what it is like to live together day in and day out, that it would give us nothing to look forward to in marriage. I don't share this opinion. \n\n My question is, does anyone have experience with this? Does living together give us nothing to look forward to when we get married, why or why not? My opinion is subject to change, i just want feed back on people who have already experienced this. I don't know what to tell her other than \"I don't think it will\".

I was really excited right up to the point where he says: my housemate is moving out in a few weeks, maybe you could come move in?

We have lived together for abouuuut 3 or 4.\n\nOn the surface, our relationship seems pretty good! We are A LOT alike. We agree on just about everything socially and politically. We have the same interests in shows, movies, and music. He's funny, and we usually get along pretty great and have fun. But I have a few problems.\n\nI am no longer attracted to him, and he has admitted he's not really sexually attracted to me anymore either. He thinks if we were more sexually active, our attraction could be re-ignited, but I'm doubtful.\n\nWe also have been getting into really weird arguments lately. Things that start off really small and somehow explode into large fights about how, \"you can never admit you're wrong!\" \"You have too much pride!\" \"You're just too selfish!\" Etc. When he's mad, he tends to turn into a jerk too, be insulting, things like that...\n\nThere's also the little problem of ...if we were to break up, I would have to quit college, move back in with my parents 270 miles away, and probably lose contact with all my friends (I have a veryyy low-paying job, and wouldn't be able to afford an apartment on my own, and I don't have close enough friends I could stay with near me/near my school.)\n\nSo, what do you think Reddit? Am I expecting too much from him, being too critical, hoping for someone 'perfect' which doesn't exist? Or does it sound like something is wrong here? Should we even be in a relationship if we're not sexually attracted anymore? Can that be fixed, or should we just split up?\nTL;DR:"}

It happened suddenly in a marriage that both of us thought was healthy. While I remember the process of him leaving being the worst weeks of my life, I went to therapy and I deal well with my father, even to the point of joking about it with mom.\n\nVery recently (little less than a year ago) I started dating my boyfriend. I couldn't be happier and I often think about how lucky I am. However, I have intrusive thoughts about him cheating on a daily basis, especially when I do not feel secure about my attractiveness. I have heard this is common, but last night it went to shit.\n\nWe were texting and somebody on social media had made a joke essentially saying that men cheat when women aren't attractive enough. He thought this was funny, I did not. Usually I deal with these situations alright, but him pressing and defending the joke and getting mad at me reminded me of these fears regarding him, resulting in hours of on-and-off panic attacks. I have not spoken to him since. I do not want to talk about the panic attacks, because he will (as usual) brush them off as me overreacting. He knows what happened with my parents but has said it's \"not a big deal.\"\n\nI need to know how to deal with this. I've had enough panic attacks about infidelity, but this instance reminded me of how much stress it puts on the relationship. Everything he says I search for things that indicate he would cheat and I'm beginning to think I should break up with him because I can't take it anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

I am 26 y/o and decided to go to college three years ago. I know I was a little late to the show, but I was motivated at the time. I majored in criminal justice and have one semester of classes left. I have wanted to be a cop for quite some time.\n\nNow to the issue: Being a \"non-traditional\" student living in the dorms, I found that making friends my age would be difficult. I started hanging out with a lot of the younger crowd. I was drug free most of my life, with the exception of a little pot here and there in high school. Maybe three times in total. I got drunk at school about three weeks ago and found out the next day that I was the \"life of the party.\" As it turns out I was told I was doing cocaine as well as extacy. This completly kills my chances of being a police officer. I have no idea what I want to do with my life anymore. The only job that seemed to fit me was that of a cop. Changing my major is not an option as I cannot afford anymore school. So, are there any suggestions for someone about to recieve a criminal justice degree later in life than most?\nTL;DR:"}

Since she has lived in his house (rent free) for over a year, does he have to give her a certain amount of time to vacate or any sort of official eviction? He owns the house 100%, all paid off.  \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis seems to be the only solution.  She doesn't want to give up this free ride. She basically just sits at home and leeches off of him.

I started counting calories for real, which led me to eating more protein and veggies and staying away from carbs. Nothing is really off limits, but I watch my portion sizes, and if I want to eat something \"bad\" I save up my calories through out the day. This way, I get to have a \"cheat day\" while still staying under my limit. And, most importantly: I'm not on a diet, I've just changed the way I eat.\n\nThe result? I lost 4.5 kg in five weeks and today I get to update my flair to \"-10 lbs\". I feel happy, and hopeful. I realised I can do this, even though it is hard.\nTL;DR:"}

After that she asked me if i want to date her or just sleep with her, because she is not the type of girl that sleeps with anybody and stuff like that... I told her that i want to date her and that i already know she wants relationship and not just sex, because of the things she was telling me when we go out.\n\nThis maybe doesn't sound too bad but i was going out with some girl that was always telling me i date her just because of sex and that didn't last for long, so this remind me of her. I like this girl that I'm dating now i don't want it to end fast.\nI don't think she will break up with me because of that, we didn't saw each other since we talked about it because she is working but she texted me and we talk like usual, I'm not sure if anything is changed, and i will see her on Monday.\n\nDid i started talking about sex too soon ?

He was obviously a lot older than me. We started dating when I was 18, right before I turned 19. We worked together, and once I graduated high school we had sex about two weeks after. At the time it was so forbidden and interesting. I was head over heels for him. I went away to school and he would come visit me and we would stay in hotels and have romantic weekends. I knew he was way too old for me, but he would always say things like how mature I was. \n\nI know that he did really love me, and I'm not going to say I didn't love him. I stopped feeling the same way about him, and decided it was time to the end the relationship. This was a very hard decision for me, but I knew I couldn't stay with him. I thought he was going to be my forever.\n\nNow that the relationship is over, I am feeling really gross and guilty.  know that sounds dramatic, but it is true. I feel like such a moron that I dated someone so much older for such a long time. I used to defend his temper, the way he used to treat me all the time. Now that I am out of the relationship, I am clearly seeing how terribly he treated me. Realizing this, I feel so so stupid and duped. I'm afraid about telling future boyfriends about this relationship, and I'm even more embarrassed that my family had to watch me date him for so long.\n\nHas anybody else gotten out of a relationship with an older man and also felt so creepy about it?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Dear Reddit, I'm a decade-long illegal immigrant seeking advice.\nPOST: I'm a long-time lurker, and this is my first post. Here's my story: I was born in Taiwan and legally came to California on a visitor visa with my family when I was only 3. While we were here, my parents decided to raise me in the US because they believed there were more opportunities for me, in terms of school and work. I began taking classes in a public school when I was 5. Sometime during elementary school, the visa was on the brink of expiring, so I was sent to Mexico to register for a student visa. \n\nOnce I returned, everything was fine and dandy until a few years later when some legislation passed (I don't remember exactly what year it was) that forced my student visa to black out unless I attended a private school. My parents didn't have enough money to send me to one, so they kept me in a public school and decided that I can return to Taiwan when I graduate high school. This is when I officially became an illegal immigrant. \n\nFast forward to Sophomore year of high school, when I asked my parents about going abroad for a high school trip. I was shocked to find out I was an illegal immigrant. I was very na\u00efve back then, so I didn't think much of it. Luckily for me, the AB 540 law was available for me to continue to college. I am now a 22 year old college graduate, unable to get a job, and unable to get a driver's license. \n\nI now have a tough decision to make. I can (1) return to a country where I can barely communicate with anyone who has greater than a kindergarten level vocabulary, (2) marry a US citizen and naturalize, or (3) hope for the Dream Act to pass. I want to stay in the US, but I feel like I'm wasting my time here if (2) or (3) doesn't happen within the next few years. Do I have any other options? I'd like to find a pro bono lawyer to give me advice if at all possible, but I don't know where I can find one. Hence, I'm asking Reddit.\nTL;DR:"}

We had our first baby three months ago and in general, we're very happy. However, recently I've been feeling inadequate.\n\nI'm not a particularly confident person, but I'm also not all that tough on myself apart from the last couple of months. \n\nI've always thought he was the better looking one in the relationship anyway but all of a sudden I just don't feel good enough for him. Part of it is physical, I don't think I'm that attractive but I can get over that. My body isn't great after having a child three months ago but I'm working on that. \n\nThe main issue is the psychological side of it. I know that rationally, there's no reason for me to feel like this and I'm not sure what's triggered it but it's always there at the back of my mind. \n\nWe have a good sex life (although it's me who initiates it a lot of the time) but because of how I've been feeling it's kind of been putting a dampener on the experience. In the moment it's great, and then afterwards the feelings of inadequacy hit me.\n\n The truth is, I know he can do better than me, and I'm sure he knows too. He's great and supportive and tells me I'm beautiful etc. We communicate but I can see this situation is starting to frustrate him now.\n\n In the first six months of our relationship he did cheat on me and that's something I'm still dealing with. I'm constantly thinking that if he cheated on me before I had a baby and looked better, what's stopping him now? \n\nI know that I need to work on this myself and regain some confidence but even when my self esteem is better, I'll always feel like he can do a lot better than me. I don't think that the solution is to break up. I really do love him, as hard as our relationship has been at times. What are some ways I can be rid of feeling inadequate?\nTL;DR:"}

When he is upset about something that happens - not between us - and we are discussing it, he gets loud and intense. This can be from something a family member said or did, our child's behavior (which can be very challenging), etc.  Today, he was expressing frustration and started to get louder and more intense. I said, 'I hear you.\"  He says I use that to shut him off. \n\nI think he's right in one regard. I don't understand the need to get intense about things when I'm in his corner, interested in solving the problem, etc. I do have a different take on the situations sometimes and it seems I come across as dismissive or like his take on things is wrong. But I also do have a pretty visceral response to the anger rising. \n\nOur daughter had a rough night last night. Rude behavior, out of control resistance, etc. This happens, we work through it at home and with therapy and come out on the other side. This morning, before discussing with her, he wanted to talk and said she really needed to feel the consequences we had for her (I agree) and kept getting more intense as he explained his frustration. I was torn between supporting him - because the behavior really sucks - and responding as I was really uncomfortable with the raising of the voice. \n\nHe then said, \"She can't do this @$#@ to us.\" This to me also showed a really different understanding of the situation. Our daughter, who is new to our family, is a tween learning her way. Her behavior is troubling, maddening, etc. and I have lost my cool quite a few times.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: How do I [19/F] ask an old friend [21/M] out on a date/for a relationship?\nPOST: Hey, Reddit! I'm fairly new here, so I don't know too much about how this site works as far as posting goes. \n\nI just got out of a really rough patch. My first relationship ended in a really bad way. Friends were lost, other people revealed themselves to be my true friends and my ex and I are on awful terms. I thought I was happy in that relationship but retrospectively there were many things that I should have noticed beforehand to spare myself the trauma that I have endured for these past few months.\n\nWhen talking to family at a going away party, a cousin of mine suggested that I talk to an old friend of mine (21/M that I mentioned in the title) to strike something up. We were rather fond of each other back in high school but neither of us said anything about it to initiate any type of dating. We haven't gone to the same school in three years, but we have kept in contact minimally, exchanging birthday wishes, and randomly dropping in on one another to check up. Most people that I talk to confirm that he still has feelings for me, and I have enough feelings to want to ask him out on a date.\n\nThe problem is that we don't talk frequently enough to have a basis for me to be able to simply say, \"Hey! Let's go on a date!\" without it seeming out of nowhere, and I am not at all keen on how to get dates. My ex and I had shared classes together in high school, and he was the one who initiated our circumstances. Up until then, I had never had a boyfriend before. Only several potentials.\n\nSo my question is, Reddit, how would I go about asking out an old friend of mine without it seeming to spring out of nowhere/ looking like a weirdo? Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

I recently graduated from college and have been living in a tiny tiny apartment trying to make ends meet, but it hasn't been easy. Sometimes I have to ask for help. But I'd really like to become independent and save up some money, vs always feeling like I'm indebted to my parents.\n\nI recently got a job offer for a full time position and am excited to make enough to survive and flourish on my own. However, my parents have been asking about the summer and where my sister will go. My current apartment is a studio ~400 sq feet and there's little space for me and my sister. We can make it work, but I think there won't be very much personal space. I really, really wish I could make my sister feel more at home in my apartment, for her to feel like she can stay and have her own room and not be bothered, but as it is, it's very cramped. \n\nI'm conflicted because I want her to feel like she can stay over, but I also want to make sure I save up enough for the future. As it stands, my housing is 25% of my income, which I'm kind of uncomfortable with. If I find a 2 br, or even a 1 br, it'll cost twice as much, and I really would feel bad spending 50% of my income on housing, esp when she stays over only during breaks. I also wonder how much of a responsibility I have to fend for her needs. I'm not her parent, and I don't feel it's fair, exactly, for me to try to give her the kind of environment we had when our parents had a house here - I just don't have the income to match it.\n\nI feel guilty and sad but at the same time, entitled to spend my earnings as I see fit. I'm not a total scrooge, but I just wish I could find a way to compromise between all parties.\nTL;DR:"}

She was laughing and smiling almost the entire time. We were even talking about future dates and going to a restaurant after spending all day at the bar (this was earlier in the day).\n\nThen toward the end of the 5 hour she said she actually wasn't hungry enough to go to the restaurant, I said ok we did spend all day together that's perfectly fine. \n\nSo then we walked to her car and I was gonna go for the kiss but she dodged it and turned it into a hug. I was shocked I thought everything was going so well...\n\nThen the curiosity was killing me so I texted her and was kind forward about it (maybe this was a mistake). Basically asked her what the deal was and she said she wasn't sure if she was feeling it between us 100% and that she is kind of conservative and didn't want to fake it.\n\nI said that was fine I didn't want to rush things and asked her if she still wanted to go on another date to feel it out. After a long delay she answered saying she wanted to end it hear and the reason she gave is that she didn't feel a connection.\n\nI find that answer hard to believe and I feel like it may have been something else I did or said or maybe didn't do during those 5 hours but I can't figure out what.\n\nI asked if she still wanted to be friends and go to a fair in my town next week and she said shes ok with being friends and that she would check her schedule\nTL;DR:"}

I have never worn make-up or spent any substantial amount of time on my looks unless it was a special occasions like a party, dinner with one of our families, etc. The other night he told me that he's very upset that I don't do these things. That he sees other girls going to class in with make-up on and in a nice outfit and it makes him depressed that I don't. (we have no classes together) When I told him that I didn't really want to do that he insisted this was only because I dislike preppy girls and didn't want to be seen as one. It's not. I like make-up, I just consider daily usage of it a waste of time when I look perfectly fine without it. \n\nHe also says that I don't put any effort into us while he puts in a lot. The thing is, I don't see that. I'm in an aggressive major, taking 22 credits, and working 10 hours a week, but I still take the time to visit him at his apartment at least once a week, often more than that. During these visits I rarely have the energy to do much. We normally watch a TV show or play card games or adult activities. It upsets him that I'm not more social/energetic during these visits. I guess I should add that he is taking 14 credits and doesn't have a job.\n\nThe things he said hurt me a lot and I don't know what to do. I tried to explain that I just don't have the time to work on my looks constantly and didn't understand why this suddenly bothered him. The comments about my not putting in effort really offend me because I can't think of one thing he does that I'd consider \"effort\" on his part other than make me tea when I ask him to....\nTL;DR:"}

She has a history of picking guys who don't treat her very well, and that saddens me, but it's been nothing serious, until now.\n\nToday a close friend of my sister's called my family to let us know that my sister's new boyfriend has been **taking cocaine, and giving her ecstasy**. There is also a great deal of **yelling** and verbal abuse when he feels he isn't controlling her.

This also explains why she has been withdrawing copious amounts of cash from her account, she has been paying for him as well.\n\nTo me, this seems like a very serious situation, and it seems she felt that she could not tell me or any of the people close to her, she clearly needs help but I don't even know where to begin.

I drank and had a lot parties with my classmates (all males, because engineer degree) and met girls from another degrees, but I guess I was not intrested in dating. Just wanted to play on computer and get drunk. Now at present I think I have waken now. I feel now that I want to have someone to take care about and give love and receive it also.\n\nPersona: OK looking guy who is below average weight (maybe little beerbelly :)). I work out almost every day doing bodyweight excercises. I laugh and smile a lot and make joke about almost everything. I'm a little shy around people I don't know, but I get past to it very quickly. Got job in big IT company as IT help.\n\nSo to my hobbies: I love to cook. I watch a lot cooking shows (Gordon Ramsay woo!) and try new recipes, but you can't meet anyone when you are cooking at home. Going to bar/night club would be fun if I have friends to go with (moved to another city and friends here just play on computer). I Inline skate/ice skate sometimes. \nThe problem is now that most of what I'm doing daily revolves around computer. I'm local IT help (meet a lot people every day, so it's kinda okay?) and when I get home I usually open computer and start browsing or playing. To be honest everything seems to be dull exception playing LoL with my 5v5 ranked team and WoW raiding.\n\nI have tried online dating/tinder and had couple fun experiences, but didn't pursue those because I was not interested (?). I almost had sex with one, but froze when we were both lying on her bed clothes on. Started wondering if I have high standards or is it bad to judge from just couple incidents? Also should I pick up a hobby where I meet people who like same thing at least? Online dates especially tinder ones feel really shallow when you just know face, name, somewhat she likes etc.\nTL;DR:"}

When my ex and I decided to end it, within two weeks of us breaking up she had (as well as her friends) messaged me to say that she had slept with at least one other guy because she \"couldn't bare to think you [rei154] were my last\", but had also contracted an STI off him. As well as this, her addiction to Marijuana grew stronger and it became harder to be around her, because at the time I still loved her. Over the next year, shit kept happening to her that was entirely preventable, but she refused to deal with the situations any differently to how she already was. Because of this, I decided to break all contact with her because it was royally messing up my life at the time.\nNow I don't want this to turn into a rant about my ex (that would be fun for no one), so I'll stop short and say that I believe that she is a very good person, who was brought up and treated incredibly badly.\nFast forward to present, in current relationship (six months and counting!) with the complete opposite to my ex in most ways; doesn't drink much, no drugs, doesn't go clubbing often, etc, etc. Things could not be smoother in this relationship. The problem is, I'm finding it harder and harder to not think about my ex. I don't know why, she did so much to hurt me and we were such different people, yet I can't help but wonder if she is okay.\nThis hasn't changed my behaviour with my current girlfriend at all, but I'm worried it might soon, and I'm worried my feelings for my ex might come back.\nTL;DR:"}

At this point I call my Grandpa for help and let him take over. He freaked out but then he started laughing about it once he stopped the water, As I headed towards the kitchen I see about 20 towels on the floor with a gigantic coleman cooler collecting the water dripping out the light fixture. At that point everybody started yapping at me asking me what happened and blah \"Oh there is shit!\" blah blah \"The roof is about to fall!\" blah \"BUT ITS NEW!\" BLAH BLAH.

After watching the comings and goings of both the patrons and the employees I am 99% certain there is more than just a shoulder massage involved in the services they offer.  My boss and several other people in the complex have made it very clear that they are uncomfortable with what is goings on.  There are women who work by themselves in some of the offices that have started locking their doors and people are no longer leaving belongings in their cars they may be attractive to thieves.  What can I say to these people so they can relax about the situation?  Or should I just be less naive and take caution of men who are already taking part in illegal activity?\nTL;DR:"}

Its continuing the relationship is what i am horrible at.\n\nIll just give you my current situation because im having trouble putting this into words.\n\nI was at a New Years Party, met a girl, talked for a while, i eventually asked her if she had a partner for the midnight kiss. (Thats what the party was kinda of about)\n\nMidnight comes, we kiss, i tell her it wasnt good enough, we make out for like 15 seconds, then she pulls away and continues texting. (We both were extremely drunk and im not sure she even remembers it, as i barely do)\n\nAnyways, she adds me on facebook, We chat for a while and i get her number.\n\nNOW WHAT? \n\nThis is where i fuck up everytime.\n\nIn the last year i'd say i've gotten 5 girls numbers, none of which i have come even close to actually dating, but did land a single date with them all. \n\nSince this has happened so many times, i second guess myself like a motherfucker. I can get a girls number, but its actually using that number where i choke. Its like everytime i text the girl, the conversation is absolute shit. Always getting responses like \"Yeah, sure, alright, mhmm\" \n\nLike why give a number to a guy, if your not going to even try continuing the conversation and go on a half decent date with a guy.\n\nIm sorry this is so cluttered and confusing, please ask any questions if you need more infomation.\nTL;DR:"}

I work full time if I'm not in school. Even in school I work 30 hours a week and take a full load, and I still try and make time to hang out with these people.

He was already paying on the older child via Final Order of Paternity. We had about 60/40 time sharing, or something close to it, with me having the majority. Of course, now in Florida, child support is decreased if he has them more than 20%.\n\nWe had a temp hearing to get child support started for infant, so they added in a little more for the baby. I hadn't requested the final hearing because I am supposed to be getting a child care subsidy soon, and wanted to see what the amounts would be before we went in since child care was a concern.\n\nHowever... MAJOR change in circumstances in the past month, and this week especially.\n\nFirst, he lost his job in June. Technically, he resigned, even though he was being given the choice resign or be shown the door. He made pretty decent money.\n\nNext... he left!! Tuesday, he packed his stuff and moved to another state nearly 1000 miles away. He never told me he was planning to leave. I figured it out Friday and he admitted it and told me he was living with a relative there rent-free and looking for work up there. Then, a few days later, he left.\n\nHe obviously can't exercise his visitation now. He is now officially missing visits as of yesterday, which was his turn with the kids.\nI have done everything myself so far. All filings, hearings, etc. But... I'm lost here. \n\nDo I just ask for the final hearing right away and get the child support ordered at his current visitation, which is none? Do I request a temp hearing to get that done currently, and then get a final when the child care is figured out? I think they will still impute his income that he has always had since he is able to earn that and has for so long before, and technically, he resigned. Is that right?\nTL;DR:"}

He has also started wanting to hang out with me more all of a sudden, when he never used to want to hang out with me so that is also weird. \n\nI am thinking I want to tell her to stop texting him tonight because it is just becoming too much for me to handle, and I have had anxiety attacks night after night over this. I just want to see if any of you have any insight or advice on this situation. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

Matt and I met three years ago through mutual friends.  We hung out alone once and I thought he was a nice guy, but wasn't attracted to him physically in a romantic/sexual way; when he asked me out afterwards, I told him I thought we should just stay friends.  Over the past three years we've seen each other at group parties and events and have become friends.\n\nFast forward to this summer when I started hanging out more with this particular group that he was also part of and I get much closer with all of them.  Then three weeks ago, Matt and I hatched a plan to surprise the rest of our friends\u2026 Details are not important, but basically we spent a lot of time alone together.  Now, I should mention that this has happened to me before (guys I am friends with are attracted to me), so my \"default\" response, so to speak, is to push them away/joke about it until they stop.  So when he made it clear he was still interested in me romantically/his interest had resurfaced, I sort of dealt with it the way I know how to.  \n\nThe problem, however, is that I just realized that I've become attracted to Matt. What's the problem, you ask?  I'm leaving the country within the week. I'm not interested in long distance. \n\nSo my question is \u2013 should I even bother telling him? I feel like he has the right to know, but I also worry that it will be much more harsh to tell him that I'd like to kiss him and hold his hand and hang out with him all the time for four days and then most likely never see him again.\nTL;DR:"}

What does that actually mean?\nPOST: Using a throwaway because he uses Reddit.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years and lived together for 5. 2 months ago, he broke up with me because he 'no longer saw a future'. He said that he loved me and didn't want this relationship to end but he had to end it if he no longer saw a future. I'm still reeling from this and finding it very difficult to deal with as in my mind we were heading towards marriage and kids and he had shown no sign that this wasn't what he wanted anymore, in fact he actively spoke about the future.\n\nThe relationship hadn't deteriorated at all, there was no signs anything was wrong, so I was completely shocked by it. I don't believe there is anyone else. I'm finding it very difficult to get closure.\n\nMy question is, if a relationship is happy and healthy (which he said it was) and you've been together a long time and made plans for the future.

We have lived together for about 3 months (we share a room in a house with 3 other friends).  He is a great boyfriend.  I trust him completely, he is caring and respectful, we value the same things, etc.  I know his family very well (we are from the same town) and we expect to get married eventually.  So why do I have such doubts about our relationship?\n\nI haven't felt close to him in a very long time.  I don't feel like I can talk to him about things that are important to me, like he doesn't \"get\" me.  He's the happy-go-lucky type and doesn't ever see anything wrong in our relationship.  I think that if I tried to suggest ways to strengthen our relationship he would think it was ridiculous. A few months ago I tried to tell him that I feel somewhat bored and he hasn't said anything about it since.  All in all, I am just underwhelmed.\n\nHow do I deal with these feelings?  Should I try to get him to go to some sort of counseling with me?  We are very young, so sometimes I think that going to counseling or trying to \"reignite the spark\" is just stupid, and I should break up with him and find a new life. \n\nWhat's more important?  Security (I know he's a great guy, would be a sweet husband) or a \"connection\"?  I know the honeymoon phase doesn't last forever, but should I even be worrying about the future while I'm so young?  I'm a senior in college and plan on going to grad school, probably far away.  He says he'll go wherever I go, so I feel I need to put on my big girl britches and commit or drop the whole thing soon.\nTL;DR:"}

We agreed that we harbored no hard feelings toward each other and frequently ran into each other at shows/parties/the like and it was always totally friendly.\nHe kept on asking me to do one-on-one stuff though *(some of our regular activities while we were dating, like a particular local sushi place and stuff)*, and I didn't want to, so I did my best to kindly decline. He eventually confronted me on the matter and let the conversation drop with an \"I'll see you around.\" But today I got a message from him via Facebook:\n\n> look idk whats up but some dude has been texting me how i should leave you alone or else he'll kick my ass/show up at my work?(*he inserted the phone number here*) idk what this is but i don't want it or the drama. i just wanted to see my friend man, suffering from extreme glibarvardrawls *(a weird combination of my last name+'withdrawals')*. but its clear i'm looking for something that isn't there. this is the last you'll hear from me.\n\nNow I have no idea who this phone number belongs to, who would even say that, or why this would even be said.

Nothing; it even looks like he blocked me on Facebook. I asked our mutual friends (his best friends are still great friends to me). I talked to his sister (she and I still hang out).

He thinks just cause I'm not in the mood doesn't mean I can't give him a BJ or HJ. But in my mind, if I'm really not in the mood then he shouldn't get so upset with me. He says it always turns in an argument whenever I say \"no\", but I feel like I say yes so many other times that it shouldn't become such a big issue.

Any tips or suggestions on success?\nPOST: My girlfriend (22/f) and I (22/m) broke up 4 days ago after dating for 4 years. The reason was because, as we were both finishing school, I became increasingly more doubtful and unsure about whether I wanted to continue with our relationship. As the year progressed, I tried to isolate myself in order to try to understand why I was constantly feeling unattracted to her and why I sometimes felt like I needed to experience life more and fuck around. I ended up hurting her by not taking care of her and not making her feel loved so she broke up with me 4 days ago. As I reflected on the situation and on our relationship, I realized that we had something extremely special and that I fucked it up. I no longer felt like I wanted to fuck around. I came to the conclusion that I was not the person that I displayed through my actions wanted to be in this relationship beyond a doubt. Prior to this past year, our relationship was amazing, exciting, and inspiring. I want to marry this girl.\n\nSo, after 7 long hours of talking with her and then her father, we agreed that it was worth giving it a try. She requested that before we gave it a try that we had some space from each other for a month and a half as she felt like she needed to get over a few things before we had a fresh start. \n\nIs this a good idea?

Using him as a reference I got an offer pretty easily. Now I'm coming up on the 7 month mark and I am not at all gruntled.

Its the sort of place where you either get promoted after a year or you flounder around the bottom of the pile doing shit work for 2-3 years until you quit and right now its looking like the latter.

The neighbours are a low income family with young kids, their house is owned by the government and provided to them at low rent.\n\nThey have a tendency to watch television late into the night. I think they just leave it on while they sleep. It would be fine if they turned it down at 10pm, but they don't. It's often still loud at 2-3am. Probably later.\n\nWe have spoken to them in person a couple of times about the noise. They seem respectful and apologetic, but nothing ever really changes. After each complaint they are good for a few days before The noise returns.\n\nThings have escalated lately. We have begun calling noise control to try and get the point across. We had noise control visit last night for the second time. This morning I woke up to the TV blaring at 6:45am. They usually respond to these complaints with a weak apology, blaming a child for it, or just saying they didn't know it was on. They don't seem to like taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nAnother factor to the story is that my girlfriend often suffers from insomnia and can have a great deal of trouble getting to sleep. She already uses ear plugs and a pillow on top of her head and can still hear noise through that.\n\nIf I was to call noise control on them twice within 72 hours, their TV will be confiscated. \n\nHow should I deal with this? I am currently saving money to have a soundproof wall put between us. I could conceivably have that work completed by the end of the month. Should I wait 72 hours before calling noise control again? Or should I just lay out the punishment in the hopes that they learn a lesson from it? I am concerned about some sort of retaliation from them. Taking their TV will probably piss them off.

There's lots of rich people and celebs in the area. \n\nI work in the deli, and to the left of my department the bakery and meat department are attached. In between the bakery and the deli there's a giant post that can make it hard to see if there are any customer's, and on my side of the post bakery has a small display case of cakes and things. \n\nNow, one day I'm working away doing dishes to the far end of my department and the two bakery ladies are standing on the other side of the post chatting away. This lady comes up and starts looking at the case. So I think okay the bakery people can get this because they're literally 3 feet away. So I keep washing my dishes. I hear the lady say something and figure she's talking to the girls. \n\nThen I hear a whistle. Not a cat call, not a melody of someone going along with a song. It's one of those I want your  attention and I want it now, type of whistles. So I look up and this lady is staring at me like I'm wasting all her time. If there's one thing I hate it's being whistled or shaped at for service. So I dry my hands and wander over to see what she could possibly want. (I should tell you know she looks to be a 30-40 something with too much money and too much plastic surgery). \n\nShe wants a cake. So I grab her the cake she wants and go to get her a box. Now, being that I work in the deli, I know jack shit about bakery. I find a couple boxes, one that's just the right size, and one that's two sizes too big. As the idea dawns on me a I feel a sense of smugness. I grab the big box. Put the cake in, and package it up. As I hand it to her over the top of the case (about 5'3\", I'm 5'4\") I feel the satisfactory thud as the cake slides and hits the side of the box. \n\nEnjoy your mushed cake, bitch.\nTL;DR:"}

But over the past couple weeks there has been a guy she likes and has started kinda seeing, and it's starting to ruin me. I can't stop thinking about them together, and when I'm with her and see her texting him I get depressed.

As part of her application for my roommate's new place, the management had a form that they requested our current landlord fill out, I imagine with information regarding do we really live her, did we pay our rent on time, etc. (We have always paid on time.) The manager, who's offsite, didn't respond at all for several days, and after about a week, said the information would take a while to put together. A day or two after that we submitted our official notice that we're ending our lease, and today they wrote back:\n\n\"Thank you both for your concern and patience while we gathered the information that has been requested on the verification form for [roommate]. When [current apartment management] receive payment for the invoice attached the [new apartment] verification form will be sent.\"\n\nwith an invoice attached for some plumbing work that was done in our apartment in the beginning of February (i.e. over a month ago.) We've never been invoiced for repairs before in the two years or so that we've lived at this apartment, and this was the first time they mentioned any kind of charge for this repair. Our lease says that we're responsible for the cost of repairs that are not normal wear and tear but instead 'due to tenant misuse' (paraphrase of the lease agreement.) I don't really dispute that part of it, but do they have any obligation to provide information to other prospective landlords, or can they refuse to provide it until we pay this invoice? \n\nI mostly ask as an academic question - the invoice is <$100 so it probably won't be worth the trouble anyway.\nTL;DR:"}

For whatever reason I (age 22) keep finding myself drawn to these shitty people. I have gotten really good at identifying toxic relationships, yet I can't seem to retain my resolve when it comes to keeping them out of my life... This is typically the case in my friendships with other females. My next door neighbor, an all-around unpleasant, toxic person is having a party tonight. And for whatever reason I find myself incredibly upset I am not there - I got an invitation on facebook, but I am trying really hard not to just sweep things under the rug, and it really offends me that she doesn't respect me enough to sit down and talk with me like she said she would. By attending this gathering (If it were even possible, which it is not) I would effectively be sweeping things under the rug and I would become trapped in this cycle all over again. \nYet I can't stop feeling down on myself for not being there. I legitimately feel like a loser even though I recognize that these are people who I shouldn't want in my life. (It definitely doesn't make it better that they live right across the hall.)\nTL;DR:"}

She's a good person and she really does care about me. She has expressed *very* strong feelings for me and I know that I'm a huge part of her life, but she doesn't always seem to show it. I don't always feel the love, would be a good way of putting it.\n\n**Here's Why, I Think:** She has some issues from a past relationship. Insecurity, depression, things like that. Note: This would be a good time to mention that she is currently taking anti-depressants. Depression runs in her family.\n\nI would typically expect an insecure person to *overcompensate* for their insecurities, but she seems to do the opposite. When she gets depressed or insecure, she withdraws and becomes more distant from me. Instead of trying super hard to make sure she doesn't lose me, she just sort of *exists* as my girlfriend and comes off as apathetic.\n\nThis is compounded because I try really hard in this relationship. I get her random flowers, cook dinners, pay for 95% of everything we do, buy great gifts, take her on unique dates, I've sent her care packages when she's gone away for extended periods, etc. I'm the guy that makes her friends jealous, and she knows it and appreciates it. But I don't get much in return.\n\nI don't expect her to do all the things that I do. For me, it's mostly physical things that I wish she would do more. But besides the point, it's not that she's uninterested, it's that she *always* waits for me to make the first move, in any context, and I don't know if I can deal with it anymore. But it just makes me feel kind of shitty when my efforts aren't reciprocated, even though they are gratefully received.\nTL;DR:"}

Because of that, I have only pursued few women in my life, and most of them were unsuccessful.\n\nA consequence of that is my confidence problems (I have mostly been rejected, and that hurts even more as I don't have a \"1 in 25 is saying yes\" mentality going on), and also that I am really quickly attached to a person, that I invest myself way too much in them even before anything is going on. I sometimes fear that I appear \"obsessed\" because it can control my whole life - when it's not going well with a girl I will be pretty damn moody.\n\nI am currently in the same situation again - a REALLY cool and cute girl from college who I started to message back and forth for two weeks now. Yet I am very sure that she's not wanting the same as me (**confidence issues**) and it makes me really fucking sad, and almost unwilling to continue to pursue her. But I can't stop to think about her and feel like I am dependant on her actions to be happy (**overly attached**).

I realized in third year that this wasn't healthy for me and I should go out more to meet new people. Since then I have felt a lot happier, made tons of friends and close friends that I don't think I've ever felt so happy.\n\nNow I'm in fourth year and I've met even more people and made some new friends which I'm really thankful for. I should be really happy but everyday I feel really empty inside. I've never felt this way before so it has gotten me really confused with my emotions and depressed. I should be really happy since I've made so many close friends but it seems that no matter how many times I meet up with people or talk to my close friends I still feel really sad and empty inside. Reddit what is wrong with me? Why did I start feeling this way all of a sudden out of nowhere. I don't know why I'm so sad all the time when I should be really happy and blessed for all the friends I have.\nTL;DR:"}

Me [30f] and my SO [35m] have been together almost a year now. We met in our neighbourhood and lived one street apart. Everything was great and I had finally thought I had met \"the one\" and I know he felt the same. I spent the majority of my time at his place, and we had decided that since everything was going extremely well and we spent 99% of our time together, getting one place was a good idea. To be honest, I did have some reservations at first, but decided to forge ahead. We moved in to out apartment in Feb and I immediately relaized this may not have been the best decision, but decided to give it a go. However, somethings just not right and I dont know what. We hardy talk, the sex is non existent, we alternate sleeping on the couch, we're pretty much roommates and it is generally awkward. Something obviously isn't working and it seems as he is avoiding discussing it as he knows it will lead to a break-up conversation. He has never asked once, what is wrong, why we aren't being intimate, etc. Up until now I have been hesitant to say anything ( i know, not right by me ) as I was unsure what I wanted to do, but I am positive he/this is no longer what I want. \nReddit, my question to you.. How do I initiate a conversation that will most likely end up being a break-up / move out conversation when I don't really have any reasons except I don't want this/you??\nTL;DR:"}

Most of his life he was living in the family home but in the new year I moved out and I've taken him with me. Every morning without fail, he barks between 6am and 7:25, when I get up to walk him. Sometimes he will bark maybe twice total during that period, more recently he's been barking almost non-stop. \n\nI never go in to the room whilst he's barking, I always wait until he's stopped for about 30 seconds. I also go in between 7:15-25 every single day. Sometimes he's better than others, but how do I eliminate it entirely? he's quite the velcro dog, always following me around or sitting next to me. \n\nAnother issue I have is that when I come back home he barks incessantly. Again, I don't go in until he's finished for about half a minute, but I don't think it's stopping him from starting barking. \n\nJust to give you an idea of the layout of his room, on one side there is a dog gate that looks into the living room and the other is a solid wood door that leads through a corridor to my bedroom, which is the door I go through in the morning and when I'm back.\nTL;DR:"}

She doesn't make much money, and initially told me she makes less than $1,000 a month. I budgeted accordingly.\n\nAfter she had given her notice to work she FINALLY (after 6 months of asking) gave me a breakdown of how much she wants -- $1,500.\n\nI told her this is way more than I expected and couldn't pay it. I told her at the absolute most I can pay $1,100. I thought everything was all fine and good, but now I've heard through the grapevine that she is complaining to everyone under the sun that she's \"stressed\" about the \"pay decrease\" because she didn't factor in her insurance. She works for the school district so her insurance was very good. She also mentioned to me that the job she is leaving is now offering a raise and better benefits.\n\nI was just told from another family member that they will watch my son for FREE and I'm feeling like this is the better way to go. My mom can get her raise, not stress about money, keep her benefits, and I can put that $1,000 a month into a college fund for my son.\n\nThe biggest problem is that my mother is convinced that I am exceedingly well-off because I make more money than my parents. I'm the only one in my family to have attended college and I feel like she's looking to get paid a premium for not much work. I even asked her if she'd pick up groceries and stuff for me on occasion to somewhat justify the expense and she flat out told me 'no'. She's also mentioned going over to my sister's house to help her with her kids during the day... while I'm paying her to watch my son so he can be the center of attention. My sister won't split the cost with me or anything either -- already checked.\n\nSo, long story short, how do you think I should go about telling my mom that she should withdraw her resignation b/c she's too greedy?\nTL;DR:"}

Because of our close proximity, we've barely gone any days without sleeping over at each other's place. This year however, she has moved a few blocks away, about a 5-10 minute walk. This is where my question comes in. Now that she's further away and living with 3 other girls she actually likes living with (at least as of now), she's stated that she doesnt want to have me over every night to sleep or trade off nights and come over to my place. Shes basically stated that she wants to \"do her own thing\" and so forth. But by now I've been so spoiled I have a hard time being at my place at night and her not sleeping over.

Sure, he makes mistakes, and he may have messed up financially when he was younger, but he has come extremely far in his life. He works a good job, making better money than I do (I went to college and he didn't), and he genuinely loves me and takes care of me. \n\nI understand that I need to communicate to my mother that I'm not okay with how she speaks about Drew, but I'm not sure how.

He says no, he hasn't been happy in any relationship in a very long time. \n\nOn the side though, he has been very cuddly, affectionate, and in general trying to be a good boyfriend.\n\nHe does suffer from a few medical conditions which make him irritable, bloated, and losing hair randomly around his body.

After I told her this, she said that she would want to move to whereever I go, throwing in that she wants to \"be with me forever.\" Being the oblivious piece of shit that I am, I didn't catch on to the significance of that conversation until well after we had parted ways. \n\nI figure that a relationship with her is inevitable since she has said that she wants to live close to me wherever I move but I want to get her out of the friend zone as fast as possible (and as not-awkward as possible). As someone who has been friendzoned multiple times in the past, I know how fucking shitty it is.\n\nSo Reddit, how the fuck do you ask girls - who are longtime friends - out? All my previous relationships have come from bars, clubs, one-night stands, etc. which explains their shittiness. Seriously, I need step-by-step guides here. I have no idea how to initiate relationships outside of the bar/club scene.\n\nI can't believe I didn't fucking see it till now.\nTL;DR:"}

We have similar ideals and values but have no problem differing in opinions.  We are not 100% alike but compliment each other perfectly.  I would rather spend time with her than doing anything else on the planet.  We do not fight at all and have a seemingly perfect relationship from the outside.  The only problem: sex.\n\nI was my girlfriend's first sexual partner and she was not mine.  We have been having mediocre sex for 2 years now and it's just as infrequent as it has ever been. Being her first sexual partner, I knew she would struggle with being comfortable in the bedroom but after 2 years nothing has changed.  We have almost no intimacy in our sex life and when we do have sex it's treated like a chore. \n\nSo after two years she has admitted to asexual feelings throughout our entire relationship.  Her asexuality has prevented her from ever really turning me on because I can see how fake/forced her sexual desires are.   She is still willing to partake is sexual activities to please me, but she has no sexual desires of her own.  She has transformed from my girlfriend into just my best friend.  I would still rather spend time with her than with anyone else, but my sexual needs are just not being met and haven't been met for the last 2 years.  \n\nI would feel petty for ending a perfect relationship over just our sex life, but our lack of intimate sexual encounters is stressing the rest of our relationship.  I want to continue the relationship but I don't think I could live with a non existent intimate sex life.  How can I find the intimacy I need in other parts of our relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

And so that I wasn't misunderstanding, I asked him if that meant I was not pretty to him. I can't remember his exact words but it was essentially, that's accurate. I asked him if any woman was pretty to him, and he said no, that he doesn't know how to measure something like that. That's just not how his mind works. I'm okay now with him not finding me pretty, as long as no other woman is pretty to him. I'm certain he's heterosexual. He says that he is attracted to me and that I am attractive and he finds me beautiful, but he's more attracted to personality than looks, though looks are a part of what attracts him. I've spoken with a friend about this and he said he's heard about that being a thing. Not being able to \"see\" beauty & prettiness.

My mother has met him a few times now, but she doesn't know him too well yet. The rest of my family [M35, F42, M47] and their spouses have not met him. \n\nMy oldest brother and his wife are the biggest issue. They are uncomfortable with me bringing my SO to dinner on Thursday. Of course, in true dysfunctional style, they didn't actually talk to me about this, instead they made our mother communicate for them. The reason they gave for the discomfort is that they don't know him, and they don't want a stranger judging how they parent. Now, they are shitty parents. Not abusive or neglectful, just shitty. They are agoraphobic, hypochondriac, paranoid, and delusional. They are people who should not have been allowed to adopt children. The rest of the family, even my extremely forgiving and kind-hearted brother think they are off their rockers. \n\nMy family only gets all together for holidays and kid's birthdays. I don't feel that a kid's birthday party is the best time to introduce my SO to my family, so I've been planning on bringing him to Thanksgiving for a while. \n\nI'm bringing my SO on Thursday, that is not a question. He is my love, he is my other half, he is *my* family. I was married for 6 years to a man that my family liked, even my asshole oldest brother and his batshit insane wife. Of course they didn't know that my marriage was unhealthy, we were unhappy a lot of the time. Now I have a man that loves me so thoroughly, a man that is patient with my flaws, a man that inspires me to do better for myself, but that apparently doesn't matter to them.

It's not like i was scared to talk, i just didn't want to.  Even in highschool, i wouldn't talk. My boyfriend asked me to go to a party with him near the end of high school and begged, \"Please don't be shy... Please.\" It made me extremely upset, and when he left, his best friend comforted me and handed me a drink. I became drunk, and... well... i was what everyone was talking about the following Monday because of how crazy i went.  I go to camps with new people, and i always go with the mindset that they aren't from my school and they don't know me, so i can be myself. But i try to make conversation, feel awkward, and shut up. It's like i have a social disorder. Now, if i know someone, i talk perfectly fine like i would family. But i HATE that i have to be comfortable to be able to not be awkward.\n\nTomorrow, i'm going to a marching clinic for the college i'm going to. I want to be outgoing. I can't stay a quiet person if i want to do great things in life. I'm an introvert. i don't care if i have to PRETEND that i'm outgoing, i just want to be someone, unlike how i spent the last 12 years. But, i'm not good at keeping a conversation, or starting. Any ideas on how i can pull it off?\nTL;DR:"}

I feel like most of the time I'm trying super hard, but she is super stressed out and wishes I was perfect. Well, maybe not perfect but more like the guy I was at the beginning of the relationship. I'm not sure I can still be that guy. I feel like the relationship has been sour for over a year and that has made me spiteful, hateful, and just not wanting to keep trying.\n\nSo with that in mind, how can I handle a breakup if/when it comes. Currently, we are living together in a 2br/2ba apartment with just us, no pets, no kids. I'm just worried if we break up, I'm gonna have to leave and end up paying rent at a place I'm not living. Or if I do stay, it will be awkward or she might want to work things out which I probably will not want to do.\nTL;DR:"}

In this game you can bind your keys to the different types of grenades for fast access. As a result of this and all of the other keys in use, all the keys that are available are super uncomfortable as a push to talk. Then I had a great idea. I went on Amazon, and bought a pedal that I could connect to my PC. I couldn't find the exact one, but this is similar  . Paid extra for overnight shipping and viola! I had push to talk bound to the pedal the next day. It all felt so natural. Now, I'm 15 and just recently I got my learners permit to drive on with a parent or guardian. My mom does this thing where she asks me to drive her to places to run errands or buy groceries so I can get a lot of practice in. One day she asked me to take her to the local grocery store. Me being the kid that loves driving, I agreed. Now at this point, me pushing down a pedal to talk to someone became complete muscle memory. Around 2 minutes into the drive we have to stop at a red light. My mom starts talking to me about what car I want to get when I turn 16. I opened my mouth, and it happened. Next thing I know the frontside of the car that I'm driving is in the bumper of the car in front of me. \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be driving my own car for a while.\nTL;DR:"}

I grew up moving from house to house, apartment to apartment my whole life with her. She'd bring a new asshole home every once in a while, or she'd bring back the last asshole who had newly promised to not be a jerk any more. She always claimed that it would be different this time. \n\nWell, I'm in another country loving life. I've been here for a little over a year. I came home last July to see family, and I learn two things: \n\n1. The last asshole (who I hated from The First Straw) she was seeing off and on again finally pulled the One Last Straw when she found out he was AIDS positive (after dating him for a couple years). \n\n2. She had a new boyfriend. They'd been dating for a few months. \n\nI met this new guy. He seems okay, but again I'd only known him for a few days. Mom was really excited about him because he said \"I love you,\" all the time and promised her from day one that she was the one he was going to marry. He's already left her once (because he's allergic to dogs and my mom has a very poorly behaved one at home) but he's come back swearing he'll be better. Of course, she throws caution to the wind and has married him just yesterday. After knowing him a year. I know that a lot of people get married quickly, but I'm still waiting for his skeletons to come crawling out of the closet. When they do, it won't be as easy as telling him to move his shit out. Divorces are expensive, and she's terrible with money. \n\nI can't be happy for her. I don't even want to be. She's done this way too many times to just marry someone she's already broken things off with considering her history. Is this awful me of?\nTL;DR:"}

So I'd be a shitty girlfriend.''\n3. When I started opening up to her, about how much I liked her. She said ''Don't. I'm just shit.

(22F) & (26M)\nPOST: Ok so I've been on a few dates with this guy and we like each other :) \n\nI was surprised that he didn't seem like the hit-it-and-quit-it type of guy based on the fact that he seemed hesitant to invite me to his place when I suggested it and the fact that he actually seemed into planning and going on these dates.\n\nSo after I concluded that this relationship could possibly go somewhere, we had sex after our 3rd date. Since then, I've noticed he's been a little distant. Not ignoring me completely, but hasn't been texting as much, no snapchatting like before, hasn't really been asking to go out on dates (I guess it might be too early to tell because we did just hook up a few days ago), etc. But the interest has definitely diminished.\n\nBut we were texting last night and the topic of sex came up. I guess we got to sexting a little bit and were talking about all of the things we liked in bed / wanted to try. \n\nHe was really into it and pretty much the only time he initiates texting now is to talk about hooking up again or hinting at getting some sexy pics. Now I'm scared that he thinks of me as a sex-buddy rather than someone he wants to go out on dates with. \n\nWhat should I do? I tried saying 'I just took a sexy pic but you have to guess my favorite movie to get it first!' just to kinda spark his interest again but he still hasn't seemed interested in talking about normal stuff. \n\nWe're supposed to hang out tomorrow (my idea), presumably have sex again and this time get freakier bc we know what each person likes. But I don't want to be a fuck buddy, I wanna be the girlfriend he has hot sex with.\nTL;DR:"}

We talked it through.  It had been a year or two since the last time.  That's an issue I'm working on.\n\nNow she has a new close male work friend.  I won't go into details, but she hides things from me with him and does other things to make me a bit suspicious.  So...I snooped again, and this time, all texts from her new friend have been deleted and I saw a google search for \"how to get over a guy\" near some searches of his name and views of his Facebook profile.\n\nI asked her about this guy, not mentioning the snooping, and she denied any feelings, we talked for a long time about our relationship and she insisted that she only loves me and I mean the world to her, and that she really wants to work towards getting this relationship back out of the rut we've been in (we both work all the time and barely see each other).\n\nI think if I cop to the snooping, we might have a more honest conversation about what's actually going on (if something is) and why she's having these feelings so we can either work through it together (my preference) or move on.  But obviously, it will open the pandora's box of the snooping.\n\nThink it's worth it to admit to the snooping to hopefully get to the bottom of this?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been seeing him on a purely friendly basis. Last night he came over for dinner and over a healthy amount of wine confessed that the reason we didn't make it was the fact that he's never been comfortable in \"run of the mill\" relationships with one primary partner ( open/closed).\n\nHe essentially felt like his interactions with people where limited and seeing as how he's always struggled with labels, he hates being labelled in anyway. ( Oh, also, he's just realised that he's been struggling though depression and anxiety over his identity).\n\nWe are already, overly intimate in the way we react with each other ( We still share and have an emotional connection) and, this wouldn't be on r/relationships if we hadn't slept together after he disclosed to me that he's back with his ex in a \"label free not really a relationship \" relationship.\n\nMy question is: I'm a fairly open person, I care about my ex, but I'm not particularly attracted to poly/monogamish/ non monogamous relationships.\n\nIf I continue seeing my ex ( in whatever capacity) am I opening myself up to more pain? Also, is he getting to have and eat ALL the cake?\nTL;DR:"}

We've been touring the US for about 3 years now and have managed to do okay. However, this summer our drives are long and our payment every night is a little short of what we need to get to the next venue. Our drives are 6 hours or about 150 bucks worth of gas and we get 100 bucks a night. We have to pass our per diems every day to band members to eat which ends up being 30 dollars or 5 bucks a person.\n\nSo anyways, we're putting out a new album, which we're touring to promote and I need to motivate my band to push that album and walk around and sell it to every kid at every show, so that we can afford to make our next drive, which as the tour manager, it is my job to see that we do. We've been pretty good at hustling when we try, but the past few years have gotten so burnt out on pushing the same album. A lot of times people will do it, but sometimes some of the guys in the band will just kind of say \"fuck off\" and go sit at the bar and drink, or try to get laid, or sleep or whatever. Sometimes they get cocky and don't care. \n\nSo I need a way to motivate them and call them out if they do this to get them to want to make some money each night and convince them that they should be doing this rather than sitting at the bar or sticking their dick in girls.\nTL;DR:"}

We are very open to each other and share a lot of personal stories about our lives. Basically we trust each other a lot and look out for one another if in need. Now, one of my female friend was curious about our relationship status, 2 of the males were single until it was my turn. I told them all that I will not marry or have children simply because I don't want to pass down flawed traits and deal with children who have disabilities. I explained to them that the personal experience was very painful but I worked hard to establish my standing in society today. I have also explained to them that it will be financially and emotionally expensive so its better if I stay single for my on sanity (and for others). Well, one of the female friends got upset to hear this and says I am a cold-hearted selfish prick who doesn't want to take up responsibility of being a father. I said, no that was not the reason and immediately questioned her issue with my choice. She immediately flips it on me and says some other nasty things about me (like about how I was still a little boy in a grown man's body, thats one example - there were more I can't remember), which rather ended up humiliating me in front of my friends. They kindly told her that she was wrong and I had the right to make my own choice. But all she does is storms off and calls me names. I've never felt so low in my life (in front of others), its a choice I made for myself and I don't know why she's verbally attacking me?\nTL;DR:"}

After a very intense amount of texting and joking about flying over to see each other before I move closer to her for a new job.\n\n10 days ago she joked about me going over for an event she had a spare ticket for and I said why not as I had nothing else planned for the weekend. So I booked flights once we agreed it would be fun to meet up and I ended up going over.\n\nThe first night we spent time with some of her friends then went back to hers for some food and after a long while we ended up kissing and I spent the night in her bed and the following two nights as well however we didn't have sex as she wanted to take it slow. Every time I went to kiss her she had this stupid amazing grin on her face and I probably did too. When I left early on Monday morning I got quite a few goodbye kisses and we even discussed a potential for another date when I was back over.\n\nSince I have gotten back the messages have dried up on her end and I am not wanting to push too much. I am concerned that maybe I am reading too much in to this as she has a load on her plate with work and moving to a new flat the other thing would be that she is just not interested.

Do I have anything to apologize for?\nPOST: I like to have friends over or go out with friends. My wife constantly complains about having too many chores but she has OCD, which she readily admits to. She vacuums the house multiple times a day. She has to iron everything. We have a 1st grader and she irons all of the kid's clothes (everything, not just school clothes), and does the kid's hair every morning. Having friends over gives her anxiety. Going out also makes her anxious because she thinks about what she has to do at home and always wants to leave earlier than I do. I feel her anxiety is of her own creation, not any external influence.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back:  We had to go to the funeral of a close friend's mom (whom I also knew fairly well). It was actually a \"celebration of life\" and was nice. I was able to talk to a bunch of friends whom I haven't seen in a while (see above paragraph for why). The wife gets anxious and wants to leave in the middle of the eulogies. I think it's inappropriate and refuse. It just goes downhill. When we finally left, I just told her I don't like doing anything with her anymore. That hurt her feelings and she wants me to apologize. I don't think I have anything to apologize for.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: A bizarre phenomenon happened today involving static electricity. Can you help me explain it?\nPOST: This scenario involved a room with a lightswitch on one wall, a table in the center of the floor, and a toy \"panic button\" sitting on the table. The toy is essentially a battery-operated button that makes a siren noise when you push it. No other items were on the table.\n\nWhat happened: The lights were off, so I walked across the floor to turn on the lightswitch. The instant my finger touched the lightswitch and pushed it on, a nasty jolt of static electricity discharged between my fingertip and the lightswitch. Simultaneously, the panic button toy (resting four feet away on top of a table) was activated, and began blaring siren noises. In no way did I make contact with the toy or the table it was sitting on. Startled by the noise, I flipped the lightswitch back off, and the noise immediately ceased. Subsequent attempts to replicate the phenomenon were unsuccessful.\n\nI don't know much about electronics, but I know I must have completed some kind of circuit between the floor, the wires in the wall, and the toy. Was this done through indirect contact with the toy via the table/floor, or was this an electrical field of some kind?\nTL;DR:"}

Cute girl came in to cash some birthday checks. I just started working there and so I was new to the system on the computer and that gave her the ability to start a conversation by being sassy in a flirty way. I was flirty back. We talked for a while, we were able to as I missed a step during the process and we had to wait for some time. Had a small back and forth that kinda sealed the deal that we like each other. When we finally got done with everything, she was taking some time to fiddle around in her purse and do something else, wasn't sure at the time. As she was about to walk away though, she hands me a folded up piece of paper with her number on it. I'm pretty excited, I don't ever get girl's numbers unless I ask for it, and even then, I haven't dated in... 4 years (oh god...).\n\nI called her that night and we've been texting since. We have a date planned tomorrow. I'm good on that front, but what I'm worried about is how to handle the situation with her kid. I know I just met her but I'm a guy who plans stuff like that out, or at least wants to know how I should handle it when the time comes. She has a 3 year old, father isn't in the picture anymore, so it's just her taking care of him. I'm very interested in her and I'm worried that either I'm going to meet the kid too early, realize I don't want to date her, then feel like I should stay for the kid, or meet the kid too late and have her think that I don't really care. She does live pretty far away so seeing him probably won't come up naturally unless I go out to her, which won't be happening tomorrow. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

The company has been in operation for 1 year. I started the company right after college. My ex on the other hand worked for 6 years in the wedding planning business , where she made a little bit more than I did. She used to hang it over my head that, she made more than me. Me being competitive, I took it as a challenge and sought to improve my company. However, my ex doesn't realize time and energy are required to grow a business. Accordingly I'd spend long nights in the office making money. When my ex and I first met each other we had sex numerous times a day. After the honeymoon phase, we had sex an average of 2x or 3x a day. \n\nMy ex is a bit manipulative, she describes our relationship to anyone that'll listen that I'm not having sex with her at all. I imagine my ex rationalized she'd be justified in cheating on me, if I didn't have sex with her. But as explained above that wasn't the case.\n\n It was a bit emasculating, being with a female that made more than me, especially when she rubbed it in my face. But my ex and I earn toward the top of our age range, but acts like my accomplishments aren't up to par.

But, like all good things, Fox killed it in its prime. Had the series continued to run, I'm sure Whedon, et al, would have produced much more quality programming. Maybe not. We'll never know. But by killing Firefly, Fox transmuted it from a great TV show into a underground cultural phenomenon. We wouldn't have Serenity otherwise. They did the same thing to Futurama and Family guy. I almost feel like I should thank the bastards.\n\nA more serious example would be practically any foundation you've ever heard of. Organizations for the benefit of breast cancer patients, for rape victims, for murdered friends/family, natural disaster victims, etc. None of them would exist without the initial tragedy.\n\nA more serious example still would be what's happening with the US Government (which, perhaps appropriately, Fox is also in the process of killing). My rational self tells me that greed and lust for power are at the heart of the endless woes that afflict this country.

After almost a decade of marriage, he still spends too much money without consulting me (36F).\nPOST: My husband had abysmal credit when we met, and I'm the polar opposite. I hold all the credit cards, home mortgage, etc. because of this. I do the household budget and pay all the bills. We have children and both work full time. I am very, VERY financially prudent. He, on the other hand, spends money like it's unlimited (eating out 3 times/day, hobbies, etc.) and honestly doesn't think he's doing anything wrong because he's still earning a paycheck. He'll buy something and lie about how much or hide it from me because 'I'll get mad anyways'.\n\nHe cannot be trusted with a credit card (ADD), but he travels with work so he NEEDS a credit card. Despite lots of 'talks, it has now dawned on me that he has been exceeding his travel budget for the past 2 years by hundreds per month, all the while claiming that it will be reimbursed....well, it's now clear that it's not going to be, and he's simply been overspending. On my personal credit card that I trusted him with. The damage is in the thousands.\n\nAt this point, I'm debating going to counseling myself to learn how not to resent him for this and take his negligence personally. If I cut off the credit card, it causes him issues professionally. But I'm getting frustrated that despite my well-paying job, I am forced to live frugally because he won't. I know this isn't the worst complaint to have, because he's great in so many other ways, but it still eats away at me.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dogs\nTITLE: Older dog incontinence, should I get a second opinion?\nPOST: Hi guys, it's my first post to this forum and I've read the rules, I hope I'm following them.  \n  \nBackground: I'm a crazy ball of worry when it comes to my dog. He's 10 now, neutered about 8 months ago, and has started leaking when he's sleeping if he has a full enough bladder (If I don't take him out 1-2 hours after eating and then once more at least 1-2 hours after that. Also, there's a lot of water in his food because he has congenital megaesophagus- so it's not the eating that's the issue- it's the huge water intake). He recently had a UTI a few months ago, and then another a couple of weeks ago. We don't know if it was another UTI altogether, or we just never got rid of the first one (it was a bad one).  The leaking started about a month after the first round of antibiotics was over- which prompted me to take him to the vet, where a UA found that he had a bad UTI.  \n  \nBottom line: He's been to the vet a *lot*. He had a full senior blood panel and extensive x-rays 8 months ago before being neutered. He's had 2 Urinalysis reports for these UTIs. His UTI is gone, his urine looks great- but he's still leaking at night. My vet says that this is common in older dogs and that we do not need to test for bladder cancer. I think a normal person would just be fine with this, but I worry that I should get a second opinion. Why? I think I'm nuts. Am I being ridiculous? He has no symptoms of bladder cancer other than the one UTI which can sometimes show up with cancer, and the slight nighttime leaking.  \n  \nMoney for the ultrasound test is a bit of an issue. I'm worried that my dog-related anxiety is going to cost me $250-$500 (that I can't really afford) for no reason, OR that my worry about the money is going to keep me from detecting a problem with my dog (even though the vet says it's fine?).\nTL;DR:"}

I'm looking for simple things because I'm not much of a cook, although I'm willing to try. As far as the exercising, I'm enrolled at Planet Fitness, I go about every couple days but I'm trying to gain the motivation to make it a daily task.

I used being exhausted/tired as an excuse (which does contribute to the difficulty of making convos) and now she's buying me coffee and other drinks when we see each other. I'm not that bad socially but all my friends have had some sort of common interest with me, and they were always video games, music, drums, biking, drawing, etc. so talking was easy, with a myriad of people.

I felt like I got a vibe - he always seems engaged and a little nervous when talking to me. We are in a language practice group together (it meets once a week), and in those conversations he has mentioned paying attention to what I listen to on social media, etc. I get the impression that he is a little shy and quirky. \n\nNow, I know that the above are not at all certain indications that he is interested. I've always had a little crush and wanted to get to know him more, so I asked him out to visit a museum. I didn't say \"I'm interested, let's go on a date\", instead it was more like \"I like art, you like art, would you be interested in coming to this exhibition with me\". He said yes and we had a really nice time. We had quite animated conversations about our interests in art, dreams, philosophy and music, and he suggested grabbing lunch after the museum.

I need him to talk to me so I can try and understand, but when we talk about things he just clams up and says \"I don't know\". He's even said that he wants to fix things. That he wants to try and make this work. Is this something that I can help him with? I want him to work with me, communicate with me, and to try and forgive each other for what we've done. I love this man too much to just let him go. What can I say to him to help him in this process?\nTL;DR:"}

[18M]\nPOST: This is my first time posting here so forgive me if I'm breaking any rules or if it's the wrong place.\n\nA couple days ago I hooked up with one of my good friends and I've been feeling really bad about it. She is sort of dating this other guy, not officially boyfriend and girlfriend or anything but she's definitely interested in him. \n\nWe were laying in bed together talking and she told me it was sort of a \"last hurrah\" before she got into a serious relationship. After that night I've felt a bit more attached to her but I don't see myself having a chance with her as she likes this other guy. It just feels really shitty to not be able to tell her how I feel or act on my feelings. \n\nI'd much rather just remain friends than ruin anything by trying to make it something more. I don't feel used or anything like that, just a bit disappointed in myself that I did that because I am one to get attached easily (which I'm working on) yet I knew she was seeing someone. If anyone has any advice, maybe a different viewpoint on the subject or just any thoughts at all please share.\nTL;DR:"}

The issues I have noticed are most people on here are looking/living at/in high cost areas (cost of living, housing, etc.). So I decided to post myself just to get input. \n\nNote: I have not made any decision yet, just weighing the odds\n\nAnyway, I am a single male, engineer, making 62K a year living in the south. Cost of living is not that high and I am tired of renting.  The biggest issue with renting in the area is that the demand is high and so the costs are thus high, plus I have a dog and cat which make finding a place a pain.\n\nI am paying $1200 a month right now for a crappy 2BR place and after speaking with a lot of coworkers, they think I should just buy.  I have 7K in savings right now, and am paying ~385 a month toward student loans and car loan.  Utilities are low here (25 for water and 90 for electricity a month) and I will be getting rid of Uverse (big mistake) in February to save myself 220 a month.\n\nThere are quite a bit of houses here I am looking at for around 130K, but I do not have a down payment. I do not want to use my savings, and so was looking at FHA and RD loans with 0% down. According to mortgage calculators I could be paying less than 1K a month including insurance and taxes. It seems like a easy decision, but I'm still hesitant. I'm very cautious in big decisions and always have been.\n\nSo what would you do in this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

I have had a gall bladder scan done and it came back fine. I have also had an endoscopy and colonoscopy which were fine. \n\nLast year I was fed up and went to my gynecologist and she thought there was a possibility of endometriosis. I went on birth control (never had the need before because I'm married to a woman if you catch my drift) and the pain subsided for awhile until a few months ago. My gyno had told me the only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis was an exploratory laproscopic procedure. I had the surgery 2 days ago and everything came back normal and healthy.\n\nI am at a loss as to what to do next.

The card's billing address is in Belfast because I've moved house 3 times in scotland over the last 3 years, so it's more consistent this way. \n\nSo when I register on shopto.net, add my card, add my delivery address (which let me put it in as the Scotland address, which checked out) with absolutely no problem.\n\nSo I put UMvC3 in the basket, and proceeded to the checkout, where I was told something like \"Due to the speed at which we dispatch items, you cannot cancel your order\". Having been led to believe that my order was going to my house in Scotland (and having literally no reason to believe otherwise) I proceeded to click ok and paid for it.\n\nIt was then, and only then, did this website tell me that (for security reasons, yeah security reasons my dick) my first two orders from their website would be delivered to the card's billing address and I couldn't change the delivery address to my current address. \n\nI got an email a few minutes later confirming my order, and that's when it became clear that they are sending my game to Belfast instead of Scotland, you know, the place where I fucking live and told them to send it to.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not your regular everyday shy either. I would never consider approaching a stranger unless I was forced to, I can't speak in larger groups (talking 3+) of people I'm not familiar with, I get nervous and self-conscious speaking one-on-one with a stranger and I even get nervous sometimes if I'm meeting up with a friend I haven't seen in awhile.\n\nIn terms of looks, I'm kind of short (5'6\") and I think I look very average. I'm not really someone who would turn heads even if I dressed up let's just put it that way.\n\nI don't really have any talents or hobbies that would impress anyone, let alone a girl. The hobbies I do have are seen as anti-social at best and absolutely reclusive at worst (programming, gaming and browsing the internet mostly). And while I enjoy hanging out and doing stuff with some of my closer friends I don't like to go partying or clubbing.\n\nI've never really had many female friends. You could probably count the number of girls I regularly talked to, over the course of my entire life up until now, on one hand. Also there are no girls at my job because I'm a software engineer working for a small but very corporate company with mostly older people, so my regular day-to-day exposure to members of the opposite sex is literally zero.\n\nAnd really the cherry on top is that I live in a city that, apparently (I wouldn't know) doesn't have the greatest dating / social scene.\n\nSo yeah, I just feel like it's almost impossible for me to -meet- any girls let alone date. Any ideas and suggestions are very welcome, but really I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest online since I don't really have anybody to talk to about this and lately I feel like I've been becoming a bit cynical.\n\nAnd sorry if it's not very coherent, I guess 5AM is not really the best time to decide to seek advice to radically change your life lol.\nTL;DR:"}

However when it goes for Shiny Buddha things are different.\n\nI don't want to start sounding like an asshole but as you get to know SB more, it becomes more obvious that his confidence is a clutch to a lot of his insecurities. He lies a lot, about things that don't matter just to make him seem cooler and more of a bro. SB also is known to go out of his way and make it sound that he is an expert at whatever he experiences. Whether its about pot, girls, parties, raves, music, how to interact with others, skating, fashion, whatever. Plus he can be a condescending fuck at times.\n\nAll this bs gets real annoying fast and as our other friends don't want to hang with him as much he starts to get a little emotional and a little bit of a bitch. But if he doesn't have us he would have no friends and I am a person who has his friends backs so I try to still hang out with him here and there.

It is a real pain to deal with cause I know he blames us for being 'immature' while he thinks he has changed so much. \n\nHonestly this guy would text me saying over the summer he realized how he alienated people and what not. I was glad for my friend, but in the end he's just acting the same way.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My friend says I'm stealing, I say I'm recouping my losses.  Your opinions?\nPOST: I recently purchased a product for my car.  It cost me several hundred dollars.  When it arrived, and upon installation, I found something was wrong on it which didn't allow me to properly install everything back to normal condition.  With it being my only vehicle, I had to make it work (the part I was replacing failed, so I had no choice).  This involved me draining some things on my car that will later require me to dig into my own pockets to fix.\n\nThe company sends me out a new part, which is correctly built this time.  I install it, dig into my own pockets to get everything into working order again, and it ends up costing me about a hundred or so more than it should have, plus the several extra hours I had to put into this.\n\nThe company sent a return shipping label with the new part to send the \"bad\" one back.  Here's the delimma.\n\nThis \"bad\" part is fixable, by a friend of mine, which could be done for about $10 (I couldn't drive down to him to have it fixed at the time, my only car, remember? So I had no transportation).  But now that it's no longer in my car, I can drive it to him to get it fixed.\n\nI want to do this, and sell it to recoup some of the losses this company caused me out of my own pocket for their mistake.  This was about a month or two ago, and they haven't contacted me again requesting me to send it back/asking if I sent it back.\n\nAm I in the wrong here, and would you consider it stealing?  Or am I right for wanting to recoup my losses for their screw up?\nTL;DR:"}

A running theme of our relationship has been that she's had issues (leaving it at that) and I've been so patient with her and \"putting up\" with a lot, and all I wanted for her was to be happy because she's been hurt so much, and this broken self-promise was hurting her and I couldn't stand it so we broke up and I hope to God it's worth it, so long as she can be happy.

We were all half in the bag, and of course the background music was pretty loud, so there were a lot of requests for people to repeat what they had said. I have this asshole-ish habit that if someone asks me \"What?\" more than twice, I engage into some silly sign-language gesturing while I over-enunciate my words to get a few laughs at the expense of those who either were too drunk to catch the story or too ignorant. Well, this girl said it twice, and without thinking, I engaged in my silly gesturing. Her face grew dark, the smiles in my group faded, and she yelled, \"There's no need for any of that!\" before she stormed off. The awkwardness of the situation subsided and the rest of us continued socializing.\n\nFast forward three years, and I'm at another party with most of the same people, and this girl as well. I knew my chances to get with her were well and gone due to our prior exchange, so I just proceeded to visit with my friends and whoever would like to join in.\n\nThis girl started participating in our converstation, and mentioned that she had been dealing with a headache for a couple weeks. I asked her if she had seen a doctor about it (because, normally headaches that last that long should be cause from concern). She replied, \"I go see my audiologist Monday so she can adjust the implant.\" I had a very puzzled look on my face, then her sister stepped in and said, \"She has a cochlear implant near the back of her head; she was born deaf.\"\n\nWhoops! Sure as shit, she turned her head and there it was; a little button stuck to her head about three inches behind her ear. She'd had it since she was 3 years old, she can hear, but near the quality of hearing of, say, someone with a hearing aid.\n\nNeedless to say, since I found out she was actually deaf, I have stopped with the sign-language nonsense.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know how they got hold of an emissions report for the same year, make, model but different VIN, or how the DMV allowed the car to be registered with a emissions report that doesn't match the vehicle VIN, but now I am in a pickle. \n\nI am going to try to let the dealership make right on their blatent error (may be unintentional, but I suspect it was intentional). However, just in case they refuse, I am wondering what my options are. I plan on asking them to go down to the inspection station with me and pay for the inspection. If anything fails, I am going to request that they pay to fix it at a different repair shop, as at this point I don't really trust them. I am assuming I can report them to the state dealership licensing body and probably should regardless of whether they fix the problem. If they refuse, is the only recourse small claims court? If I get a judgement and they refuse to pay, can I put liens against the other cars on the lot? I know I am getting the cart before the horse, but just want to know the potential course of events before I go and try to get them to make right their blunder.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm in the same boat as him, having been told I'm smart my whole life. I haven't had to study in school, I have never had a job, and I don't even have my driver's license yet as I'm afraid to take the test. My whole life has been handed to me and it feels like I've just been along for the ride. Add to that the fact that I'm not religious and I don't have much work ethic, so I find myself at a lack of motivation. Now its time to go off to college, where I'll have another four years of cushion before it finally happens: independence. The only thing I've ever really put effort into is chasing a girl who I was obsessed with, and got friendzoned hard by. Two years later, her and I are together now and have been for five months. And with that no longer hanging over my head, I'm realizing I have accomplished nothing else and feel, well, frankly like I'm just a child. For her and for myself, I want to make a real, meaningful and fruitful life for myself.\n\nI have no idea where to begin or even what I'm really asking for. But the best way I could sum it up is: how can I get myself to accomplish what I want to?\n\nA really stupid question, but the most important one in my life right now.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: The Ultimate First-World Problem: should I buy her a pearl necklace now or for Christmas?\nPOST: REALLY tough call for me, in no small part because major gift giving is a big source of stress for me because a long-term ex was pretty thankless, occasionally disappointed by more costly gifts. but I digress; that's not the issue here, really. My girlfriend mentioned in passing about three months ago that she would love to own a pearl necklace. This week, she has a girls' night party that'll be a mock Kentucky Derby, complete with (simulated) horse racing (really cool idea for a party if you ask me). So she and a lot of her friends are getting dressed to the nines like a lot of the women at the real Derby do, complete with ridiculous, over-the-top sun hats. Now she's thinking she's gonna get some costume jewelry pearls for the occasion (college budget and all). I am able to buy her a \"modest\" but good quality pearl necklace for about $300 (good luster, consistent shape between the pearls, gold clasp) but had been planning to hold it off until Christmas until I heard about this party and her plans for it. I'm sleeping on it and will or won't get the pearls tomorrow but I'm at a standstill: this is a good gift and just now nothing else in particular is occurring to me for Christmas, a big holiday to her. I have time to figure out something, but still: I can't give her another necklace. What do you all think? If it matters, we're in our mid-twenties and live about two hours apart so our busy schedules only allow us so many times a month to see each other in person (typically twice a month for two or three days). Give me a nudge, folks: this wouldn't be much of an issue to me if I could more easily give larger gifts (I don't get the shakes or anything but I almost get a sense of dread/guilt which has nothing to do with the cost of the gift itself). That my fiscally conservative mother seriously questioned my judgement, so \"extravagant\" a gift, definitely didn't help.\nTL;DR:"}

Don't get me wrong I like cuddling and all that jazz, but it just becomes too much 24/7. And it's the same with the texting it's just all the time and it just becomes too much.

I didn't say anything at the time and just brushed it off because he gets really defensive sometimes when I question him. I basically didn't want to cause a fight so I tried to ignore it. I didn't get the chance to click on the tabs or look at the times since he was in the same room. \n\nThe next day I couldn't get it off my mind. In the past we have had incidents of him using tinder on his phone after breaking up for one day. After getting back together and getting caught, he went ahead and disabled notifications showing on his lock screen and keeps his phone on silent quite often. Throughout our relationship there have also been many rumors and accusations pointed his way regarding his fidelity. I never had any solid proof of him cheating and he just flat out denied everything which is why I am still with him despite these doubts in my head. These doubts of him cheating are the cause of my trust issues and a lot of arguments. I confronted him over the phone today about chatroulette and he said that it probably was just a pop-up from some of the porn sites he visits (he named a few: redtube, youporn, youjizz, etc.). I know that pop-up ads are common among these sites and they would show up in your browsing history even if you didn't click on it. Have any of you noticed pop-ups for Chatroulette?

Or with where we go on weekends, etc.  Basically, I'll say \"We can do whatever\" or \"You go ahead and do that, and I'll do this\", and he doesn't do what he wants, because he assumes it's a test, and if he does it BAM!

So I thought f*ck this she doesn't want to speak to me, so I went out after I'd finished work myself and didn't bother telling her or attempting to meet up with her because she clearly wasn't bothering either. This was a mistake as she's now using this against me in the argument saying I have no right to be annoyed at her for her lack of communication\n\nI know I trust her completely, there's no suspicion of cheating etc. it's just totally inconsiderate behaviour and out of character.

Neither one of us necessarily believes that the other CAN'T have friends of the opposite gender, but we appear to have different understandings of what types of interactions are appropriate.\n\nWithout getting into specifics, we thought it would be interesting to turn to you guys to ask what the CONVENTIONAL wisdom is with regards to how best to approach these types of friendships when you are in a committed romantic relationship. We realize that there is probably a lot of variability from one relationship to the next, but think it might be helpful to at least have a consensus starting point.\n\nFor example, is it okay to hang out one-on-one with an opposite-gender friend?

So in July 2014 I was traveling through Santiago Chile and I met a girl via Badoo (Tinder). We met at a coffee shop near her house and 2 hours later we were in her bed. We had an amazing night and she messaged me the next night for the same. I told her from the start I was passing through and she seemed okay with this.\n\nWe had these 2 nights together and then I kept traveling through South America, but we continued to chat every day. Then she decided to buy a plane ticket and meet me in Sao Paulo Brazil for an 8 day \"honeymoon\". She rented us an apartment on AirBnB and we had an amazing week. At the end when she flew home she gave me a book of love notes she had been writing me, leading up to her visit to Brazil. I loved it and truly felt she loved me.\n\nFast forward 5 weeks and I was back in Canada when I decided to take a chance and fly back to Santiago to live with this girl. She welcomed me into her (our) apartment and we've had another amazing 3 months living together. Going on picnic's, playing games, having disagreements and making up, holidays, birthdays & I've met her family maybe 10 times and they seem to like me.\n\nI feel think I'm in love and see my future with this woman. We've discussed in detail our future, moving to Vancouver, having kids and a dog, decorating our house, etc. My question is this: I've known her for 6 months now (minus a week), is it too soon to ask her to marry me? I've heard 1-2 years but I don't feel I need to know anymore about this girl to know she's the one. I'll never know everything and I'm fine with that. There is some other reasons to move faster because we have talked about marriage in Chile with her family and moving to Canada in May which leaves us 5 months to do all that. But I don't think those facts are pressuring me to move fast.\n\nThanks for any tips/advice.\nTL;DR:"}

Our relationship was based upon an intense passion and lavish weekend trips a couple times a month.\n\nI'll also preface to say that while we were dating, I was going through a very weird stage in my life. I was living in LA, and my profession forced me to act like someone I wasn't. The city changed me and made me an egotistical, materialistic asshole. :(\n\nWhen we broke up it was a serious wake up call for me. I realized I had become someone I wasn't and didn't want to be. I spent A LOT of time reorganizing my life's priorities, expelling the negatives, and resurrecting what I used to love most about myself and my personality, which I had lost over the course while in LA.\n\nThen I made the move out of LA... to the city she lives in (a couple states away). I didn't move there because of her... but between the 3 cities I was considering, her being there and my romantic tendencies ultimately led to my decision... perhaps then it was because of her?\n\nSo here I am today. Completely ready and wanting a second chance at something real with her that is based on healthy foundation and not just fun and sex. I would love nothing more than to focus on our connection and emotional intimacy and go from there.\n\nI have explained this all to her and she reluctantly shut me down. While admitting her feelings still exist, she feels like it isn't a good idea and that she will be hurt way too much and it will be way too hard down the road.\n\nI truly do love her, and I believe she still loves me. She is the girl of my dreams. But something is stopping her....\n\nAny advice would be hugely appreciated. Thanks so much!\nTL;DR:"}

He couldn't afford the deposit either and didn't have a co-signer. My parents guarentored  him because they knew I could afford the $1060 on my own plus school (which I pay for by myself as well,) and that way the deposits would transfer from the old lease to the new one.\n\nWell now it's time to move out, and the apartment complex sends the deposit check to him (because technically his name is the first name on the lease alphabetically and that's how they decide who gets it.) He says he deserves half because we fought for the last couple of days of the lease, but paid non of it and in fact signed a contract with my parents. He refuses to pick up our calls. He can't cash it with out forging my signature (it has to have both of ours.) He keeps saying he'll mail it and won't. I brought a cop (because he's been violent in the past) to his house to try to get it in person and he says he mailed it but low and behold it never came. We checked the address we gave him and it was right.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a big deal if my parents weren't so bad off monetary wise, and need the money to help pay for doctors visits because my mom is disabled. What can I do to get the money from him with out having to get a lawyer that we can't afford involved? Is this illegal?\nTL;DR:"}

I work in the main office, and my coworker was out in the field for the past year that I have been working here. His job recently ended and he moved back to the main office for a short period of time. \n\nWe've had minimal interaction except for maybe a hi once here and there. Otherwise, no contact at all. On his second day back in the office, he emails me a work related questions to which I reply back with a normal response. He then proceeds to ask me questions to continue the conversation. The emails were a little bit flirtatious, but he's attractive so I went with it. He said he didn't know many people in the office and suggested we get lunch sometime. I thought it was a little interesting, mostly because of our lack of previous interaction,  but I agreed. \n\nFast forward to lunch...it was pleasant and it felt a little date like. Mostly because we're discussing the normal date topics. He then casually mentions a story regarding his girlfriend. I immediately realize I misinterpreted the situation and switched to friend mode. After lunch, we said good bye and parted ways. Not even five minutes later, he texts me saying he had fun and that we should hang out again soon. He found my number through a company email. He's been texting me since then and continuing the conversation even offering to come down near my place to hang out over the weekend and take me on a motorcycle ride. I'm confused by his intentions! Not sure what he wants and if I'm reading too much into his actions.\n\nAnd just to be clear, I haven't encouraged any contact etc since I found out he has a girlfriend. I've been cheated on so I am in no way interested in doing that if that's what he was looking for.\nTL;DR:"}

We're reasonably intimate, however neither of us want to have sex before marriage, and neither of us are ready for any sort of oral.\n\nHe's pretty good at making me enjoy myself when we have cuddle sessions. He also says I do a good job as well. However, he isn't very good at expressing it and doesn't seem to react as strongly as I do. Since I'm his first girlfriend, when I ask him what he would like me to do he doesn't really know. He's reasonably open to new things, at least trying them. Additionally, he's ridiculously passive (he is working on it though, I've seen a lot of improvement) so he doesn't have things that particular stand out to him as \"something he likes the most\". It's very frustrating.\n\nBut anyway, because of this I've kind of run out of ideas (he's my second boyfriend, and the first was only a month), but I want to try to do things he'll like, keep things more exciting.

I've been single for many years (my one and only boyfriend is from high school!) so my experience with romantic relationships is next to zero. I feel like I've wasted enough time telling myself one thing or another (\"Someone to love would be great! Companionship!\" \"No! A relationship is too oppressive! All the strings!\") so other perspectives are nice. \n\nI'm a very private person. I don't particularly care to seek out meeting new people, but I would talk to people if I have the chance. EX. I don't go to parties at all but I would chat with new co-workers when I get new ones. I prefer to spend my time pursuing hobbies and things that interest me.\n\nWhat scares me about relationships are all the stories I hear about women finding stalkers or abusive partners and the prospect of having to find someone that would be attracted to me (I have very low self-esteem in that regard...I've been teased about being ugly growing up). That makes me go back to my \"well it's better to be single anyway\".\n\nOn the flip side: while I'm 26 now and being single hasn't been much of a problem (it's been very comfortable actually), how would things be when I'm 40 or 50? Or when I'm an elderly without a spouse or kids? Would I be able to support myself? Someone to love and spend time with sounds really nice!\n\nBefore people tell me \"it's okay to be single, it's just society telling us we should all be partnered up!\": I know that. I just can't tell if I say that to myself because I don't make the effort to meet new people. Plus, I love the idea of romance and love, which puts a little wrinkle in it all.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [17/F] love my [18/M] boyfriend of 9 months, but I'm getting bored doing the same things and tired of getting intimate.\nPOST: My boyfriend and I will make nine months tomorrow; and I want to hang out with him, make him brownies, and snuggle. However, I know he is going to expect sex, and recently I really have not been in the mood. I'm sort of put off by the idea of sex now for some reason; although I have had it before with him. But my refusal usually leads him to horny-fueled pestering and attempts to convince me to have sex with him, which does him no favors. \n\nIt is aggravating when all I want to do is snuggle and watch TV and all he ever wants is sex. I feel as if we lost something from when we first started dating. We would always hang out, watch TV or netflix together, and snuggle and kiss.  \n\nNow, if we do anything, we go to his house and fool around and have sex. Perhaps I am exaggerating, but it seems like we have sex all the time and it's just tiring. Even making out is rough because sometimes I just want to kiss.\n\nOn a side note, he was talking about one of his friends who is in a relationship. My boyfriend said that his friend thinks the best way to have a perfect relationship is to go out to the park, take her out to eat, and stuff like that. My boyfriend remarked that isn't true because our relationship is perfect and all he does is take me out to IHOP and then take me home. That I don't need all that. Well, although I really don't like the friend for certain reasons, I couldn't help but wish my boyfriend could be more romantic.. and our time together would be less repetitive. I've tried to suggest things to him but I guess he doesn't get it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest\nTITLE: My ex's grandfather passed away today.\nPOST: I was with this girl for close to eight years, and got to know her family fairly well. After a while, they thought of me as family as well, and aside from the fact that there were so many of them, it wasn't all that bad. Well, except for the relationship itself, but I digress.\n\nToday, she sends me a text saying \"I just wanted to let you know that pappy passed away today\". At first, I'm heartbroken. I came to think of the man as a grandfather of my own, and was saddened to hear that he was as sick as he was. And then, I remembered. I remembered all of the trips to the hospital that this man made while I was with her. I remembered all of the panic every time the man coughed, because for eight years each breath was, essentially, his last.\n\nAnd now I'm 600 miles away, reading this text message with a little sadness and a lot of relief. Because I don't have to attend another one of her family's funerals. You see, in the time that we were together, I went to almost a dozen funerals, which ranged from very close family members, to people who they considered to be family but weren't even remotely close. I hated going to my own family's funerals, so being dragged to a funeral where I'm just supposed to sit in the back and look as if I'm supporting my girlfriend were virtually impossible for me to handle. This was the funeral that I was dreading going to, and because we broke up last summer, I dodged the bullet of having to attend. And, yes. I'm very much relieved.\nTL;DR:"}

We have had sort of a rough patch since she graduated college and has had a hard time finding a job in her field anywhere. She is a full time bartender at nights and I work typical 9-5 days so our schedules are opposite. She has volleyball leagues twice a week so our time together is very limited. \n\nI could tell she has been depressed and having self esteem issues and I've tried to help her along the way and compliment her as much as I could. I thought we were finally starting to make some headway when Wednesday I came home to her crying and she said it wasn't working. She had gone grocery shopping that day and said she was going to make us a meal. It never happened. The fridge is full.\n\nShe then told me that she's been depressed and suffering some the lowest self esteem she's ever had. She told me that she feels like she is incapable of taking care of herself.\n\nI ask her if there is anything wrong with the relationship and she brings up a few things about not doing things together which I explain is mostly because of the opposite schedules. But other than that she said there is nothing wrong with the relationship that is causing her to feel the way she does. The bottom line is that she needs to be alone because she's completely lost sight of her goals and feels like she can't get control of her life if she is in a relationship. But does think we could end up back together again after she gets things in order. She also said she doesn't want me to be with her if she's going to not treat me well while she is figuring shit out. (Distant, depressed, etc)\n\nIt's been a couple days and I haven't contacted her, I've given her time and space as she left for her mothers after our discussion Wednesday night. She hid her relationship status on facebook but did not end the relationship with me.\n\nWhat should I expect or do if anything? More just getting it out than anything. Feel free to ask for any other details.\nTL;DR:"}

We have similar goals in life similar ideas how to raise children. We are from the same culture too. On a utilitarian level we are made for each other. \n\nHowever, when it comes to sex and intimacy I feel like it's only one way. I do a lot for my girlfriend trying to make things special however it feels like my girlfriend just goes along with it. For example, I decided to do a surprise trip to Florida to celebrate her new promotion.  On the way there I asked her for a blow job, she just laughed at me saying she isn't in higshcool anymore. Furthermore, I have overheard her talking to her friends and she talks down about me saying \"I am just a horny boy.\"\n\nWhen I confronted her about this she just passed it off as everyone makes fun of their boyfriend and it was all just jokes. In general everything I try to bring up to her, she either responds in a condescending way, or in been there done that. She has told me, that \"I have already gotten all the crazy sex out of my system.\" \n\nFor me, my early 20s were pretty dry when it comes to dating so I never did get a chance to get any of the wild sex out of my system. I don't know what to do really, I know when it comes to the whole dating sex stuff I am behind most people but I can't just let it go. \n\nI know the common advice will be just break up with her, however what good will that do me? I will find another girl who is probably more experienced than me too. \n\nWhat do I do? I have tried talking to her how about it however she treats me like a baby. Do older couples just not have wild sex is it normal for things to tone down in your late 20s 30s?\nTL;DR:"}

However, she woke up the other day to see that the company withdrew money. She called them and was told that her school didn't tell them that she's a student again, so they continued to withdraw money. She called the school and, since we're in Boston and have had THREE blizzards back-to-back (with another tomorrow!), the school extended their add/drop period and haven't sent out letters regarding in-school deferment to loan companies yet.\n\nThe loan company told my wife to dispute the charge with the bank, the bank told my wife that she couldn't dispute it because she previously authorized the loan company to withdraw the money. However, the loan company says they can't issue a refund and my wife's college says that either the bank OR the loan company should give her a refund since she was a full-time student as of 1/20 and her loans should have been deferred for February.\n\nThis is inanely confusing.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Getting back together with your ex\nPOST: My gf [22F] and I [19M] recently broke up after dating for 15 months. We both felt like we were growing apart after spending all summer away from each other. We came to this conclusion after only 2 weeks of being together after that separation. I realized what a mistake this break up was and how much I still love her. I went to her place yesterday (we had been broken up for almost 2 weeks) and told her I thought we should get back together and all the reasons why. She said that we can't because she realized in those 2 weeks we were broken up that she had changed a lot for me and wasn't the same person anymore. Apparently I was too controlling. She also said she was happier than she had been in awhile (not sure how to take that). I also realized during the break that I wasn't a great boyfriend. I had always meant to change and be better, but never did because it was difficult and I never thought she would leave me. Now I'm motivated to change, and want to show her I can. I'm not only doing it for her, but for me as well. It needs to be done either way. I love her so much and just want her back. I would give anything to be with her. She also thinks that it's for the better this way, because her older brother went through the same thing and is now thankful that he didn't get back together with his ex. But it doesn't seem right to compare us to other relationships. We're different. I also talked to a friend who got back together with her ex boyfriend after breaking up for the same reason, and they are perfectly happy now. Problem is I can't really relay this information to my ex. What am I supposed to do to convince her we should be together?\nTL;DR:"}

IF.    \n* I am a 210lb, 5'10\", male, 29 yo.    \n    To begin with about 2 months ago I started doing SS, and then would do 15-30 minutes of interval runs on the treadmill right after.  2 weeks into the SS program I read about IF and thought, great, sounds perfect  I'll do that too.  I've been doing this \"regimen\" and have lost only about 3lbs.  However I've gone from Squatting 100bs to 180lbs, Benching 85lbs to 125lbs, Deadlifting 100lbs to 175lbs, and Pressing 85lbs to 95lbs.    \n    My clothes do fit slightly better and I can definitely feel the muscles in my legs as they are more pronounced.  I am pleased with the progress I've made in the strength department, but have also wanted to see some weight loss.      \n    That's where I thought IF could help...but I've delved deeper into and it seems that either I am supposed to give up the cardio on IF and just rely on lifting weights to lose weight, because essentially the cardio could be hurting my progress in strength and weight loss.  Or potentially I should give up IF and SS if my goal is to lose weight, since these are both tailored to gains in strength with IF more tailored to those who are already...lean.    \n    So, should I be giving up on IF and/or SS if my goal is to fit into smaller jeans and stick with a deficit of calories and cardio?  Or can I continue on SS and IF, without cardio, and expect to see weight loss in spite of the fact that I am 25%bf, so I can fit into those smaller jeans?\nTL;DR:"}

To my surprise, she calmly told me that I should get a girlfriend. Someone who can fill that void so that she's not burdened with it. I'd be lying if I hadn't thought about being with other women who could match up with me in bed, but to hear it come from my wife made it seem...strange. Has anyone been in this situation before? Even if you haven't, I'd appreciate some kind of advice on it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [32F] with my [35M] - how to talk about his family ring (my soon to be engagement ring) not being my style?\nPOST: My current boyfriend and I have talked about getting married, and he mentioned his grandma's ring would be his when she passed away and strongly implied that would be my engagement ring. He got home this morning from visiting his mom for the holiday this weekend (I had to work and couldn't go), and the bits and pieces he told me about their conversation has made me think this is a done deal.\n\nProblem is, the ring is totally not my style. At all. I never wear gold jewelry - in fact, I don't think I've ever owned a piece because I simply don't like it. A round diamond isn't my first choice, but that part I can get over.\n\nLet me be clear that I am very honored that he wants to give this to me, and I can tell it's important to him. But the fact is, since it's not my style I can't see myself ever wearing it, no matter how sentimental it is - especially given the fact that I don't really wear jewelry anyway - I never wear earrings or rings, and will sometimes just wear a simple diamond solitaire necklace.\n\nWithout sounding ungrateful, how can I talk about this with him? I'm fine with using the diamond, but would strongly prefer a different setting in white gold. I feel bad asking to \"use it for parts,\" and I know he would just buy me a new ring if it came down to him not wanting to wreck the family ring, but I really, really don't want to hurt his feelings. The heirloom ring isn't a money issue, it's a sentimental issue.\n\nI also want to be clear that I'm not gunning for a bigger ring or anything either - I like simple, understated jewelry. It's really just the gold band that's bothering me.\n\nWe have an amazing relationship with great communication, but I'm new to the \"family heirloom\" discussion and want to tread lightly. I know things like that can be a sensitive issue for some, so I want to make sure I approach this the right way so I don't upset him or his family.\nTL;DR:"}

We all get along pretty well and have lived together for 2 years. One of them, I'll call him Steven, has a pretty severe alcohol dependency. He has been one of my friends for a while and i have tried to talk to him about it on two occasions but i could tell he didn't want to talk about it so i dropped it. He used to drink a handle a weekend and I have even seen him drink a handle of Jim Beam in one day. I realized it was an severe issue when he woke up one morning after we had a few friends over, and he drank the remaining liquid in all the cups people left out the night before hoping he could get a buzz since he was out of alcohol. He goes out and does other things but when he is home or out with friends he is always drinking. He has recently told me he switched to drinking only beer. I figured he had a realization about the hard liquor and stopped drinking it, but i found 2 bottles in his closet(i wasn't spying on his stuff, i was getting an extra towel out of his closet). He comes home with a 6 pack every day and gets another one in the evening. His mother knows some about his problem and did suggest rehab but his parents divorced and nothing was ever done. I don't buy him any alcohol anymore and I try to drink around him as little as possible. I feel like no one, not even his girlfriend of 2 years, is going to do or say anything to help him. What the hell am I supposed to do in order to save my friend?\nTL;DR:"}

I used to work out an hour a day, but the results are the same now that I'm a bit stricter with my diet and have cut time off my workout.\n\nSo, Loseit, here is my question (and I do realize that it is a medical question, but I hate calling my doctor's office and being put on hold for a bajillion years with shitty elevator-waiting music):\n\n**How does low blood sugar affect your calorie count?**\n\nI've read several articles online that indicates that low blood sugar causes more calories to be burned. Well, that's all fine and dandy for non-diabetics; you're not going to go into insulin shock from a little low blood sugar. I might. In order for me to be able to be able to stand and walk and function properly, I have to drink half a gallon of juice and have a jar of peanut butter (a *bit* exaggerated, but not by much :/ ). It sucks because I can't just work out endlessly and feel fine. As soon as that low blood sugar hits, I have to hit the sugar.\nTL;DR:"}

Dan started acting weird and asking questions about the boy I was texting, and complaining about me using my phone because it's rude.  Later when I responded to a text he let out, \"please don't cheat on me.\"\n\nI was pretty shocked because being unfaithful to him is the last thing I would do, the dynamic of our relationship is very caring and giving. I reassured that I wouldn't hurt him like that. I said it was important to me that he trusts me and doesn't think I am the type of person who could betray someone they care about. He responded that he doesn't trust me, he doesn't trust anyone so I shouldn't take it personally, and I am guilty until proven innocent because girls he thought cared about him have cheated on him before. He said that he would always hate my guy friends but he wouldn't tell me about it if it upset me. I was very hurt by this reveal.\n\nIt was difficult for us to find common ground on our opinions of trust and friendships with the opposite sex. I have a lot of guy friends who I don't have romantic feelings for, although a few of them have made moves on me (which I always reject). I understand feeling jealous occasionally and I'm glad he is willing to talk to me, but I'm not going to give up my friends because he doesn't believe that I will be faithful to him (not that he asked me to do that, just said that me talking to boys makes him uncomfortable and he doesn't want me texting them when he's around).

We hit it off great and there was obviously mutual attraction. Unfortunately, she goes to school in a different state so we weren't able to see each other until Tuesday (she's home for the summer). Tuesday evening I took her to my house and we had sex. The sex was very awkward but also very steamy. I managed to get her off twice with my tongue and fingers (she claims that I was the first guy to have ever made her orgasm, big accomplishment for me since I'm not very experienced only having had one other partner a handful of times), but due to a combination of nervousness and excitement I had a lot of trouble maintaining an erection.   I took her home that night and she told me how great of a time she had and how ready she was to do it again. \nThe next day however was horrible. She was being incredibly short and distant while text messaging me. Eventually (against my better judgement) I decided to ask her what exactly she wanted from me. SHE WENT BERSERK. I called her on the phone and she told me to never call her again. So, I didn't call or reply and then she berated me because \"I don't even care\" I pointed out that her tirade was obviously conflicting and she replied that she enjoyed our sex the night before but that she needed space. I told her to call me when she was ready to talk again. We went a day and a half without speaking (we've spoken at least once a day for a month) until I finally gave into my anxiety and called her. I explained to her that I have very strong feelings her and that I felt bad because I feel like I fucked up something that could turn into a good thing very prematurely. She told me that she has feelings towards me and she isn't done with me but that she needs \"time\". We haven't contacted each other since.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm currently working this summer and will be able to save at least $1500, I have the option to save $2000 but that would basically make me miserable.\n\nI'm assuming that I'll be able to save at least $2000 each of the next two summers barring unforeseen expenses.  I'll hopefully be able to get a part-time job during the school year and put away about half of what I make into savings.\n\nHopefully I'll have about $7-8000 in savings by the time I graduate.  It doesn't really seem like much but I'm hoping it will help me out while I'm looking for a job.\n\nThere's a few things I need to note. I'm currently with a girl that I've been dating for almost 2.5 years, and even though there's no way I can really know this for sure, there's a fair chance we're getting married.  And if we do get married, it'll be soon after we graduate.  If that happens, we'll be living alone and paying for things ourselves.  I don't know whether or not our parents would help us out, but I'd like to be completely financially independent, and I'm going to plan for that.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are both very fortunate in the fact that we don't really have to pay for much right now.  We'll both be getting out of college debt free.\n\nFinally, I'm a music major (I may be adding business as another major) and my girlfriends a european studies major.  Honestly not sure how well these will help us after we graduate.\nTL;DR:"}

They have a four-year-old.\nPOST: My boyfriend and I live in a shotgun-style apartment with eight apartments in the building. We live in a good neighborhood --- poor, but with lots of families and everyone is friendly and kind. The neighbors I'm worried about are the ones whose apartment shares a wall with the hallway that runs the length of our apartment. They're a man and a woman, late twenties to early thirties, and a boy who's probably four at most -- her son, not his, we think.\n\nA couple of months ago, they started having terrible screaming matches at all hours of the night and sometimes midday. Whenever we heard them start up, my boyfriend and I would get very quiet and listen carefully to make sure no one was being hurt. It started as worrisome and quickly became juvenile and annoying. At one point she followed him out to the dumpsters under the windows on our side of the building to continue berating him. It was honestly pathetic.\n\nMy level of concern went from passively annoyed to seriously troubled this afternoon, though, when we witnessed him buying drugs that were definitely not pot from some dude in a car in front of our building. I know he knows that we saw him, but I'm starting to feel unsafe. Between the fighting and the drugs, I'm starting to wonder if I shouldn't put in a call to child protective services or the police. But I'm also nervous that they'll figure out it was us who put in a call and try to fuck with us.\n\nWhat should I do? Can I even do anything?

Let's call her Ashley. \n\nOur relationship started off weird. We were good friends in a tightly knit friend-group who then became FWB. Moving from that friendship level to a romantic level was a bit awkward, but we both really wanted it. Around the same time, a mutual friend(let's call him Andy), who she is much closer to than I am and cares about dearly, told her he had feelings for her. Ashley didn't reciprocate because she had feelings for me. \n\nThis was about 5 months ago. Ashley is my GF now, we're pretty close, our friends all know we're together, etc. \n\nEarlier on, a couple of months ago, she had admitted to wanting to keep our relationship low-key to protect the feelings of Andy. That was a bit off-putting, but whatever I get it - friendships usually last longer than relationships and she didn't want to hurt his feelings. But, as of a month or so ago, she said she was over that. \n\nBut still, whenever Andy is around, she'll act like her and I aren't anything more than friends. Last night, for instance, Andy and I were studying in the same room. Ashley pops in, says hi to Andy, asks him a question, and then leaves without saying a word to me. And then later that night, Ashley pulled me aside and waited until the coast was clear to give me a peck. I'm not crazy about PDA, and I honestly don't care whether or not she displays PDA - it was more so about the fact that she felt like she *had* to hide her affection for me since Andy was near. This was a bit annoying considering the fact that all of our friends, Andy included, knows we're together.\n\nIt just bothers me that my girlfriend chooses to not act like my girlfriend seemingly in order to not step on someone else's toes.\nTL;DR:"}

He thinks this makes me feel good about myself, but it doesn't. I live in a place where over half the population is Asian, and I am white. I've always felt odd and out of place, and now this just makes me feel even worse. We've only been dating for 3 months but we've been good friends since mid 2012. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

We have been with new girl for about 2 months and spent a few nights together and are starting to get closer.  We plan to take her to dinner tonight and some drink and the 'next step', she is (32f).  What should I get her/both girls to make them feel special but not to clingy/desperate?  I thought about flowers but that seems to cliche and jealousy is something I am worried about so I would want to get both a gift right?  Dont want the wife pissed at me because I got gf something but not her lol.  I realize this is unique which is why I come to the relationship experts of the internet.\nTL;DR:"}

We've spoken on Skype several times, and I'm quite sure that he's genuine, given that I know which school he goes to, and he publicly won a national competition earlier this month, so I've been able to confirm his details.\n\nWe first got to know each other via a discussion about online roleplay (of the sexual variety which I admit, is very random), but happened to have a lot in common. We regularly try roleplaying, and through that, I feel closer to him. We've had a few minor disagreements, mainly centered around him making jokes at inappropriate times, but nothing that has caused me to lose interest. \n\nI have quite acute anxiety, so there have been instances where I've worried about him sharing explicit conversations we've had with people I know, but he's assured me that he has no reason to do so. He's told me that he has feelings for me which I reciprocate.\n\nHe's visiting my city in the next few weeks, and I'm slightly skeptical as to whether I should take this any further.

First time posting here so sorry if I forgot some things.\n\n I read a lot of stuff online concerning this, I saw the 25 to 35% of your income tip and more. I do feel however, that my situation isn't standard so much, bear with me. First, I live in a heavy taxed province in Canada (you could easily guess which). \n\nI am a software dev fresh out of school, iv been working for a full year already, and make 44k per year, and take home about 35.5k of that. I am lucky enough to have a great car and absolutely zero debt on my head. I have about 20k in low-risk investments. And my check account is sitting at about 6-7k \n\nNow, I currently live in a small apartment near the university (which means higher rents around here) that costs me 670$ monthly. It is crazy small, I'm moving out this summer.\n\nI have a car and there is a new neighborhood which would put me at a 15 min work commute, and there is a LOT of brand new apartment buildings and condos. There doesnt seem to be lower end housing available aroubd there but, the prices for condos and apartments are near what they are in the cheapest neighborhoods so I started looking there.\n\nHere's the thing, if i take 30% of my net income, I would hence be looking for apartments around 875 monthly. Heres the thing.. There is a lot of those around they are bigger than mt small apartment but still meh, but I saw 3 apartments that I would LOVE. They are bigger, they have crazy open space, nice bathrooms, lots of extra stuff but are all around 1k monthly.\n\n I'v asked around in my friends they are all either 1) paying more than 30% of their net income or 2) paying really cheap and in apartments they dont like. \n\nIt sounds like paying 900 on rent would be the wisest thing to do, but I'm having trouble paying this for an apartment I don't really like when I could be in am awesome place for 150$ more monthly.\n\nWould really appreciate some insight guys!

We had gone up and spent the night, and returned home the next day around 8 or so (I had driven the entire trip). Knowing I had to go to work the next night, and not wanting to be awake 1000 times, I doped myself up on allergy meds and waited to pass out. Now, I love my dog, and I missed him, he's a spoiled little dude (Boston bulldog, roughly 25ish lbs) and he often sleeps in bed with me, although usually only when I am sleeping during the day. But I missed him on our trip, so I figured I would let him snuggle while I was enjoying my heavily medicated sleep. \n\nDuring the night....? morning.....? not sure exactly when it was, I started having a really odd dream. At some point in the dream, I am being followed down an alley to my apartment door by a super creepy guy. I manage to get in the door and am leaning against it with all my power to keep creepy guy from coming in the apartment but it just isn't working! Hands are coming in my apartment door so I resort to the last option......I lean down and chomp onto creepy dream guy's hand. \n\nAnd I am promptly woken up by a BYORK!!!!! and a smallish dog levitating across the bed to the complete opposite side. Barely awake I realize what I had done.....in my dream I had bitten the hand coming in my door......IRL I had just chomped down on my dogs foot as he slept next to me. So here I am, roughly 3am, trying to calm my dog down and convince him to come lay down again, meanwhile picking dog hair out of my teeth. And somehow, SOMEHOW, my SO slept through the entire thing. Thankfully my dog was ok (besides being a bit wary of me while I sleep now) and besides me feeling like a total asshat, I think me and the dog are still friends.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been dating for over 5 months. We are perfect for each other. She means the world to me, and we are pretty serious. \n\nBut there was this one time before we were going to sleep and we were talking that she asked me--kiddingly--when the last time I had masturbated was. And I didn't want to lie to her, so I told her it had been that weekend, and the fact that it had been the first time in a month. And when I told her this, I could tell she was hurt, and I felt terrible. And for me, there is no sensation that hurts worse than knowing I hurt her feelings. I tried to tell her how she was the only girl I'd ever want to do stuff with, but she still seemed so hurt. \n\nSo the next day I promised her that I would never masturbate to porn again, and she responded by saying I could do whatever I want. I realize now that I may have made a mistake because we aren't always able to do sexy things (college) and we will live several hours away from each other for 3 months this summer (also because of college). I've been good so far, I haven't masturbated to porn and it's been over 2 months since. And it's not like I was a porn addict or something, I looked at it once a blue moon. What should I do? I don't want to break my promise, but most importantly I don't want to hurt her feelings.\nTL;DR:"}

See, a little while ago, my BF asked me out of the blue if I didn't really like him smoking pot. He's a decently heavy user and I'm mega light, probably around five times a year total, so I'm not totally against it. I told him that I didn't really like it, but didn't really care that much in general and that he didn't have to change his behavior. He got really sulky and moody and acted like I'd told him I'd break up with him if he didn't quit cold turkey, but he insisted that he was going to stop because he didn't want to do something I didn't like. He even made a big show out of giving his pipe, stash can, and all his pot to his little brother. I told him that I'd stop drinking, too, since I found it only fair to give up something that really upset him, and we went from there.\n\nWell, on my part, I haven't had any liquor or drugs since then, even at parties. I assumed he was doing the same. Periodically he would even make comments about missing it and how his smoke buddy didn't really understand. This weekend he had to go on a trip out of town and packed a backpack and suitcase, and forgot his phone charger in his car last minute. I told him I'd get it, but couldn't find his keys, so I looked in his backpack. Well, there I found everything he'd given his brother, plus a little extra more. I asked him about why he had it when he'd said he quit and gave everything away, and he said that it was for a friend that he was going on the trip with, and not for him. I feel like I don't have trust in him because I look at that as the oldest excuse in the book. Should I drop it, and just trust that he's not lying, or am I right to have doubts here and really should talk to him more about it?\nTL;DR:"}

I hate to describe someone as crazy but she uses that term to to describe herself and has some pretty glaring red flags. For one she does drugs (coke) and I'm about a year sober (thus the username). She has low self esteem. I met her at last call at a bar for example! She cried for a little bit that night then latched onto me and has been texting me like crazy. Lots of photos too. When I say \"falling for\" I am ushually kind of emotionally distant about sex. I am actually feeling feelings for this girl and it's scaring me.\n\nI grew up in an abusive household and I wonder if this is just what feels comfortable for me? The chaos. I just feel like I have to fake being \"normal\" when I date girls who have their shit more together. I've been on the dating scene for like six months after a long relationship and haven't met anyone special. This girl has been on my mind a lot and she is also sending me a lot of texts that make it sound like she is equally interested. Oh and she has a kid as well, which is something that is kinda crazy for me. I've been really careful to avoid having children until I get a better job and find the right person so it's a little scary. What the hell do I do? Dump her even though I want her? Is this how girls who go for the \"bad boy\" feel? Ahhhh what's happening to me?!\nTL;DR:"}

I was also filling it out at 1 in the morning. One of the programs I was going to do is computer science. At this university that I was applying for, they had computer science at all 3 of their campuses.\n\nThis is where it starts to begin.\n\nI went searching under the science tag and when I found it, I realized that it was for the campus that was 2 hours away from me, and naturally I didn't want to fuck that up so I went back searching. When I found the right campus, I looked under Applied Science and engineering think it was there. Saw the word computer and I quickly added the program, finished my application and went to sleep. In the next couple of weeks, I'm getting a bunch of university emails since I applied to two other universities as well. \n\nNow a couple of days ago I got a email from their engineering admissions and didn't really think about until reading it. As I was reading it, I was thinking, \"Wait I didn't apply to computer engineering, I applied to computer science.\" After looking at my application, it said I applied for computer engineering. Realizing my mistake, I log onto the application website and found out I clicked on computer engineering instead of computer science, and computer science was under the arts and science tab.  \n\nNow I got to complete a bunch of forms and do chemistry in night school if I want to be considered in the program.\nTL;DR:"}

We hung out on the weekends (we were both in the Bay Area, 2~ hours away from each other) due to work and school responsibilities. We've only been officially dating for almost 2 months.\n\nDue to economic reasons, I had to leave the Bay Area (I work in tech) and move across the country back home.\n\nDuring my last month in the Bay Area, my girlfriend and I spent a lot of time together, we went to Pride, etc. While it was a lot of fun, it was also sad. \n\nI told her well in advance that I was moving across the country. We are both very sad about it. She offered to drive me to the airport the day I moved.  \n\non the way, she started crying and kept asking me if I think we should break up or stay together, or take time to think about it. As we pulled up to curbside checkin, she told me that she loves me. I told her that I love her.\n\nWhile from time to time I do express and articulate my emotions and experiences with this, she does also. And while I think it's healthy to do so, I'm concerned that this situation is causing us to hurt more than it already does. \n\nFor example, yesterday she called me and told me she was really sad. I heard her crying and hyperventilating on the phone. We both cried on the phone, and talked about it. at the end of the call, she told me that she still loves me. ( I said it back) I also felt (and still do feel) bad about this situation, and how it's causing us to feel sad.  \n\nI care about her a lot, and it's not fair for either of us to keep experiencing this pain. \n\nAlso: unrelated to dating, but one of my parents is ill, I haven't shared with them the above situation.\nTL;DR:"}

Note, my wages aren't withheld so at next tax season, uncle sam is going to take between $13-$18k\n\nMy employer has me working as a contractor, so I have the potential to set up a small business (LLC, S corp, or something similar) in order to have the ability to contribute to an individual 401k. \n\nHowever, I'm wondering what the major advantage of an individual 401k is verses simply holding the amount I would contribute in other funds. I'm aware that I would then get taxed on the income, but I feel like the tax on the income would be less than the tax would be after the 401k matures.\n\nAdditionally, I don't plan on remaining a contractor for much longer than 3-5 years as I'll eventually need healthcare for myself/my future wife/children.

Unfortunately, her birth mother is a piece of shit, so due to her smoking/drinking copiously while pregnant, my sister was born slightly autistic (I think, we never figured out exactly what it was). \n\nWell, shit happens and then more shit happens, and we are unable to care for her anymore. There was nothing else we could do, so she went back to live with her birth mother about seven years ago. Naturally, we have to pay child support for her and naturally, her mother refuses to actually spend the money on her, opting instead to treat her younger daughter as a spoiled princess for God knows what reason, because that kid's a little bitch.\n\nThis is AskReddit, though, so here's my question/predicament. As I said before, my sister's not very good at math (she failed the Texas standardized tests a number of times and was held back at least once) so she's still in high school despite the fact that she should have graduated last month. Somehow, the terms of child support dictate until she graduates, so her mother can just keep holding her back and raking in the cash (over $1k per month). That's not even the best part, though. I found out yesterday that her mother just kicked her out of the house and told her not to come back, but WE STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR CHILD SUPPORT. As long as she's still in high school, we're paying the mother a comfy sum and it will cost at least 5x what we're paying her to go to court and fight over it. I find it very, very hard to believe that it's legal to have to pay child support to someone who's not even supporting the child anymore. Is there anything we can do while avoiding a costly legal battle?\nTL;DR:"}

But she is getting back with him.\n\nI just feel helpless because every girl I am talking too in that stage of a relationship (Hate this stage)  has either an ex who is in the wings of winning a girl back, or she was interested in someone else before I came into the picture.  \n\nI am batting a solid 0-2 right now, and my confidence just feels shot.  And yes, I am improving myself hitting the gym, working on my career with job interviews and such.

I don't need to hear to I'm beta bullshit (sorry some people say this and its annoying) cause I am not.

We will be engaged in a couple months, just before graduation.  \n\nI just got accepted to medical school in the suburbs of a large city.  My boyfriend got a job in the same city.  My parents wanted me to continue living with them, but I knew I'd never get to see my boyfriend much if I did that, so we're going to scrimp and pinch for a little apartment.  \n\nI realize med school is going to be a huge time commitment.  Thankfully my school doesn't have mandatory attendance, but my current plan was to treat studying/classes like a full time job (roughly 10-12 hours a day, less if I don't go to class but more if I do considering commute).  My boyfriend is about to start a high stress job.  I realize chores will have to be split, should I do more of them since I'm not working?  I'm also wondering how to go about time together.  Neither of us have any friends or social life, so there will be time to spend together, but is a date night once a week irresponsible considering my studies?\n\nI realize talking to him is the best course of action, but I just wanted to hear from anyone that might have done this before.\nTL;DR:"}

After this I calmly told her that I needed time to think and told her we would speak again later.\n\nI have not talked to her since but have made plans to meet her soon.  At first I was just angry but then I starting giving this some thought and asked myself what I would need to do to save the relationship and whether or not it was worth it.  Then I just started crying and realised the relationship was over.  I have prepared some notes where I explain all of this to her in person and I feel pretty prepared for all if this.\n\nThe hard part is that when she told me about the affair she told me she was disgusted with herself, the reason is that she has some masochistic fetishes that I have only been partly able to help her with (I am really uncomfortable with any type of violence even if it is a fantasy) and the affair was basically a result of her trying to fulfil those needs.  Of course it is normal for her to feel bad about lying to me but I do not think her fetishes are disgusting and she should not feel bad about them, I want to explain this to her in some way and also just make sure she will be alright in the end.  I will tell her that she deserves happiness because she is fundamentally a good person, but I do not know how to get about explaining to her that I am not disgusted by her fetishes and she should not feel disgusted or feel like a bad person just because she has those fantasies.  Can someone who can related to those fetishes explain to me how I can convey this message?\nTL;DR:"}

I had been dating my girlfriend at the time for roughly a year, and the time came where we decided to finally have sex. The big day was set for the upcoming weekend.\n\nA couple days prior to the big day, I had a hockey game and went over to her house after. The story begins when I forgot a change of underwear. I shower up after my game and since I didn't bring a change of underwear, I had to go commando in jeans to her house.\n\nSo I get to her house and we begin to watch a movie in the basement, things start to heat up a bit as we start making out. We start dry humping the hell out of each other while we're making out. As she gets on top of me, I get this weird feeling on my donger that is not very pleasant. But like most horny teenagers I don't let it get to me and continue on. I'm leaving her house later that night and its quite uncomfortable to walk. I get into my car, turn the light on and take a look at what's wrong with my dick. Why does it hurt so bad? Turns out, the combination of dry humping, and wearing no underwear under jeans gave me 3 different spots of rug burn (jean burn? I dont know..). The first thing on my mind was oh shit.. I'm supposed to be finally getting laid in a couple days.. whats gonna happen.. aww shit. \n\nFast forward to the big day. Burns still present and painful as ever. We're at her house, start off by making out in the hot tub and the pool. Hurry off to the shower to rinse off the chlorine in our horny stupor. We're in the shower and starts to jerk me off, thankfully she hasn't seen the burns on my dick. If you've ever irritated a rug burn on your arm, multiply that by 50 and that's how I felt. Shortly after, we head off to the bedroom where I slip on a condom and hope to god the sex doesn't hurt (for me atleast). Praise be to those condoms... no pain on my end, and the girlfriend never knew I had the rug burns\nTL;DR:"}

Enjoy The Fail.\nPOST: When I was 12, there was this guy who ALWAYS bugged the shit out of me and my friends in school, like copying our answers on tests and shit breaking our pencils and ripping our papers. So here's what we did. One day, me and my friends, plus the asshat (AH) were in the Woodshop class. We had this REALLY important test that determined our Woodshop grade for that term. If you failed it, you got a D, which was a fail. If you got middle, you got a C. If you got 75%, you got a B, and if you got 95% and up you got an A. We're allowed to help each other in this test, weirdly. So AH is really stressed out, and we're there getting 99% of the answers right (as said by our Woodshop teacher) and he's there not having a single thing written down. AH has nobody to help him, he's on his own because he hates help, but he's so desperate this time. He asks us: \"GUYS! HELP! CAN YOU GIVE ME THE ANSWERS? I'LL LOSE ALL MY STUFF IF I FAIL!\" and we're there discussing it. I come up with the idea of giving him the wrong answers, and we all agree. So we feed him ALL the wrong answers, making 100% of it lies. He's so happy, but little does he know what we did. A few weeks later, he runs up to us and says \"WHAT THE HELL GUYS?! I FAILED THE TEST! YOU GUYS GAVE ME ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS THOUGH!\" and we're all about to burst out laughing, but instead I say \"Weird, maybe you should see (insertwoodshopteachersnamehere) and ask them about it.\" Which he does. He walks into school, goes to the Woodshop teacher, and asks him why he got a D even though all of his answers were right. The woodshop teacher asked him how he knew, and the AH says he asked us. AH then gets a 3-week detention, studying all the answers. Hahaha!\nTL;DR:"}

She is friends with my attractive female friend and I am asking my friend to take her to lunch or dinner or Starbucks or whatever to sort of probe her for her interest in me, as I do not have her phone number myself. \n\nThis, however, seems to be extremely difficult to arrange between them and I honestly don't expect it to happen anytime soon. I don't like this situation I have where I can't talk to her myself, but I feel like if I found her on facebook or hit her up on twitter it would be 'creepy' or 'too much too fast.'\n\nI am torn on what to do. If I let my friend suggest that we get together, then I have the friend's seal of approval and she might trust me more or be more eager to see me, but I am impatient and if I find her online I risk coming off as creepy.\nTL;DR:"}

How/where could I look for him via internet?\nPOST: Hello, Reddit.\n\nHere goes\u2026 My dad's brother left Europe to work in Australia in 1978, long before I was born. During the time he was in his early 20's. My dad and the rest of the brothers escorted him to the airport, watched him take off and never heard from him again\u2026\n\nLater on my relatives have tried to search for him in different ways \u2013 through Australian authorities, other relatives living in Australia, Red Cross, etc. without success. \nWe know he got to Australia. We know he had a job waiting there. Other than that, the authorities at least won't tell anything. All we're left are the immigration selection documents and a bunch of photos taken at the airport.\n\nI gather there are two possible scenarios; a) he somehow died and went missing or b) he went missing willingly and had kept under the radar. Nobody knows why he would've done such a thing, though. Others think the authorities would've told had he died. It's been a long time since and we understand there's good change he's passed away but many of us still stay positive. The 70's were a lot different time and you probably could've disappeared if you wanted to.\n\nNow, I know the internet is a powerful tool and at this point, I turn to you and your advice. How would one use the internet to look for him? I don't think creating a Facebook page would do squat but I don't really know where to look from\u2026 Please help.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/cats\nTITLE: Do cats from the same litter mourn the loss of one another?\nPOST: I never had cats growing up but when I moved at age 23, I was living with someone whose cat had kittens. I wasn't planning to keep them but fell in love and couldn't let 2 of them go (the 3rd was being kept by the family).  The 2 are brothers and were never separated even one night since 2004 when they were born.\n\nLast Thursday, one of them finally lost his battle with kidney failure.  After 3 days in the emergency vet hospital, they said there wasn't anything else they could do and sent me home with him to enjoy the last few days before having him checked again to see if it was time to put him to sleep.  He came home on Tuesday night and his follow-up appointment was Thursday morning and they said he just couldn't fight any longer. \n\nHis brother has now been extra cuddly - until a couple of months ago, he was always his own little free-spirit, would only let you pet him when HE decided fit and didn't like soft places (like the bed/couch) but would always sleep on tables or dressers.  In the last couple of months, he's gotten increasingly more affectionate to the point that he now sleeps in the bed every night.  Since his brother past, he's continuing this trend, perhaps even more (he's curled up on my arm as I type this).\n\nI'm trying to figure out if cats can sense that a sibling has passed?  Do they mourn?  Is there anything I can do to help him with the loss?  Or anything I should be worried about?  I've just never had cats so I'm trying to make sure I do whatever I can to help him through this time as I know he's been my comfort since losing his brother.\nTL;DR:"}

I bought a gym pass. And actually went only 2 days later!! I was so happy to see that not only was it not filled with muscular, fit, beautiful people, I wasn't the heaviest person in there! I also wasn't the only person who didn't know what they were doing! loving the confidence that I have to go back!!\nTL;DR:"}

He would even get upset when I stopped texting for the night, so we started ending convos with \"goodnight\". \n\nOver the last month, I've noticed his texts are becoming more infrequent and longer time in between (maybe 8 hours to a whole day etc.). He also stopped calling me. \nLast week, I sent him a text asking him a question. I waited the whole day without a response. The next day, I sent him another text just in case. No response. The day after, I just suspected he \"ghosted\" so I sent him one last message telling him \"hey. Let's end things on a good terms, okay? Please don't ghost\" \nAfter four days of no response, I get a text from him saying he wasn't ghosting but feels pressured to respond and he just doesn't know what to say most of the time. It makes him want to recoil because he feels forced into it. \nI haven't responded. I don't know if I will. I know I sound really insecure but it's hard to go from him wanting to talk with me everyday to barely any texting at all. I'm assuming he lost interest so I'm thinking of leaving him alone.

Problem is her bf is moving in with her/us at the end of the month.\n\nThey've been together for three or so years now, and she's maybe been seeing her boss for about a month I'm guessing.

This just started happening recently and that's when I started getting suspicious. Now, I understand that this really isn't my business, but her bf is moving in with us at the end of the month to replace the roommate we'll be losing. If he finds out while he's here and moves out, none of us will be able to afford the house anymore and I really don't want to move as I love the place.\n\nWhat do I do?? Both of them are really good friends of mine and I don't want to intrude, but if this ends badly I don't want to be taken down with it. Should I talk to her/her bf or should I just stay out of it? I mean, I really don't have any solid evidence. Just the fact that he comes over late all the time, and one night I spotted them out the window and their faces looked close together but I honestly couldn't see much else. If I were dating her I would not be comfortable with this behavior.\n\nSo sorry for formatting or grammar or anything. It's late and I'm on my mobile.

She was going to college, and I stayed home to work and wait on my decision of what to study in college. \n\nDuring winter break, she comes home and I decide to break up with her due to the fact that it was a toxic relationship.

I havent talked to her since. She is starting a new job tomorrow. So for old time sake, I text her by saying \"Good luck tomorrow.\" It's been like 6 hours. No response from her.\nI just wanted to keep my chivalry and have a clean mutual break up. But I guess not? maybe she hates me cause I deleted her fb?\n\nI just want to ask you guys.

She's a 15 year old dog. Her name is Nala. She's been alone almost all her life, and we've had play dates throughout the year. There have been dogs she gets along with and dogs she hasn't.\n\nWe recently got a Siberian husky at 13 weeks and he is now 6 months and he is hyperactive! His name is Charlie. He loves other dogs and is friendly. He's a challenge and destroys everything in his path but he's so lovable. \n\nSo my dogs fight everyday and what seems like all day. They're always fighting in the backyard over everything! If Charlie wants to play, Nala fights. If Nala is around Charlie's food, he starts pawing her and then the fight happens. They're constantly bickering at each other for what seems like hours at a day. I know Charlie loves Nala because when we walk them together, Charlie cries and whines because he wants to be next to her the whole time. Nala isn't phased by anything. I think the problem might be that Nala simply doesn't like Charlie. What should I do? How can I get them to stop fighting?\nTL;DR:"}

He said he would walk me home (it's only about a 5 minute walk, we're in college) but it was snowing so I thought it was really nice. After walking me home, he hugged me and I said something like \"oh did i give you my number earlier?\" and he said \"no, i left my phone at home but let me give you mine.\" \n\nSo when I got inside my house, I texted him something like \"hey its ___. thanks for walking me back in the snow!\" I got no answer, so I thought maybe he had passed out drunk....but then the next morning, I still had no answer and haven't gotten a text from him since.\n\nHe is good friends with my friend's boyfriend, so I will DEFINITELY be seeing him again. I don't want to make things awkward by texting him again, but I also think he's cool and would like to hang out again. Should I wait it out, or trying sending him one more text?

It's a waste of my time and their time. But if I see an awesome ad for something relevant to me, e.g. a cool new TV show or yummy food or something, then there's at least a chance it could help me out.\n\nAnother example: when I'm on Facebook, them showing me ads for Farmville would be totally irrelevant to me. Thankfully they don't; instead I see ads for things I care about, like ads for concerts when bands I like come to town. 99% of the time I ignore these ads, but occasionally they'll pique my interest to the point that I'll click through.

When we first started dating he was very upfront about him being an alcoholic, but as I did not have much experience or knowledge about the disease at the time I decided to go ahead and start dating him anyway.  At first, things were great as they usually are at the beginning, but a couple of months in the disease starts to show itself.  At first it was just a couple of isolated incidents, but then that started to spiral out of control.  Fast forward to today and he is in rehab trying to get help, but I feel like a lot of damage has been done, and I don't know if we can repair our relationship at this point.  Not all of the damage done has been by him; I haven't been the nicest person either when he drinks.  I do love him, but is that enough?  \n  \nOne major complication is that currently I live with him and his parents and cannot support myself financially to move out until December (currently I'm student teaching which does not pay nor does it leave much time to have an outside job).  I do have some friends that said that I could move in with them if I need, but again I don't know if I'm ready to take that step.  I feel very conflicted because I don't want it to seem like I am simply staying with him to have a place to live, but on the other hand things are very different from what they used to be.  \n  \nAny help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nTL;DR:"}

If this isn't, then please send me to the right place to post. \n\n18 year old male, here.\n\nTo preface this, I am in no way homosexual and I do not have anything against homosexuals.\n\nIt started around four years ago when I was a sophomore in high school, when a rumor started spreading that I had sex with one of my (former) friends, who turned out to be gay. At first, I thought the rumor was a joke but soon came to see that everyone thought it was true.\n\nGranted, I have had two.. semi.. sexual experiences with males. The first, being with the guy that I was accused of having \"sex\" with. During truth or dare one night at my house he dared me to kiss him and I did. Grossed me out going into it and afterward, but I didn't think that it was a big deal. I didn't like it, it affirmed my attraction to women.\n\nA few months/year later (around age 13) I performed (and had performed on me) a blow job, on another one of my friends. I was not attracted to him sexually, or at all, but late one night he started to unzip my pants and I thought I would let things run their course. Neither of us finished (thankfully) and it only lasted about 30 seconds each, then we went to bed and never spoke of it again.\n\nMy point is, after these experiences, I still do not consider myself gay. I have never been attracted to a male, yet I still get accused/called gay quite frequently.\n\nFor the past few years I've been extremely depressed; I have no friends, no girlfriend, no happiness in my job, etc.. And I think this leads me to be more in touch with my sensitive side and emotions. I don't know why people think I'm gay.\nTL;DR:"}

We had agreed to look for jobs in similar cities and whoever got a better opportunity, we would move there. Me pushing her into finding a job and leaving home has caused stress in the relationship. Recently she was just offered a job traveling to conventions all over the world for free and being paid for it. This would essentially allow her to live anywhere. Instead she has her mind set on living in a single location (because she likes it) and has pressured me into a finding a job there.

But she will literally run a brush over it like twice and call it a day (which just doesn't work very well for black women with natural hair).\n\nAnd the way she dresses when we go out in public can be embarrassing  One of the worst things ever seen her do is wear a hoodie with spots and the wrist all chewed up from her dog, some dress pants with a hole in the thigh, and some converse shoes covered in mud spots all at the same time. \n\nNow of course she doesn't do these things 100% of the time but it could be like 2 or 3 times a week, around our friends, peers, and colleagues. When you combine the nails thing, the hair thing, and the clothes thing it kind of makes me loose my attraction to her and can be embarrassing.\n\nI want to ask her to present herself nicer but without making her feel bad about herself or making myself look like an asshole.

I believe things are pretty serious, I've met her parents and friends; she's met my friends and about to meet my parents.\n\nOkay now here's the problem. We were going through her old photos and I noticed she has a ton of saved photos of her and her ex bf of 3 years. We're talking albums here. When I tried to view them in a teasing/curious way, she responded back in a cute nooo and took her phone back. I just shrugged it off and played it cool. She was single for 2 full years before she met me. From what she has told me about her ex is that he was uncaring, verbally abusive and a cheater..which was the final straw of her breaking up with him.\n\nI'm thinking if it's been 2 full years and if he was such a prick, wouldn't you have deleted those photos the moment you broke up? I have ZERO saved photos of my exes, even the ones that ended on good terms.\nTL;DR:"}

He would look at me exclusively and straight into my eyes when he was talking, even though my friend standing next to me is far prettier, and he generally seemed extra smiley or whatever. \n\nAnyway, throughout the night I just got a different sort of vibe from him, almost instinctive, that he liked me. I know people usually rely on \"signs\" though, so here were some that I realized later might be significant?\n\nWhen we were all playing cards together, I noticed that when someone cracked a joke, he would look at me first when everyone laughed. \n\nOne time I turned my head to laugh at something and turned back to find that he was staring me straight in the eyes, which made me super embarrassed so I looked away immediately. I'm shy, so I didn't check the rest of the night to see if it was happening again.\n\nLater, when I had to leave early, he was pointedly staring down straight at the ground while everyone was telling me goodbye... sort of weird/awkward?

When the middle child (around 4 or 5) whined at the counter for a sticker book the mom told her she had money and could get it because she had her card. The little girl was like \"where my card at?\" and the mom handed it to her. I was like o.0 ok... but since the charge was only for $1.06 and I had told the children multiple times not to touch things or not to run behind my counter and the women did nothing, I figured it would be pointless. She handed me a YMCA card that served as her ID and the card went through. When I tried to hand the card to the mother with the receipt to sign she was like \"no, that's her card\". So I handed it to the child and made her illegibly sign the receipt while I had about 4 people in line meeting my confused looks with confused looks of their own. \n\nI read on credit card websites and it said no one under 18 can be issued a credit card as it's a legal document, but the child can be issued a card in their name on the parent's account and the money all goes to the same place.. so maybe that's it.

I apologize, and hope you can overlook that to help me with my problem.\n\nA few months ago, I found out that my husband, father of my children, and best friend, of almost ten years has been cheating on me. Since then, I've been in limbo. I can't seem to make a decision. I've made lists, I've written an entire book on my feelings- but I change my mind daily. I'm terrified to make a definite decision. Most days, I pretend it never happened, and pretend I have this happy life with a loving husband- and, it makes me not want to leave. I argue with myself it was a one time mistake, and this is still the man I adore. Then, the next day he's late coming home from work, or wants to go out with friends, and I think he's still cheating and am fully prepared to leave him. Some days I still love him, but others I feel like I'm married to a stranger.\n   I am terrified to make a permanent decision, and when I think I do, I seem to change my mind and throw myself back into indecisiveness. I've tried making pros/cons list, I've written nearly two notebooks of my feelings, tried to 'go with the flow' and see how it turns out. I keep telling myself I'm putting off making a hasty decision, or an emotional one while pregnant. \n   I haven't told anyone (I'm not close with my family, and I've lost touch with nearly all my friends, not that I was that popular to begin with.) I've thought about therapy, but I'm not great at pouring my heart out (non-anonymously). As soon as I make a decision that I feel I'm sticking to, I change my mind and the merry go 'round continues.

I was extremely excited to talk to her as I have no friends where I live now. My birthday comes to an end and all I get is a text saying \"happy bday\". We haven't spoken on the phone or seen each other since. \n  \nShe texts me a week later informing me she has found the love of her life and couldn't be happier. A month later she also informs me that she is pregnant and fully intends on raising their child together. Hearing this made things much worse for me, this was a girl I loved deeply, only two months went by and she's already forgotten about me. Meanwhile I can't even get a girl to look at me.\nTL;DR:"}

At one point she said something about not usually drinking, but if she wasn't tipsy she wouldn't have been able to come up and talk to me like she did. At this point I realized it was a little more than friendly conversation, but I empathized with what she was doing because I've been in that same situation, and would have felt badly now not being friendly.

After the number exchange she went in and kissed me on the cheek. The thing is, I think she was going for an actual kiss and I moved my face away from it, but I'm not sure, and I feel really embarassed about it.

He's also a Redditor, so I'm just going to leave it at that, except to say that we are really compatible, and he has no problem sharing most aspects of his life with me, including introducing me to all his friends and family.\n\nBut I'm technically his mistress, and a really selfish part of me hates that he has to be so concerned about his wife's well-being at this point. For instance, if his friends tag us in a photo on Facebook, he'll untag himself so as not to upset her. (They are not friends anymore but have a lot of mutual friends.) \n\nHe says he wants to keep things out of the online realm for at least six months to give her time to get over things, which I find equally admirable and maddening. \n\nI know it's different because they are married, but I was with me ex for the same number of years, and we broke up around the same time, and I couldn't give two rats' asses what he thinks about me and my relationships. \n\nI guess it doesn't help that his wife isn't  very stable. Although the divorce was her idea, she's not handling it well. She already broke three of his windows, one of which after she found out about me.\n\nAm I being really immature about this? It's not like I want to make our relationship Facebook official right now. I'm comfortable taking it slow while being exclusive. But it does make me worry that he's not ready, legally at least, for a relationship, and that he may not be for awhile. And it honestly makes me feel dirty because it reminds me that I'm sleeping with another woman's husband. \n\nHow can I get over feeling like the other woman? Or is this something that should not be gotten over and my instinct saying he's not ready is spot on? Has anyone else ever been through this before? Did it...end well?\nTL;DR:"}

I was already going to give here $400 for my books. I don't think that I should give her the $1,200 ( my parents are not good with money and they will just waste it). I would use the money for my next few semesters, gas, and trying to move out. I tried to explain this to them. They tried to say that I owe them at least $2,200 in total and that I'm getting a deal to only pay $1,200. I want to keep the money hidden but it's almost impossible that they will forget about it...

Here's a short backstory:\n\nMet this guy wayyyyy long ago, probably almost 10 years ago. Good friends since, always \"friends with benefits\" kind of thing going on. I would break up with a SO, he'd be there; he'd break up with a SO, I was there. Was very on/off for many years - but NEVER official. \n\nLast year I had a \"last straw\" with him. Didn't talk for over a year because of some personal things going on. Of course, after so long of that we started it up this past few weeks. He currently has a SO, but when I met up with him I had no idea (he doesn't have a facebook and I havent talked to him in almost a year). After hooking up, he mentions he wants to be with me and to do anything to make it right. \n\nThis stuck in my mind because it's something I've NEVER heard come from his mouth. So is he telling the truth? I tell him okay what are we waiting for... and I'm then told of the situation. Instantly freak out and basically say \"figure your shit out\".\n\nIt's been two weeks. There is still no word if he's ended things or not. I'm absolutely torn because not only is him saying those things everything I've ever wanted, but because I know he's not anything I deserve. I don't know what to do in this situation. How do you deal with someone who you've loved since you've met and who you've thought would be yours forever? I am torn between what I've always wanted and what I deserve.\nTL;DR:"}

It's always dismissed when I bring up the issue.\nPOST: Hey all,\n\nLong time lurker here love this sub, people here give great advice. Using a throwaway because friends know my username. To start I love my girlfriend, Sara. A lot. She's really got it all and I could see myself spending the rest of my life with her. We are really open with each other and I am comfortable with telling her how I feel. I'd say we have a pretty near perfect relationship, rarely fight, have lots of fun, the works.\n\nThere is just one problem, throughout our relationship we have slowly had sex less and less. We started off having sex roughly once a week. It was intimate and quite passionate, I think it was great. However, it has slowly gone from once a week, to once every two weeks, to once a month and sometimes longer. I could count on one hand the amount of times we've had sex since May 1st. Recently I've felt like I'm bothering her by trying to initiate and when we do have sex, it's quite boring. She will often say she is too tired, or when I try to start something she'll say \"can we go to sleep now?\".\n\nAll the rejection has kind of taken a toll on me mentally. I've started to feel undesired by her and it's lowering my self confidence quite a bit. I've told her this and it generally leads to what I feel is pity sex that night, then back to the usual sex once in a blue moon. She is very caring and sympathetic and she always tells me she doesn't mean to make me feel this way, and I believe this. I want to be able for the two of us to have sex and both enjoy it. I have no idea what the issue could be and like I said, generally we are very open with each other but I feel there may be something she is not telling me.   \n\nI just don't know how to approach this situation in a way that Sara will take it a little more seriously. I'd like to talk to her tonight as she is coming over. Am I doing something wrong or being unreasonable here?\nTL;DR:"}

I take really long dumps, so 30 minutes is barely enough time for me to get ready for class. I proceed as usual and go to school.

She says it's really rude to masturbate next to her while she's sleeping. I'm immediately taken aback, and wonder how she could possibly think this. She says she saw me and caught me red handed, which of course didn't happen, because I literally wasn't masturbating. \"I knew you would deny it and lie about it\" she says, and I'm like \"I don't have much other recourse if I didn't actually do it, do I?\" I respond, and it goes in circles until she packs her things and leaves. \n\nI have no idea why or how this could even possibly happen. My only guess is she dreamed it, as she does have very vivid dreams, especially of the waking kind.

She just got her license, which I knew from the beginning wouldn't mean a thing. For some reason, she had the idea that, that would give her freedom. She went home yesterday from my house after being afraid to get in the car with her mom because of the simple fact that she was with me. Her mom threatened to take her car away if she didn't comply with her standards. Her \"standards\" are staying home and becoming a hermit. When we first met, she couldn't even come outside to talk to me because her grandparents would tell on her to her mother. The thing is, I don't blame her at all, I can't imagine the pain she goes through from feeling that kind of strain from her family and the feeling of entrapment. She wants to change and says I've helped her a lot, but she also sometimes blames me for trying to help her out of this hole because of the repercussions she receives. Anyone have any advice for how I should handle this?\nTL;DR:"}

As the clothes added some unnecessary bulk to the bag and I was going to be doing a lot of walking, I left most of my clothing in the hotel room.\n\nI came back to the hotel on day 2 (left at about 10am, came back about 6pm or so), went up to my room, found the key didn't work.  Another pair of guests opened the door and was wondering about the ruckus.  Found out the hard way that I have been kicked out (checkout time was 11am), and I asked the front desk and they said it was a booking mixup - they thought I only booked for a night when I wanted to book for 5.  The manager eventually got me into another room so that at least I wasn't homeless for my trip, but nobody seemed to have the damndest clue about what happened to the clothes I left in my old room.  \n\nI pestered the FD/manager every day that I had a chance to and they just kept putting me off, saying that they'll contact the housekeeper - so they did and they said she didn't see anything, which I found incredibly damn hard to believe because it was in one big plastic bag, so I'm not sure what exactly said housekeeper did with the clothes, because they didn't disappear into thin air.  Eventually I just came to the conclusion that they really didn't give a damn and I wasn't going to get my clothes back by the time I checked out on day 5, and the ~$150 worth of clothes, I felt, wasn't worth the extra effort to chase over and it was all replaceable, so I gave up and left NYC feeling very frustrated with my experience with said hotel.\n\nFor future reference, in case something like this happens again, as a tourist, what are my possible options?\nTL;DR:"}

She told me that they said to her basically that they are devastated that their daughter would think to go on a vacation alone with her boyfriend (her mom actually cried over this).\n\nIt's totally insulting because we've both waited for so long to save sex for marriage (we've spent our entire youths celibate and haven't even made out), and they act as if the second we're alone far away from them we'll completely change. It feels like we've demonstrated that we are mature Catholic adults who can control ourselves but they don't seem to recognize this at all.\n\nI'm honestly very confused by this situation because we've both wanted to do this together so badly and we don't want to be treated like children, but I don't want to cause conflict between myself and her parents or between her and her parents.

Now reddit, I was an angst filled 8th grader once too, and though I hated my teachers I certainly never threatened to rape their children.

My sister is a very small girl, and I am very protective of her. My first instinct in this situation was to rain down hell fire on the entire 8th grade class, but alas, my mother stopped me. I have conceded that the kid obviously has no intention of following through with the threats since they are coming from a blocked number and have been going on over a month without any other actions, BUT I want to convey to this kid that it is NOT OKAY to say these things to ANYONE nevermind my sister.

I know that the people who gossip are being assholes, but I do think I have issues when it comes to how I portray myself and looking back, I do think I'm kind of weird.\n\nFirst off, I am a very shy and an introvert. I prefer to be by myself sometimes. At social gatherings, while I am able to talk to some people, it never comes close to a friendship. I only have a few associates who like me. I am sometimes worried about whether I should ask for phone numbers or Instagram names because I feel as though they don't want anything to do with me. I always find myself refusing to go to parties when it has a lot of people I barely or don't know at all. \n\nSecond off, I can be very paranoid when it comes to my classmates. This may be because I went through so much bullying in my high school years and I didn't have enough self-esteem to stick up for myself sometimes. I sometimes think that just because people look at me and laugh, I assume they don't like me and try to bully me. While some of them were assholes towards me, some of them actually turned out to be nice people. \n\nNow I know that I shouldn't be worrying about what people think of me, but I want to at least improve this aspect of myself.

The problem arises when we are out with our friends or other mixed groups when we both have vacations and spend time with other people.

She says that I ignore her and it seems like we are not a couple and every single time we are out with people she feels that way. Now I asked my close friends if they noticed anything and they say that everything looks normal. To clarify the issue, my girlfriend is a listener, she is not a story teller and even when we are out alone I am mostly talking and she is listening and giving me her opinion. I first though that she is not talking in our outings because she is just listening but as I said later I found out that she is annoyed by this and I need to show her much attention and get her into the discussion rather than leaving her listening. Its not that I am ignoring her or anything but I am the type of person that talks all the times in groups outing and I speak to whoever is talking to me. Now what shall I do to counter this issue ? as I said we rarely go out with other people and sometimes I dont know how to act or what to do around in front of them, but its summer time now and we are both having vacations and we will soon start going out with other people and I dont want her to left out or ignored.\nTL;DR:"}

But after I found a suspicious text on her phone, she broke down and said that she had feelings for someone else and that she thought it would just be easier for her to date someone her own age and not feel inferior to my life experience. After all the yelling and the tears we were over. She had become my best friend and because I'm not younger or she isn't older, our solid relationship fell apart for no real reason other then we were expecting it to. In the time we were together she went from this wild child with an eating disorder to now a full on booking network actress with wit and an incredible sharpness. She said that she felt she was always the kid because she had so many questions... This breaks my heart. She's my best friend. I'm lost without her and its literally a set of numbers that has pushed us apart.\nTL;DR:"}

However, he will be graduating soon, in May, and it seems as though he will probably be moving across the country because of a great job offer. We've talked about it in passing and if he accepts the job, it seems as though he wants to stay together until he graduates and break up immediately after, but I'm not really sure because he never says so explicitly, only hinting in ways such as saying that we should appreciate \"what time we have last\". \n\nI am considering asking him if he'd want to stay together via long distance but it doesn't even seem as though as it has crossed his mind whereas I could see myself in this for the long haul. We've been apart for a few months at a time before over the summer, but never more than 3 months at a time. I'm afraid to bring it up because I feel like he doesn't really take our relationship seriously. I need help with how I should bring it up in a way that doesn't pressure him too much, but I really just need to know how he truly feels about it.\n\nIn addition, if I bring it up and it turns out he is completely opposed to the idea, is it worth continuing the relationship for the rest of the year? I feel like it's selfish of him to expect this. I love being with him, but I feel like I would be unhappy in a relationship I felt was going nowhere.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Random Act of Kindness - Mistake or Good Choice?\nPOST: So, earlier today I was involved in a car accident.  I had the right of way, and the other driver was supposed to stop at a stop sign.  Unfortunately the other driver did not stop and I was hit.  Nobody was injured (it was a fairly minor collision), but my wheel well was noticeably fucked up and I could barely drive it.  The other driver's friend called the police immediately - while we waited an off duty cop stopped by and basically said that, although we didn't have to, if we filed a report - one of the drivers would get a citation.  He then told the other driver that it was very likely she would get the citation - as I had the right of way.  We then exchanged information (we are both insured) and the other driver, who was very nice, said she would prefer not filing a report (though she said she would file one if I wanted).  She also noted that she would admit responsibility.  I told her that because her friend had already called the police - that we should wait and see what they thought.  When the police officer arrived - he re-iterated   what the other officer said, and he gave us the option to figure it out on our own.  Against my best judgment - I decided that we should figure it out on our own (preventing the other driver from receiving an additional citation(fine)).  I asked her to contact her insurance company and file a claim, and I received a voicemail from her a bit later.  In the VM she noted that she has filed a claim and she apologized for the inconvenience.  I then left a message with her insurance company - explaining the situation from my point of view (what happened) and asking them to contact me.  Did i make a mistake in not filing the police report - even though I saved the other driver from receiving a citation?\nTL;DR:"}

This isn't a particularly interesting story or anything, no cheating, no fight. I had a huge crush on a girl for over a year (my junior year of high school, her senior year)and she didn't feel the same way. We were, however, very good friends, and she took me to prom. After prom, we started dating, and this led to the best summer of both our lives. We never fought, we laughed the hardest we ever had, and we were quickly intimate and confessing our love for each other. She had told me she didn't want to date into college (she is a freshman currently). However, towards the end of the summer, she was ready to try dating thought college, long distance (I'm in Connecticut, she's in Massachusetts). We talked about me visiting her, FaceTiming, normal stuff. This was my first girlfriend and, so, first break up, and...it's really hard. I mean, of course it is, but it's worse than I ever could have imagined. It's like my entire world is flipped upside down. I'm never hungry anymore, hanging out with people is different, I keep expecting texts from her. It's really difficult. \nShe did say that she wants to take a break so she can settle in to school and that it doesn't necessarily mean that it's over forever, whatever that means. I'm not getting my hopes up and I don't think I should. \nI'm just looking for some advice. After such an actually perfect relationship, is this the right thing to do? And, she wants this, should we stay friends? I don't know. I'm just lost right now. Difficult time to be feeling all this, y'know?\nTL;DR:"}

I have had one true love in my life that I feel so strongly for. I knew her since middle school. As time went, we hung out, became close friends. She lit up my life - a smile and a \"hi\" were all I needed from her to turn the worst day into a great day. We drifted in High School, then came back in late HS and stayed connected in College. I expressed my feelings, she didnt feel the same. We drifted apart - eventually I cut her out of my life. It was pretty cold turkey - went from hanging out to ignoring her as i couldnt stand seeing her with other guys (dating). At the time, I felt it was the best thing for me but now looking back I do feel bad. \n\nNow, I still think about her. Nobody has ever made me feel the way I did when with her. I have reached the point that I want to try again at her and contact her.  I do not believe she is married. It would take some digging for me to find her but believe i could (IE facebook). \n\nMy question is, for the ladies, if you had a close friend that cut you out of their life, then tried to re-connect with you 10 years later, would you? Would you believe people change and maybe date them? Would you forgive them? Would you understand what they were going through and understand it? I feel like this girl is the only girl that can bring me happiness and I really want to reconnect with her.\nTL;DR:"}

He said he is trying, which I am thankful for. \n\n3. He wants to cuddle + more, a lot.

Jake and I have discussed going on some sort of double date with them but we don't even know which girl would be with which guy since we both now have slight crushes on both girls. Overall very strange situation, any insight would be much appreciated! Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

Either too prematurely over something stupid, or I stayed with the wrong person for too long.\n\nSo what's happening now is I've been dating my boyfriend for 6 months, and I am his first girlfriend. At the beginning, he was very sweet, we really enjoyed being around each other, and (not that I require this) he would pay for me all the time.\n\nIn the past couple of months, he has stopped trying. He said he can't pay for me except for special occasions because he can't afford it anymore, he has stopped telling me sweet things (he says that \"after 4 months, I figure that those things are obvious\"), and I've realized that he is really unaware of basic social rules.\n\nIt started when I was done exams and he said he'd take me out for dinner. Because I was studying for exams, we hadn't seen each other for about 2 weeks. First of all, he brought his best friend with him, and he was wearing basketball shorts. To dinner. And when I asked him about it, he said that he does not understand why it is unacceptable. Another incident was when his roommate's girlfriend let us stay in her house for a weekend, and when she asked us how we slept, he said \"Bad, it was really uncomfortable.\" So I find myself having to explain to him basic things such as being polite and thankful to a host. The problem is that he generally doesn't agree with me and he is extremely stubborn.\n\nI was living with him temporarily because he goes to school out of town, and some days he would come home and not even say hi to me. I told him it made me upset, and he said \"Okay I didn't know. I'll say hi to you when I get home.\" But even though he agreed with this, I find it grueling to explain to him such basic things.\nTL;DR:"}

I agree to give her time and space to think. One leek later she tells me she misses me but she still doesn't know what she wants, because she is very undecisive and she wanted to make it work and that's way she asked for time to think. 2/3 days after I broke up with her cause I've had enough, so it lasted almost 2 months. \n\n2 weeks later classes start again and I miss her, I tell her, I also tell her that I was wrong to put so much pressure on her to make a decision.

The landlord requires 60 days advance notice of ending the lease or moving out and I only gave the landlord 45 days. They say I need to pay rent until November 10th. In the lease agreement, there is an evergreen clause that says the lease will automatically renew until they are given 60 days' notice of intent to terminate the lease. \n\nThe lease was drafted in 2012 and in 2013 Georgia passed a law limiting evergreen clauses specifically in GA Code 13-12-2 (2014), which to summarize basically states that an automatic renewal provision needs to disclose it clearly and conspicuously on the rental agreement. \n\nOn my lease the  renewal clause is written in the same font and text as everything else. In Lewis V. Citizens & S. Bank (1983), The Georgia Court of Appeals held that contract terms were disclosed \"clearly\" and \"conspicuously\" if they were in boldfaced font and in all capital letters. The provision in question is neither of those things, and when it was drafted, they couldn't have been following the law since the it was released a year later. \n\nMy question is if this clause is void in light of GA code 13-12-2 and what are my options if they try to enforce it?\nTL;DR:"}

She does get depressed sometimes out of the blue for no reason, and this is when she is most likely to self harm (cut, throw up, etc..).\n\nI don't know if I should even try to help, I cut all communication since our breakup and plan to stick to that for at least 1st semester..

For the first 8 months, everything was fantastic. We really enjoy doing the same things, and are very happy to be around each other, even if it's doing nothing. And the sex is great, and we have similar kinks. But about 6 weeks ago, the sex just sort of stopped.

Each time I bring it up, the conversation ends with her apologizing for \"being broken\", and mentioning how this is always a problem in her relationships. So now I just don't know what to do.

We're crazy about each other and we're great friends as well.\n\nIn the last year or so, I have also been questioning my sexuality. As of right now, I am pretty sure I am bisexual, somewhere around a 1.5 or a 2 on the Kinsey Scale. SO knows this and has even offered to allow me to experiment with girls (with some yet-to-be-discussed boundaries). In recent months, my quest for queerness has continued to confuse me, to the point that I think that the only way to fix it is to take him up on his offer.\n\nThe Problem: I accept and understand that everyone, including myself, has a past, be it sex, relationships, or both. I have no issues with this. However, he has previously made comments in passing about the fact that he has never dated a totally straight girl and that he and a previous gf used to be pretty spontaneous and kinky, even getting other people involved in sex. The former comment was made only a couples weeks ago, but now every time I try to sort out my own sexuality and feelings about it, I think about his past and get completely turned off by my own possible bisexuality. I feel really inferior to and threatened by his ex's, even though I know for a fact that he's over them and quite happy where he is (as am I).\n\nThese thoughts in turn are making me feel shitty about his willingness to let me explore. I think he's awesome for being so open about it, but then again I hate the idea of being \"supervised\" or feeling like I'm not free and in control. There is also lingering worry that he may want to watch me with girls or get involved, which I don't know if I'd normally be game for because I'm too busy feeling insecure and turned off by all of this.\nTL;DR:"}

Well, midway through, father's co-worker notices a phone in front of the lady, and makes the anouncement of the century: \"Hey, her phone looks just, like, mine... uh-oh\" Yes ladies and gentlement, it was his phone. \n\nAfter getting her and her child (bouncing baby boy) to the hospital, the co-worker, while under ridicule of the other medics and some hospital staff, puts his phone in a bio-hazard bag, gives it to a nurse on duty and says \"I'm going to need that disinfected, if you don't mind.\" He still uses the phone today, under much ridicule from his co-workers, and myself.\n\nSo reddit, what's your favorite story from any jobsite, whether it be your job, your friends, or your families job.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My boyfriend's parents (mid-50's) dislike me (22) because of my financial status. How can I win them over?\nPOST: I come from a lower-middle/working class family and in order to go to college had to take out student loans, leaving me in quite a bit of debt. I have a good job now that pays a decent amount and has a lot of room for growth, but right now it's not enough to pay my loans.\n\nMy boyfriend (also 22) comes from an upper-middle class family. His parents paid for his college and he also has a trust fund and sizable inheritance. He also works in an industry that pays four times what mine does.\n\nAt the moment my boyfriend is helping me pay off my student loans with the agreement that I will pay him back once I'm making more money. Or, if we were to get married (definite possibility), we would combine our incomes and it wouldn't matter.\n\nHis parents do not like the fact that I have so much debt. They think I am financially unstable and will suck my boyfriend dry. I won't lie, the fact that he is able to help me financially is a big plus, but I love him regardless of money and if we were to marry we would work together regarding finances. With our incomes combined we would be able to pay off my loans and live a decent, middle-class lifestyle. \n\nHowever, I'm still not what his parents wanted for him. They want him to marry a girl who comes from a wealthier family and even though they like me as a person they can't get over the fact that I'm not what they wanted. Because of this my relationship with his parents is rocky and my boyfriend always gets an earful about my debt. Is there any good way to fix this?\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know what kind of game she's playin' but here it goes.\n\nSo, since last year this girl (she's pretty attractive, but it's not my crush) has been doing some 'things' to me, maybe it's just a coincidence, maybe not. I mention that we're not friends, just classmates.\n\nLast year in a subject while I was asking the teacher something she also came and as I was talking to the teacher she began leaning towards me and getting closer, to the point of laying her head on my shoulder. I kind of felt excited and confused at the same time.\n\nToday, a similar experience happened. At maths I was just goin' to ask the teacher somethin' and she was just behind me, well, she was getting little by little 'too closer', if you know what I mean. It was so awkward because for a moment I thought that I touched her breasts with my elbow, I was so embarrassed and confused, I also blushed a little.\nI find that behaviour pretty cute though...\n\nMy question is, why does she do these things to me if she doesn't like me? She seems like she doesn't since she almost never talks to me... and she is very outgoing. She's not shy around me at all. She doesn't blush. She talks to me like normal [rarely, when she does].\n\nThanks.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm a virgin, and I haven't been in a relationship since freshman year. I feel very lonely, and when the school announced where the Senior Prom (at the end of the year) is going to be (a very cool place) reminded me how alone I am, and how I need to have a girlfriend by the end of the year.\n\nOnly trouble is, I don't have a lot of opportunity to be around girls outside of my classes. A lot of my hobbies and extracurriculars are either incredibly male-heavy, or involve working with children or senior citizens. I also feel that I bleed insecurity and desperation. Despite this, I drive, I get good grades (4.5 last semester), and I have a job, but I still feel inadequate and unworthy, as I'm not good enough to have a girlfriend. There's something wrong with me, and I'm not sure what it is, but it makes girls not want to be around me. I'm not smooth, or very popular. I've read pick-up artist stuff and realized very shortly that it's mysogynist crap. Unfortunately, that leaves me with not knowing much, as the internet seems to be polluted with more PUA garbage than actual advice.\n\nAs for myself, I'm not very picky. I am attracted to all races and sizes. But I just feel like a huge loser because I don't have a girlfriend and fear that I never will, even in college. My greatest fear is becoming the stereotypical neckbeard/basement dweller, and being a virgin for life, with no love either.\n\nI really need to find a girlfriend who I can share some of my life with. I'm alone on a Friday night surfing Reddit, like many other lonely nights before. I don't know where to start. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Am I being discriminated against? (x-post from r/diabetes)\nPOST: The background: In January of 2015, I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I was close to DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis, a.k.a. diabetic coma) when I entered the ER (blood glucose was 600, A1c was 14)*, and thus had to take some significant time off of work. Since then, I've had to continue to take off more time for related illness and doctor's appointments.\n\nThe job: I currently work at a small non-profit organization in the United States (Illinois). There are only 6 employees, including my boss (CEO/Executive Director). In a given calendar year (January 1 - December 31), we are allotted 15 \"personal days\". These days are not differentiated (i.e. there is no difference between sick days, vacation days, bereavement days, etc.), and there is currently no company-wide policy on what happens if someone uses all of their \"personal days\". Furthermore, we have no short term disability policy.\n\nAs of writing this, I have taken off 14 of my 15 \"personal days\".\n\nThe situation: A short time ago, my boss approached me with a document that alters my working schedule based on the amount of time I have taken off thus far. It gives me 5 additional (unpaid) days off, but prevents me from receiving a raise or promotion until January 2016 (when my \"personal days\" would renew). Additionally, if I use the 5 unpaid days off before the end of the year (December 31), I will be forced to move to part-time (4 days a week, 30 hours a week, with a 20% pay cut), but will still retain my health insurance.\n\nI have been told verbally (I have a recording of this conversation) that this agreement only applies to me. However, my boss has refused to clarify exactly why, in writing or verbally, this only applies to me (also have on recording). See the document in the link below.\n\nThe question: Is this discrimination? I don't really understand the legal stuff around this and would love some insight. Any and all advice is welcome.\nTL;DR:"}

It started when I got a new job that is my dream job, and occupies all my time. She helped me with it and our dynamic changed very quick. \n\nWell after that experience, our relationship is a lot more tense. It is a gradual downhill battle, things are getting vicious. I have gotten into a bad depression due to all the stress I was under. She has a history of depression to, so you would think she would be on my side over it, but she has slowly begun despising me.  She won't let me touch her for one, any time we do it becomes a bit thing. She got an IUD which really hurts, scrapes against it. She refuses to believe it is a problem and says it's in my head. So we have not been intimate. \n\nToday she wanted to take a nap and I wanted to relax in bed with the computer, and she said I'm not allowed to, I have to leave. But I wouldn't, then she starts beating on me, hitting me, kicking me, scratching me, screaming. I never seen anything like it. \n\nI think that I should leave her. Our eight year relationship was so fun and respectful and it just turned ugly so fast. But there are a few things I am worried about. One is we have a cat and dog. I am worried I would never get to see them again. \n\nShould I take the dog? \n\nTwo is, I still love her... but I can't do this anymore. I can't be with her and fight 24/7. It will just get uglier and uglier at this stage. \n\nWe have been together so long, we are a family. I am really afraid to leave her and break up our little family. \n\nGetting all my things in the apartment. Seeing her date other men. It is frightening to me. She was the only relationship I ever had. \n\nI think I need the courage to do what I have to. Right now my body is so sore from all the hitting she did.\nTL;DR:"}

There was no argument and I thought we were on good terms, so I had no idea what the problem was.\n\nRecently, he texted apologizing for not responding and asked if we could meet up and talk, which I agreed to. He basically told me that his girlfriend was jealous of me and that he was concerned that I liked him too much and that put a strain on their relationship. So he thought the easiest way to fix this was to cut me out of his life. After a months, he felt bad and contacted me. I like my friend a lot, but as only a friend, not at all romantically. He kind of laughed it off and said once he ran this by his now fiance, everything should be good and we can be friends again.\n\nThe problem is that I don't really want to. I feel betrayed and disrespected by him. I like to have a few very close friends and he had been one of them. I just feel like I mean nothing to him and just want to move on with my life. Am I being overly dramatic? Should I forgive him? I told him I'd think about it and he said that it was fine. I don't know what to do.

But I'm also afraid that he is doing it for the wrong reasons and will be devastated if things don't work out. He's also been depressed for most of our time apart (due to a host of factors including unemployment, family trouble, and probably our long-distance relationship itself... it's certainly led to a lot of loneliness for me). I'm afraid he's moving to be with me now just because he needs a change, not because he thinks we're still a good fit. I do want things to get better for him, but I don't know if this is the best way for him to move forward. Over the past few years our values have shifted, anc I don't know if we'll make a good team like we did when we were younger. \n\nAlso, after all this time apart I view him more as a close friend than a lover. Maybe that will change if he moves here, but the hurt he would experience (and that I would experience too) if things don't work out seems like a really big risk to take if I'm not 99% optimistic about this.

It isn't anything remotely like the amount of physical time spent being around each other (we were housemates who started dating, so we've been living together the entirety of the time we've dated). We have basically discussed it and if we were to get back together, it would be for long term.\n\nAm I a shit person? It's not really the prospect of being single that is driving me, I have just found myself increasingly thinking about her less and less when we aren't communicating directly, and beginning to enjoy the 'singleness' that I am currently in.\n\nI really, really loved her up until she left (which was a really hard time for both of us), but now I feel the distance rapidly getting to me. I told her while we were skyping today that I was feeling the distance getting to me and felt that my feelings were waning and she was visibly upset about it. She then messaged me later on saying we should take the week off from contact (ie calling, till we Skype next weekend) to get a bit of distance.\nTL;DR:"}

I know she will take it if she gets it, and I also know for certain we couldn't survive indefinite long distance. We both know that if she takes the job, she's throwing away the future we have planned (we have most definitely planned to get married in the next few years).\nThe job itself is a little bit of a longshot, maybe she won't get it, and then I \"don't have to worry about it.\" But I fear the damage has already been done. How could she do this, she knows we will break up if she takes this job, so by applying, she is essentially already trying to break up; if it doesn't work out, she will fall back on me.\nTL;DR:"}

We live relatively near each other, but my parents are unsupportive of the relationship (for various reasons)\u2026 So the time we can spend together is extremely limited. In fact, the majority of the time we \"spend together\" is online, like most LDR couples.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I'm extremely supportive of my boyfriend spending time with his friends. I've learned over the years that time apart is necessary for a happy, healthy relationship. When he tells me he's going out and getting offline, I'm all smiles, and I send him off with a big \"Hope you have fun tonight!\" I'm all for independence, I really am. I'm not one of those girlfriends who expects their boyfriend to drop everything they're doing to come talk to me.\n\nBut the thing is, he goes out every single night\u2026without fail. He's gone from around dinner time to 3-4AM. He sleeps all day, wakes up at around 4-5PM, we talk or hang out (if possible) for around an hour, and then he leaves again to go out with friends.\n\nEvery time I try talking about it, he gets extremely riled up. So I just ended up giving up on discussing the issue. But yeah, the other day, when I had a horrible, horrible day and wanted to talk to him for a while, I just acted a little sad that he was leaving, and even then he started getting angry.\n\nI presume that this is an issue that at least some LDR couples go through. Is this something that I simply have to get over? Am I acting selfish / spoiled for wanting him to stay in once in a while?\nTL;DR:"}

Today she said she needed time to think and we should take a break.

Currently, she feels trapped and is not sure if she can get out of her contract and still be able to teach somewhere else as soon as she can.\n\nLong story short, this charter school fails to meet Arizona standards across all contents and is, in turn, a failed attempt at creating a better learning environment for its students.

The school has failed to give her the tools she needs to help her students succeed, but has demanded that she take additional professional development courses and professional exams at our expense.

We saw a few ants, but assumed they would go away with regular treatment and moved in. Long story short - we spent 2 1/2 years fighting a never ending infestation of these insects that are impossible to get rid of. We would spray and the dead ants would pile up so high over a couple of nights that we would have to vacuum them up because the live ants were crawling over them to get into the house avoiding the poison.\n\nFast forward to this past April: My wife and I put money down on new construction and signed a no refund contract. We checked the property and other older houses in the neighborhood and saw no sign of these ants. We visit our lot everyday because we are excited to buy our first house. In June we start seeing SOME ants when they bring in sand to level the foundation, but don't want to believe they are what we think they are. They start getting worse, we take a sample in to a local exterminator confirming they are [Rasberry Crazy Ants] and eventually let the builder know that we are backing out. \n\nThey are willing to give our earnest money back, but refuse to refund our upgrade deposit stating that it's a local problem and they have no control. We know that once they invade, they are impossible to get rid of, cost thousands in monthly treatments to try to control, and don't want to deal with this in a brand new house.\nDo I have any options?\nTL;DR:"}

We are both students, but my part time job pays more than hers. Still, she paid almost nothing even though she makes 60% of what I do. This would not be a problem (I can understand that she might have more student loans, more difficult family situation, etc), except for the fact that she spends irresponsibly on her personal items, such as buying expensive make-up, shoes, clothes, etc. \n\nThis \"fight\" led to us not talking for a while. In that time, I learned that she had gone to a male friend of hers, whom I do not know, who is a professional photographer. She posed nude for him for a series of photos, and sent them to me a few days later. While I begrudgingly admit the artistic merit of some of them, they were overtly sexual and provocative, and definitely involved full nudity. Even featured some sex toys I recognized (no penetration of any kind, however). She also hinted that she thinks the photographer is interested in her, but maintained that she did not \"do anything.\" \n\nI'm at a loss. I can't even figure out what is going on in this girl's head. I don't know if I should be mad or how much. The original argument seems to pale in response to this. How do I respond?\nTL;DR:"}

Essentially a car was indicating left at a roundabout (only options were straight and left) but carried on straight over. I had moved out, assuming they were turning left. My fault. I accept that.\n\nNow the insurance company said that they would do all their checks (including indemnity) before authorising repairs. Eventually (about 2 weeks later) they authorised the repairs and the car was taken away. That was about 3-4 weeks ago. The day before yesterday, the car was finally returned, yay! Then yesterday, I received a letter from the indemnity department saying that there was an incident that had not been originally declared. This is where I need help and I apologise for the long post.\n\nThe incident relates to my dad (the main driver and registered keeper) from back in December 2009. Someone (we'll call him A) had stopped in front of my dad and shouted at him for apparently blocking A at a junction. He threatened to claim that my dad touched his car. My dad got home and rang his insurance company asking for advice. They told him it was probably just road rage and not to worry about it, though they'll make a note of it just in case.\n\nThis was the incident our insurer is now referring to. It wasn't declared because they had asked for details of any 'accidents, losses or thefts'. We didn't think general road rage fell under any of these catagories, but now the insurer says they will not pay out and are asking for all sorts of random details (i.e. why did we decide to purchase our car back in 2008).\n\nMy questions to you good people are such:\na).

I laughed saying that handies and crocheting were two different movements and made the wank hand gesture and then the crocheting movement. The cashier saw me make the wank gesture but averted her eyes before the crochet one so must've assumed I was calling her a Wanker. What's worse is that there was also a disabled helper raising money for charity packing bags at the till and my husband thought I was making the gesture at them and asked me if I felt horrible on our way out of the shop.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How do you cope with moving away, out-of-state, and leaving your friends behind? [16M]\nPOST: So I found out earlier this year I was moving about 1000 miles away from my current state. At first I didn't really worry about it or care that much and I was actually pretty darn excited because I absolutely hated my town. Being a pretty quiet guy I was only really leaving a few close friends so at the time, it wasn't a big deal.\n\nBut then a few days ago there was a banquet for one of the teams I was a part of. And it was that night that it struck me that I was actually moving and that I would never see my friends after this year ever again. Then the next day, the coach talked to me (she talks one-on-one with everyone at the end of the year) and she just talked about how popular I was to the team, how everyone seemed to care about me and I cared about them, how if there was a favorite person award, I would have probably gotten it (at the banquet), blah blah blah. And things got progressively worse as many of my teammates began to say how much they'd miss me and such. \n\nI was just so surprised because I was under the impression that I was leaving very little behind and not many people would truly miss me when in reality it was the exact opposite. And its so strange because I've only known these people for 1 to 2 years. So now with the series of events, as crazy as this sounds, I am now unsure of my emotions and feel like I will cry buckets on the day I leave.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: How should I (28F) break the news to this guy (41M) that I'd been seeing casually over the past four years that I'm now seeing someone else (34M)?\nPOST: BACKGROUND: In a nutshell, the 41M I had been seeing on-and-off casually, non-exclusively for close to 4 years. We haven't seen each other in person since last September, just before he moved out of country for a job. We would continue to occasionally chat on Gchat, and I also consider him a friend. Since last September, however, I've started seeing another guy (34M), things got serious, and we moved in together about two months ago. (Yes, I know that might seem a little fast, but I've known this guy for close to 7 years, and it felt right blah blah blah).\n\nNow, the 41M is back in town asked me out again. I hadn't kept him abreast of the goings on in my life, because I dunno, it just felt weird to casually drop on Gchat \"hey I'm dating another guy now\" because we've never really talked about who else we're seeing.\n\nAlso, I didn't really expect he would move back in town and would hit me up, and to top it off, he seems pretty eager to see me again. Part of me doesn't want to waste his time and just tell him off the bat online or via text that I'm not only seeing someone else, but we're living together, which is admittedly pretty big news. Also, I'm old school and even though what we had was casual, we've still been through a lot together and I'm not really comfortable breaking things off online or even via phone. However, I feel like if I say yes, let's meet up for drinks and then break the news to him then, I'm kind of wasting his time/ getting his hopes up for nothing. He also has a tendency to be slightly unpredictable and can have a bit of a temper, so I'm nervous about that going badly. But I genuinely want to remain on good terms with him, I care about him and want to maintain a friendship.\nTL;DR:"}

Almost overwhelmingly so, for me. Money isn't really an issue, but I'd rather spend less if possible and cut the guest list where we can. We're not getting married until fall 2016, so we have lots of time to plan.\n\nSo far, we've been in agreement or willing to compromise about the wedding in general and the guest list, but there's one person who he wants to invite who I really just don't. This girl is his younger sister's good (best?) friend, and she's stayed at his house a few times visiting. She went to the same college as us, but I barely know her. My main experiences with her are when his sister and her would sometimes stop by my fianc\u00e9's fraternity on weekends, go to his room to drink a few shots of his alcohol, and then leave. Which I thought was kind of tacky to be basically using him for his booze, although my fianc\u00e9 didn't mind, so I didn't say anything.\n\nI don't really understand why he wants to invite her. As far as I can tell, she's friends with his sister, not him. Aside from minor annoyance at the booze-using, I really do like his sister and am glad to have her in the wedding party, but I don't feel obligated to invite her bff to the wedding. We'll definitely be inviting the sister's boyfriend, so it's not like she'll be lonely. \n\nAlso, her friend has made comments/jokes (I wasn't there, this is secondhand) about being our flower girl, which I find kind of weird. I don't hate this chick or have a problem with her, but I would feel annoyed with having her at our already overly-large wedding. I tried discussing this with my fianc\u00e9 to understand why he wants to invite her and better convey why I don't, but he just said to drop it for now. \n\nAm I being unreasonable? Should I just consent to inviting this girl, or insist on not having her?\nTL;DR:"}

I have doubts about that as well, but it is not my main concern at the moment. \n\nSo, to jump right in, I hold a lot of resentment towards my siblings. Why? They constantly make me feel worthless and/or leave me out of every conversation. I feel as though I'm growing distant from them and I don't know what to do. I've already told them that I don't appreciate the conversations constantly being one-sided (about something medically related), but they neglect to take my feelings into consideration. No one likes being left out, and being left out from your family feels horrible considering I have few (if any) friends. \n\nI feel as though I'm going to go nuts living with my family, I would like to move out but my measly Psychology degree won't get me any jobs so I have to wait to either get into medical school or do something else.\n\nFor those of you who are not South-Asian and wondering why my siblings (who are all 26+) are living at home, in our absurd culture, you are not allowed to detach from home until you're married, which none of my elder siblings are.\nTL;DR:"}

It's early, but I am extremely confident in doing so now that I am accountable to more than just myself and can see tangible consequences of my actions first-hand.    \n\nNeedless to say, I have immeasurably hurt my SO over the past few years. Lying, deceit, selfishness, denial and ultimately hindering us from reaching our goals.    \n\nWhile I work on getting better, she is doing likewise and has asked for a clear separation.

While she's partially right given the burden I've been too ashamed to admit until now, there were (are?) so many positive things between us. I hope in time she can realise this, but it's a very daunting and powerless situation to be in right now.    \n\nI acknowledge it's of my own doing. I am not here for sympathy.

She told me that other people with partners had done some pretty sketchy things with other people as dares. The stuff my gf did wasn't as weird though.

After talking to a mutual friend for a few days, I took her back mainly because I love(d) her, I'm co-dependent, and I have no other options.\n\nCue to last week. It doesn't take us a week back together before she blows up (bad temper problems) and we have our worst fight yet. As much as I hated to, I ended it.

Part of this is the realization that I don't want a committed relationship and missed out on dating and exploring who I am, even as far as gender identity and sexual orientation. I want out immediately, but still love and care for my wife and don't want to screw her over. She works, but I definitely earn far more. She could live on her on with her income, but it would be a for sure lifestyle change for her. I've told her all this (and I really mean ALL of it), and she is luckily somewhat understanding albeit severely disappointed and still somewhat in denial. We have marriage counseling and I'm signed up to go to a counselor, but I want out and not to mislead anyone. Also, suffice it to say that my family and many of my old friends will for sure disown/hate/physically threaten me when this all comes out. Not sure where to go or what to do besides continuing to talk with the wife and make plans along with going to counselors. \n\nElaborating, on the brainwashing comment: suffice it to say I was homeschooled and literally taught that all other world-views are evil and dangerous. Between that and going to a church that ultimately disbanded because of persecution and bullying I really do feel that I was in some part brainwashed and lived with an intense guilt that didn't let me make my own choices without actually thinking that I was in danger of hellfire. The internet, and working with a bunch of atheist has ultimately given me the intellectual capacity to see it all as shit. And now I get to go to a counselor and explore how far i've been fucked up. \n\nAs for threat of physical violence; it's actually quite common in my former circle. Christian people are great, and I'm actually basing these remarks on prior incidents involving my in-laws. It sucks to be in this position.\nTL;DR:"}

Once I didn't do anything to see what Shadow would do and she ended up placing her mouth on Sleepy's head, I thought she was biting her it was pretty intense. Sleepy even tries to surrender, she lays on her side but Shadow doesn't care or something. Right now I've resorted to feeding them separate, putting Shadow in a closed off area of the yard. I'm worried its just making her jealous and worsening the problem though. In addition to this Sleepy doesn't let Shadow get near me.

The person who wanted to trade cars told me to meet up with him around 2:30ish because that was the only time he could see me. I would usually go with my stepdad but he had to work until 5ish. So I decided to call an old friend who knows a lot about cars and see if he could help me. My girlfriend doesn't like my old friend because he's a douche who smokes, drinks, and cheats on girls. So my girlfriend thinks he's a bad influence. And she doesn't trust me around him. Better yet, she doesn't trust me at all because she's the type of girl that thinks that \"all guys are the same\" i have never cheated on her, i have never gotten drunk behind her back. She never believes me. Anyways, I had to go with him because I had no choice. And now she's throwing a bitch fit about the whole thing and she says we need a break because I've been annoying her lately. \nI don't really know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

What do I do?\nPOST: It was movie night, I suggested my girlfriend (soon-to-be fiance) and I watch Perks of being a Wallflower which is a good High Schoold drama.  Little did I know that she had been abused before which is a large part of the films subject matter.  She seemed down after the movie, I asked her why and she said when she was sixteen she had been sexually abused by her step dad.  She wouldn't go to into details, but he evidently touched her innapropriately and made creepy comments to her.  She said that it happened \"only a few times\" but I wonder if it could be more and she was just trying to stop me from getting upset. Truth be told, if we didn't live several states away I would have immediately driven over to their house and beat the shit out of the bastard (I'm not a tough guy or anything but I think I could take him).  But I don't know what to do right now.  We are doing some prelimnary wedding discussions, I certainly don't feel comfortable in him being involved at all.  And I don't ever want him to interact with our future children.  And I like my girlfriends mom for the most part, and I wonder if this is something she needs to know.  Wouldn't she want to know that her husband had done this?  Well after telling me my girlfriend said she has never told anyone else and doesn't want me to do anything about.  She has buried it deep down and tried to forget about it and doesn't want anyone to be hurt by it.  Any thoughts on what I should do?  Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

I just want to know enough to make an informed decision about what I should do. She says she would never do it again, but because I don't feel like she understands her decisions or herself, I can't trust those words. I don't feel like she's reciprocating. I understand this is part of the obsession / suppression cycle that betrayed / involved partners experience in this situation. However, I can't get a straight story *at all*. It was a one time fling, 100% physical as she claims, there was a lot of alcohol involved. I understand that sexual variety might be at the heart of this. She seems to be really clingy, really regretful (*now* at least -- a little too late).\n\nWhat could've happened here? She never made an effort to communicate whether there were any deficiencies in the relationship up to the months preceding the event. I know she was under a *lot* of stress, and I tried my hardest to be there for her and help her through it. Fuck, I was even tutoring her in classes I'd never taken before by reading her textbooks. I feel very used and deceived.\n\nI feel like she's young and doesn't understand her signals well. If there was something she really needed, she didn't know how to ask for it. Is this something that therapy solves? On the other hand, she might have been throwing a wrench in the spokes of this relationship, trying to end subconsciously. This idea would disagree with her trying to get back together. I can't stand that kind of waffling, but I guess ambivalence is to be expected.\n\nI'm considering couples counseling because she's young and doesn't understand herself very much. I don't know who she is anymore. It's as if she died, or worse. I still love her very much, but I can't heal until I understand it all regardless of whether we'll try to make the relationship work. However, I would be completely destroyed if it happened again.\n\n**I would very much appreciate input from females**.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: [NSV] By losing weight and strengthening my legs, 5 years of chronic knee pain are gone.\nPOST: In 2010 I started experiencing sharp, chronic knee pain that was diagnosed as chondromalacia patella, where my kneecap was off center. \n\nThis knee pain continued to get worse and bother me for the next 4 years. I stopped running and had to modify my life. I started using knee braces and accepted the reality that there were certain things I would never be able to do again, like long distance running, squats, etc.\n\nIn the past year and a half, I've lost over 50 pounds. However, I only lifted weights with my upper body for fear of destroying my knee with squats, etc. I was completely convinced of this until I saw a specialist (MD PhD, the guy's entire life work was on the knee), who told me I actually should be able to incorporate these exercises into my routine, with caution.\n\nSo for the past few months, I slowly worked my way into squats, deadlifts, etc. I also cycle, mountain bike, hike, do /r/bodyweightfitness, and play plenty of ultimate frisbee. I proceeded with caution, making sure not to aggravate my knee. But as the weeks went by, I slowly noticed it getting better. \n\nThe other day I was at the park doing box jumps and realized that **I no longer feel any indication of knee pain!** The knee pain that had characterized my life for the past half decade is effectively gone, completely. I attribute this to first, losing the weight, but more importantly to strengthening my leg muscles. The feeling of being free from this chronic condition is just as liberating as the other aspects of weightloss that I've experienced. At one point I had considered surgical options, but I've basically beaten this thing with pure old fashioned exercise.\n\nJust goes to show that there are benefits of weightloss and getting fit that may come unexpected.\nTL;DR:"}

By no means did we have a perfect relationship, we had our struggles, the beauty, good and bad.\n\nFor my self this was a very strong and important relationship, I did not plan or want to fall in love with him, from the moment I met him I knew it was something important and special. I told and showed that I loved him, which is not something I have done for anyone in two years. \n\nOne day two weeks ago he calls me and says I want to break up I feel there is no longer chemistry. \n\nWe have had busy schedules, I attend college and two jobs, he has a high stress job. Our relationship was taking time to grow and learn what works best for us, but we had amazing communication. \n\nI tried to express that its been a rough patch give it some time and see if you feel differently, I had a very special surprise date set later that week, that I felt was really going to help him in many ways, lesson the worries and show the good.\n\nHe didn't listen, we ended the conversation, I tried to get him to talk to me, gave him space. He did not return my calls or texts for two weeks. \n\nUntil yesterday, when his only word were \"We can still be friends if you want to.\" \n\nI have not yet responded nor do I have any more ideas about what he is feeling or wants.\n\nKnowing that his idea of a relationship has to be perfect all the time, Should I take a friendships with the only goal is to get back together, help him see and in hope to bring back the \"chemistry\" or is it just a set up for failure?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Not sure what I(17M) should do regarding the friendship I have with this girl (17F)\nPOST: So, to start this all off, this girl and I have been friends for four years, since 8th grade, where we \"dated\" and then just became really really good friends. Every relationship she had, I'd help her out with and vice versa. Since the start of 2013, we have both gradually shown more interest in the other. We both think the other one is really attractive, and both know that the other thinks that. Also, we both know that if we get alone, we'll end up making out. Each time we have hung out with friends and watch a movie, because we don't have cars, we end up cuddling and getting relatively touchy-feely. Now, I have 2 main problems.\n\nProblem One is that she doesn't want a legitimate relationship, or to start a \"thing\" with anyone, even though we already sorta have something going on. We've established that we're just friends, but she has said that if I initiate something, she wouldn't say no. Also, we're going to Prom together as friends, except I didn't really know we were just going as friends until she told my friend, who told me. Thats the second problem.\n\nThe second problem is that as of today, she likes another guy, and considers me really clingy but would make out with me if It didn't mean anything. She told all those things to my friend, who told me without her knowing, so she doesn't know that I know these things. Gotta love High School.\nAlso you should know how I feel about her right now: I just want to make out with her at this point, earlier I considered dating her but now since things have become stressful I don't think I could date her. I need a way of telling her that If we made out, it wouldn't mean anything beyond mutual attraction.\nTL;DR:"}

I need your help with my recent drop in \"performance\"(nsfw)\nPOST: Ok Reddit help me out, this is embarrassing but I will ask anyway.  I am 25 and in a sorta new relationship. Everything is great with the exception of one problem. With this girlfriend my sexual stamina has plummeted. I'm talking 3 minutes of fun and done, I haven't had this little control since I was 16, American Pie style premature ejaculation. She doesn't seem to mind and does the whole \"aww thats so cute\" (which makes me feel oh so manly) Furthermore, even the second and third time we get it on I have the same issues. This is upsetting because this was my previous Ace when all else failed. To make matters worse, *right* before we started dating I went through a string of emotionless hookups where *I* had problems finishing. \n\nSo help me reddit. I am at wits end. Like I said, when I first started sex yeah this happened. But that changed with experience and I got pretty fucking good (no proof, but you'll just have to believe me.) Sure I wasn't always on my A game but I have never been this consistently bad with any girl ever. \n\nSo is it medical? Am I just psyching myself down?  Any and all advice would be appreciated.  Maybe share stories of commiseration or maybe give me some super secret awesome reddit sex tips (that help me last longer than 2 minutes.) If you give tips please stay away from anything learned in your first 5+ years of sex because **none of those** work for me anymore. \n\nI doubt anybody will see this, but I would appreciate any responses you guys can give.\nAlso please pardon my puns, they were unavoidable.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not super into cats, but I'm not against the idea and it could be fun.\n\nGoing through names for fun, she just can't accept that I will not have a cat called Rasputin, or Anastasia or some other bullshit name. When I suggest a name, it's just immediately shut down for one reason or another. For example, I suggest Henry (pronounced like the hoover) as an homage to my favourite footballer, Theirry Henry, and she initially was warm to the idea before finding out the reasoning, then of course said no.\n\nIt's driving me mad, I don't want to like go on holiday for a week and be like, \"hey mate can you look after my cat, Anastasia? Real cool gal you'll love her\", or \"oh that's my cat, fucking Jemima\".\n\nI just want to have an input in the naming decision seeing as we'll hopefully have the thing for the next 10+ years right?

(she's so metal)\n\nI think she is a bit shy, i get that because of her posture and the way she reacts when you ask her a question (she responds the quickest way possible and never has eye contact), she likes Metal (i love it) and reading probably. (i like to read sometimes, depending on the book)\n\nHer name is Nur and she is from Tunisia (i live in Italy), that's all i got from her.. she doesnt know anything about me, she didnt ask anything, but i managed to let her let me listen to her music.\n\nI just dont know how to approach her, she is awkward and i'm awkward and i'm afraid it might get really awkward, i dont see her everyday, the bus is full of people and it's impossible to get to her if she's far away, in the afternoon on the way back she's usually with a friend, i tried talking about music a couple of times but it didnt go well, maybe i didnt do it well enough.\n\nI'm not good with girls, i'm not good with people in general, and i dont know what to do.\n\nP.S.

So now, I'm being more proactive with making sure everyone (including me) has fun, rather than worrying about stuff.\n\nI never liked the idea of online dating, but it might help me make female friends (95% of my friends are guys) and help with relationships.

I was from a different school, didn't really care, started dating her, and she came to trust me a lot, and I let her.

I mean, come on.\n\nI was trying to play it safe and not seem like I was attracted to her friend, so I kept picking my girlfriend to choose truth or dare. It quickly gets to the point where I dare my girlfriend to get naked. She bowed out, chose truth instead, game kept going. I start running out of things to ask/dare my girlfriend, so I start picking her friend to do truth or dare. I wanted to see her naked, at some point I dared her to do it, she quickly stripped butt ass naked in my girlfriend's room. Later that week I broke up with my girlfriend who trusted me enormously to start dating her hot friend. Like an idiot, I thought honesty was a good idea.

This girl is currently planning on moving out east for 6 months at the end of January and has said she wants to go out there single and to work on herself. The reason she want to move away is that she's even depressed for about the last 2 years of her life. Here comes the actual problem. I've been fine with dealing with her depression and wanting to keep it nice and light but what I can deal with is that she is keeping me/our relationship a complete secret from her family/friends/ex who she sees bi weekly and has said she still has feelings for him but broke up with him because she was unhappy with herself being in a relationship. \n\nSo I'm thinking I should just pull the plug on this now? The problem is we get along amazingly and have so many thing and ideals in common that the chemistry is quiet good.

How do we console her?\nPOST: This morning (Sep 18th, 2016) there was a car accident on the road we live on, and this afternoon my parents and I discovered the only fatality was one of my little sister's classmates. My sister and her friend had known each other since kindergarten, half of their young little lives and were very close. My sister herself is an intelligent kid, heavily extroverted and makes friends very easily. She isn't afraid to stand up to kids if they bully her and is overall outstanding socially. But we're very afraid that this could change, and her personality and state of mind could be horribly affected.\n\nWe haven't told her because we want her to get a good night's sleep. The school will have grief counseling for a few days but beyond that we're in the dark about what will happen. She will notice that one of her friends is missing tomorrow, and the school is likely to tell them anyways.\n\nI've dealt with depression for many years, but for different reasons. I know the pain it causes and the mindset it creates is very negative (I became very cynical and mistrusting of others, insecure even). We don't want that in her. This could be different if she was older and in her teens, but she's still in elementary. She barely even has an understanding on the concept of death. She's still \"innocent\", and we have no idea what we can really do to help her.\n\n===============================\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How can I [24 F] not become a booty call with my date [31 M] when I want a relationship?\nPOST: I've been on two amazing dates with a guy I'll call Alex [31 M]. We met on OkCupid. His entire profile is oriented around wanting a relationship, marriage and kids, which is good, because I want a serious relationship.\n\nWe have had an amazing connection and agree on many, many things. On our second date, we went beyond making out and fooled around a little and did oral, but he did not perform oral on me and we did not have sex. This is fine - I just don't like to take it any further than that until more of a relationship has been established, my personal preference, but I'm fine with some fooling around.\n\nSo after I left out last date, we decided we'd see each other next today, Sunday. I was thinking we would be able to go to a baseball game around 2pm. However, he just texted me and said he has to work a little today and won't be free till 6:30, but I should come over, and am welcome to stay the night, and that he's excited to see me.\n\nI am not looking for a booty call. I realize we messed around on our last date, but I explicitly told him this is as far as I am comfortable going for now.\n\nI texted him back and said, \"Hey handsome! Let's go do something fun tonight, how about a sunset picnic at the park?\" and he replied and said, \"Perfect, what would you like to eat?\" so now we're working out those details.\n\nHow can I stop this from becoming a booty call situation? Has he already put me in that category? Can I salvage this? Should I avoid his place entirely? It seems silly because we have already messed around and I'm fine doing that again, not progressing to sex, but I don't want that to be the center of our activities. What do I do tonight?\nTL;DR:"}

I still want to salvage what I had.\nPOST: A Little background, I have know her my entire life (yes all 16 years I know I'm a bit young to ask for \"relationship\" advice but I wanted a second opinion). We have only been close for the past three years or so. She was the only person to saw me not a fat, unhygienic, antisocial person I was but as a goofy kid with problems of my own. We grew very close other the years and so did my crush on her. \n\nSo this started a few days ago. I was getting pretty down on myself; It's mid summer vacation and I've only seen her a handful of times. She is really the only person I talk to outside my family so I was feeling pretty alone. So I text her asking what's happening between us and why she hasn't wanted to see me. To make a long story short she told me that she was getting uncomfortable around me and was getting harassed by other telling her, \"He's SO in love with you, when are you going to start dating?\" She then asked if I liked her because she didn't feel the same about me. I said yes of course I love her.\n\nShe then said I should take a minute to get my emotions in check and to text her \"when I was ready\". So after a couple hours of self loathing I realized I probably have just ruined the best thing to happen to me. I just want things to get back to as close as it can to normal. But I still love her. She's is most likely the reason why I haven't hated my life for a good long time. I don't want her to leave. \n\nShould I try to stop loving her or should I just try to go back to the way things were? How do I even stop loving someone when I want them to stay in my life? I know the whole, \"When you leave your high school nothing with matter\" but that's not now. I'm scared of losing what I have now.\nTL;DR:"}

I've caught him in a few lies (and I can't tell WHY he's lying, which makes it more suspicious).  He can be verbally abusive sometimes.  There are certain things I've communicated that I need him to do in our relationship and he agrees but then simply does whatever he wants.\n\nI guess I've stayed this long because I'm in deep with him, I do love him and he allows me a lifestyle I could never afford on my own.

The things troubling me most are what I have learned about religion and sexuality in relation to (straight)men.\n\nI have never had trouble with my own sexuality. My parents and school educated me about sexuality in an open and scientific format. As I became a young adult sexuality was a larger part of politics and I wanted to know why certain things were a debate (homosexual & transsexual  rights, stem cell research, abortion).\n\nI started to educated myself on the science of the issues. Why are stem cells being researched, and what are the potential benefits? How are homosexuals different from straight people (biologically)? How are transgender people different than homosexuals (again biologically)? \n\nI began to have stronger and stronger beliefs in regards to women, homosexual, and transsexual rights. When I educated myself more about the politics rather than the science I could see it was religious issues that effected women/transsexual/homosexual rights. I started to wonder, if religion had never happened, would access to abortion and birth control still be an issue? If religion had never happened, would homosexuals and transsexuals still have limited rights and resources?\n\nI bring up all these points because everything I have learned so far casts men in a terrible light. Men have predominantly lead Christianity and religion throughout history, leading to men predominantly leading politics. Further, most violent crimes are committed by men. Most serial killers are men. Most child molesters and pedophiles are men. \n\nI don't want this to be a big (straight)man hating post. I have met plenty of good, kind men in my life.  I know not all men are the same. My questions are: Is it common in a young women's life to catch onto these issues and become dismayed? Is it common to have negative feeling towards men in general (without personal history of abuse/assault)? I know it's not right, but I do feel discriminatory towards men. I'm not sure I can move forward from what I have learned so far with a positive or even open attitude towards straight men.\nTL;DR:"}

We have tried to let him just CIO with timed check ins - but aren't comfortable with it, as he gets so intensely upset that he is hoarse and shakes for a good while after we've gone in to check on him.  He also doesn't stop crying when we check on him - it almost gets worse.    Just today as well he started to roll from back to stomach and is all over his crib because he is just going insane in there.  \n\nI guess our challenge is how do we get him to self-soothe when we are putting him down awake and he loses it EVERY time.   \nThe rocking and/or nursing seems to be the only way he will nap in the crib.   \n\nWe do have a nap routine and bed routine that we do, the room is TOTALLY dark, we have white noise, it is a good environment.

I walk him and play with him, but its always on a leash. This was due to him wondering off and completely ignoring me when off leash. Final straw was staring at a car coming down the road and never even attempting to get out of the road. (driver stopped and he didn't get hit) He suddenly yesterday went all excited in the house and was brought outside to me as I was cutting down a tree. He simply wanted to see me. He sat by my feed hugged me with one leg and wanted to be petted. normal behavior for him as of late, but he doesn't normally need to come out and see me like that. So, I took a chance and removed the leash. I threw his toy  (rope toy) for about 30 minutes until he was panting hard and I knew it was break time. Never once did he even attempt to run off or leave my sight. Later that night I was interested and so I brought him out again and over to my neighbors house (no dogs, but 2 kids). Again, wanted to play and run around. Same outcome of not leaving my sight or running off to visit a neighbors dog. He was neutered about 6 months ago and that was done to hopefully stop him from visiting the lady dogs in the area. It had no immediate effects at that time, but it seems like he is interested now in behaving. Is this normal behavior for a dog to suddenly just have commands click after months of training and being leash bound? I just wanted to know if this is normal and will it continue? I am going to keep walking him on the leash, but I would like to keep having fun play times with him if he can be trusted to not run across the roads. Play time was the main reason I got him to begin with, so this is looking great to me! Any information or suggestions appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

On the other hand, I kind of want to talk to her about reasons she broke up with me and ways I can address those problems.\n\nI was not expecting the break-up at all.  I think part of why she dumped me is she was tired of me not having a job.  I have since gotten a job (more for my sake because I needed one than because of her) and I really want to talk to her about the ways I am trying to improve myself not only for me but in a way that could help our relationship if we were to get back together.  \n\nThe break-up was pretty amicable considering the bad timing, and I never got the impression that she felt any significant resentment toward me, but she completely refuses to talk to me now. I know it's probably unreasonable for me to expect to have a chance for us to get back together, but I feel like I at least would like to talk to her - we haven't really talked at all since the break-up.  I'm respecting her wishes in not trying to get in touch with her or see her, but I'm constantly fighting the urge to ask her if we can talk sometime.  \n\nI don't know exactly what my question is - I guess in short it has to do with whether or not I should try to get in touch with her or should just accept she doesn't want to have any contact with me and move on.\nTL;DR:"}

I've heard he has a crush on me so I know he likes me at least to some degree. But gosh, when he looks at me I get so tense. It's crazy. I just need to know, has this happened to anyone else!?

I only gave a handjob to the second guy. \n\nThe first guy (25M) got sick of waiting for me to get comfortable before proceeding to everything below the waist; he and I never got around to physical exclusivity or a relationship, and I didn't feel comfortable doing anything below the waist with him prior to those two things (physical exclusivity for handjobs/fingering and a relationship for blowjobs/sex). When he ended things with me, he said some really hurtful things about how I should go faster in the bedroom due to my age. \n\nWith the second guy (27M), I decided go a bit faster physically. I felt comfortable enough to relax around him (with the first guy, I kept tensing up) so on the third date, I just went for it and gave him a handjob. He didn't know that I didn't have any experience with them, and I had no idea what I was doing so I'm sure it wasn't the best handjob he's ever gotten by any means.

He was adamant on me not drinking since I wasn't mature enough, but I wouldn't relent. But by the 30th, I had pretty much given up. \n\nWell the day of the party arrives, and the family and I go and I had pretty much forgotten about wanting to drink there.\n\nAn hour into the party, the host of the party comes over to me while I'm texting on the couch and asks if I want a drink. Being honest, I told him I wasn't allowed but he promised he wouldn't tell my dad and it would only be a shot. How could I refuse? I quickly downed the shot (Which tasted pretty awesome) and went back to my business.\n\nFast forward several hours, as we're all back home from the party and I'm asleep, I'm awoken to the urge to take a shit, BADLY. This is completely out of the ordinary, since I never need to take a shit in the middle of the night, but it's too strong to ignore. I run into the bathroom and have the biggest shit in the world, so big in fact, I pass out.\n\nI wake up around noon to find myself in the same place I was last conscious, the bathroom, but noticed a slip of paper shoved inside the bathroom door. It was from my dad.\n\n\"laxativesthrowaway,\n\nI told you that you couldn't drink at the party and I wanted to see how much I could trust you. I had my friend spike the shot he gave you with a good dosage of laxatives. Judging from your current position, I'd say it worked pretty well.\n\nI expect you cleaned up and ready for today, you will be solely responsible for cleaning up the Christmas decorations while the rest of us go out for some shopping.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/cats\nTITLE: Stray cat that I plan to take in. How do I make sure she survives the winter?\nPOST: Hi guys,\n\nSo my family recently bought a property out in the middle of nowhere, and (unbeknownst to us), it \"came with\" a stray cat that the previous owner had been feeding. This cat is wonderful. She's a little timid at first, but I've been really going out of my way to gain her trust and I've absolutely fallen in love with her. She's not declawed, I haven't checked to see if she's fixed, and she looks fairly young (all of her teeth are in amazing condition and her coat is slick). She's definitely considerably underweight, so I don't suspect she belongs to anyone - I feel like she would be heavier if another person was feeding her - but I haven't taken her in to see if she's microchipped yet. If she isn't, then I'm going to take her in as my own pet.\n\nThe issue is, I can't take her in until next fall. I'm a sophomore in college and still living in on campus housing. My parents don't really like cats, and even though they're fond of this one, they're still not willing to take her inside. I know living outdoors is really dangerous for cats and I'm worried that she might not make it to next year, especially if this winter is as bad as it was last year. \n\nWhat can I do to increase the likelihood that she'll make it until next summer? How can I provide for her throughout the winter without actually letting her in the house? My parents have a few outbuildings that they said they would let her stay in, but they're not insulated well and I don't know if it would be appropriate to just lock her in a garage. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

After realizing that dogs shed a lot and pee a lot when not trained, they decided it would be best to keep the dog outside all the time. There is one problem though: we are in Georgia where it gets in the hundreds every day. The only attention the dog gets is when he gets fed and gets water. Also, their mom is traveling all the time now and she stays with her grandmother. While my girlfriend and I are at college, who do you think takes care of the dog? Exactly, no one.\n\nI want to take the dog to college with me. I have a house with a huge backyard and a lot of experience with animals. My schedule permits me to be home a lot to housetrain him. My roommates are also very experienced with having dogs so that is not an issue either. \n\nDiscussions with her about the dog have gotten nowhere, even though she seems to not care about it unless someone asks what kind of dog she has and she gets to proudly tell people she has a husky.\nTL;DR:"}

Come October 2013 we were officially a couple and going out and went strong through my senior year (her junior year) and then on to my freshman year at a nearby community college. When she graduated she elected to go to a teaching school about 45 min away, not too far and even my sister went there. \n\nHowever, both never seeing each other and lack of communication led to several big fights where we almost broke up. In addition, I was very insecure(but worked on it and improved) about several issues and relied on my ex-gf too much when she already had a lot on her plate as it was. Eventually, she told me she was very unhappy not only with the current state of our relationship but also how little she saw me and how we were just growing apart. She couldn't continue to be in this any longer and couldn't see it improving. I understand this is common in relationships such as ours and she wouldn't give us one more shot even though i practically begged.\n\nThe toughest part of this break up was that i relied on her for a lot and it wasn't as if we hated each there or anything. We still love each other A TON. She apologized to me a hundred times and basically said I was all she could ask for but it was too much for her and she needed to find her own happiness and not rely on me. When were in person together nothing could have been more perfect. I love her with all my heart and would do literally anything to save this, absolutely anything. Unfortunately, i don't think anything i can do anything to fix it.\n\nSo, what I'm asking is:\n- anyway to save this at all? \n- How do i stop texting her and stop viewing her as my girlfriend?\nhow do you go from 2 years with such an amazing person to never talking to them again? I'm sick of crying i could use some help. Sadly enough, normally i would say get a new hobby, but I already work, go to school full time and play too much golf.\nThanks in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

In 2004 I was a squad leader for a team that deployed to a remote airfield in Pakistan for about 5 months, supporting different operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. While there, I was the in charge of all security operations on that airfield. From a security incident stand point, I knew about and was involved with everything that occurred.  That deployment was relatively quiet, especially compared to what other locations had to deal with. There were a few sketchy incidents, but nothing to really write home about. \n\nThere is an individual that was an under me (E-4). He/she was a member of my squad and I'd known him/her for quite a while before that deployment. He/she was a good enough troop, known to occasionally peddle a little bullshit but nothing serious.\n\nFast-forward to now. The individual has started a charity that helps US servicemen/women with PTSD. The charity has been gaining a reasonable amount of attention in different media circles and is helping bring more attention to the issues that returning solders face. \n\nThe dilemma is the individual is using his/her own \"combat\" experience to gain exposure for the charity. In interviews, videos, articles, etc.., he/she describes incidents that just didn't happen and claims that he/she developed PTSD as a result.  I reached out to him/her a while back, making the point that if the stories being told were ever scrutinized by the wrong people, it would do quite a bit of harm to the charity and to the overall cause. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have much effect.\n\n*Note: The charity's financials are publically available and, as far as I can tell, he/she hasn't taken a salary or received any payments from the donations.*\n\n**Question at hand:** Should I stand up and expose the exaggerations being told, thus harming the cause of taking better care of troops returning from combat? Would it be better to just remain silent and take comfort that the exaggeration is ultimately contributing to a greater good?\nTL;DR:"}

IF the bees were to stick to the field and specifically pollinate cannabis flowers- would their honey/bee wax/etc contain anything at all - and if such would it produce a physical effect?

I didn't really know how to answer their \"level of activity\" or \"proposed numbers of workouts\" questions, because though I have an office job (low activity) I live in a city and don't have a car and walk everywhere including to work every day (2 miles) and to all my errands, including lugging back whatever I have purchased.  I just told them I am \"low activity\" and plan to workout three times a week and left it at that.\n\nIt has me on a 1280 calories a day plan which is 80 more than I was planning, but decided to go for it. (When I get chubby, I usually go on 1200 a day for a few months until I trim down.)

This leads to me being able to eat even more calories according to the app (1460 to 1640). Doesn't this seem like A LOT of calories? \n\nClearly, I feel dubious about the plan it has put me on, but the rave reviews here make me think I should go for it without reservation.

Even though we live in Washington state with the age of consent being 16, we still haven't made any sexual contact or intercourse of any kind other then kissing. Our relationship have been a secret from our parents as my family is Muslim and doesn't like relationships outside of marriage and her Dad is quite strict.. too strict that she fears that if her dad finds out, he will send her back to her country as she isn't a citizen here yet. She took that risk because she liked me allot and then we started dating. We came closer and closer each day and now developing strong feeling for each other. We are practically in love now.\n\nAfter graduation, we both decided to reveal this secret to our parents. I still haven't as it will be a huge problem for me but I could deal with it. She wanted to tell her father but it was too late, her father took her phone and checked the messages and saw our conversation and he was extremely furious and took away the phone from her. We have been contacting each other from emails. She has tried persuading her dad to see reasons but her dad is in denial and wants this relationship to end even if it's 8 months long. I asked her to tell her dad to see me and talk this through with three us together but he refuses. He doesn't wants to see any reason and basically giving my girlfriend no option but to end this relationship. Obviously she doesn't want to, but has ran out of ideas on what to do. I have no clue what to do either from this point.. It's been two weeks so far, and I haven't seen my girlfriend as they are out of state to see their family member's graduation.\n\nand yeah she turns 18 in 5 months and even after that she's going to have to live with her father to maintain her immigration status, which changes in 2 years.\n\nany kind of feedback is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Pay Citi down aggressively to free up credit to transfer chunks from the higher-interest cards, thus moving large chunks of debt from 2x.xx% interest to 0% interest.\n\nWife's idea: let the current balance on Citi card coast with minimum payments, pay down other cards in order from highest-to-lowest interest as aggressively as possible.\n\nAny suggestions either way (or any options we haven't thought of)?

I realize this calls our trust into question but to be fair, we have access to each other's Facebooks so I didn't go on with the intent to snoop. \n\nI want to know if this is something I should be concerned about regardless of the fact that he says it's out of \"curiosity\".

While this is something we both want, when we're in the moment, my wife cannot let herself relax and enjoy it, to the point where things stop and everyone goes away frustrated, because she doesn't feel sexy. Our baby was almost ten pounds, and she does have some stretch marks and some loose skin on her stomach, which seems to be her main sticking point in this. I've tried everything I can think of as far as being supportive, including telling her how sexy I find her, slow build up with sexy messages through the day, waiting for the time that she wanted, but it all seems to come down to we both want to be intimate, but she just can't get into it. This same issue is eroding her self-image, where she says she's doesn't feel good about herself because of the specific issue of her stomach. She's working out most days at the gym, and we're eating healthier, but this isn't going to be a quick fix type thing, and when it comes down to it, it's really more about her self-image and confidence than anything. She knows her body won't be always exactly how she wants it to be but can't reconcile that to actually feel good about herself and let herself be intimate.\n\nThis is turning into an issue that's bleeding into other parts of our lives. We're both basically at a loss, and while we can talk about it together candidly, we can't seem to come up with anything to do other than wait, but we're both worried this could lead to a new \"normal\" for us because intimacy can be so hard to recapture sometimes.

Well, five minutes after I listed the item, I got the notification that it sold! Lo and behold, though, after telling me to ship it to them in Nigeria, and sending me fake emails that looked like they were from Paypal and eBay (which I forwarded to spoof@Paypal.com and spoof@ebay.com, by the way.), I went onto my account and completely deleted the transaction. I didn't know what else to do, as they had marked the laptop as paid for already. I didn't really think much of it after that, until today. I got an email from eBay telling me that I owed money to them for selling my laptop. It's for about $31. I simply do not have this money, and I don't think I should be obligated to pay it, as I never sold the laptop. How can I get this cancelled?

He's the most attractive man that I've ever been with.\n\nHowever, he recently came back from a month-long trip for work and I think he's experiencing some depression being back in our small town. He's from NYC, goes there for work one month a year, and always gets down for a little while upon returning to the small southern town we are stuck in until his research assignment is over in a few years.\n\nDue to this, he's taking less care of his appearance.

I had asked him to join me for dinner, so that I could voice all my concerns and how I've been feeling lately in respect to him. He said we should cook something together instead, which I wasn't too keen on because he always delays any of my requests to talk by saying he'll do that during an activity which never plays out in my favour. In any case, I told him I'm not too keen on cooking together because I really just want to talk. Which set him off, saying I constantly critique him/am negative, which just discourages him and makes him not want to try.\n\nI ask myself, how does he 'try'? We made a schedule beginning of the year of when we'd see each other, and for how long each week. We mostly follow this schedule so far, thing being he'll literally just be there. For example, we're scheduled to work out together? It'll end with me working out alone, and him reading something while on the bike at the other end of the gym. Or doing schoolwork in the lobby while I work out. He still has the nerve to make me feel bad, painting me out to be the villain and say he's trying really hard to make me happy?\n\nCall me crazy, but being in the same room but doing our own things is not 'together time'. When I try to discuss it, it's like a vicious cycle of him complaining that I'm not satisfied with his 'efforts', followed by me saying I'm sorry that I'm making a fool of myself and practically begging him to spend more time being affectionate/close with me.

The SUV is so close that the passenger mirror clips the guards shoulder and 'snaps' closed.

I was close enough to jump in and stop him (I pushed him back) and he ran over and grabbed a traffic cone and came at the guard again.  By this time, the other guard had rushed over and it was clear the two guards had this guy handled so as SUV idiot continued to push and scream, I took advantage of the chaos and grabbed his fancy rear window wiper, snapped it off at the base and kept walking across the street.

Seeing that he's currently abroad, so it's easy, since we physically can't see one another. I went to visit him and when I came back to the states, I was in a very deep depression, so I was more negative than I usually am and I'm still struggling to cope with it months later. After a few weeks of being home and having no one to lean on, but him, he got fed up with me and decided to end the relationship after months of telling me that no matter what happens to us he would always love me. He sent a message stating that he had given up on me and essentially deleted me from his life by removing me from every form of communication. He basically told me to go fuck myself. Every day since I've had him on my mind, wondering how he's doing and if he's even thought of me and not knowing is killing me inside. Anytime that I think about him or what he said to me, I cry. It's like a knee jerk reaction. I miss and love him so much and I don't know what to do anymore. He's the first man I've ever said \"I love you\" to and him likewise to me. He means the absolute world to me and I can't lose him. We had agreed upon June 4th as the day our break would be over, which also happens to be our anniversary. Can anyone help me?\nTL;DR:"}

Unfortunately, my parents weren't as smart as others to take care of their illegal status until it was too late. My sister and I are currently 25-24 and were not able to receive a residency from ours parents when they got theirs. Only person who was able to is my younger sister who was around 18 when they decided to finally do it.\n\nMy sister and I are currently stuck. Passports are expired and we have no forms of identification. As others would say, our only chance to move forward, is to marry a Citizen of the United States. I've been with my fiance for 3 years now. Last week when we decided to marry, we couldn't ... my passport is currently expired and here in FL, the only Venezuelan embassy has closed down.\n\nMy question to you reddit is, what can I do to be able to marry? Is there another way in which I could renew my passport? The only options i've found consist in traveling to other states. If that's my only option, there that's what i'll do, but if there is anything else, please let me know!\nTL;DR:"}

It's just a dangerous idea, so i usually avoid it altogether.\n\nHowever, due to my extreme extroversion I have a tendency to be extra friendly to people, male or female, and especially new folks to make them feel welcome in the company. Recently a coworker approached me and stated that another female coworker felt I had been hitting on her at work (she even has a SO, so hell NO i'm not hitting on her -____-). The coworker came to my defense, and attempted to tell the woman that I am just a friendly person. However, this woman did not believe said person. I'm not too worried at this point, a simple change in attitude towards her should fix this situation.\n\nHowever, this troubles me for future situations. In a big corporate environment, misunderstandings like this could damage my reputation, cost me possible raises, promotions, and even a job. I don't want to change my personality for the sake of entitled people who think i am trying to make an advance on them at work. My words are very precise, and I would never say anything legitimately inappropriate, but i worry about people that inadvertently (or purposefully) read between the lines.\n\nHow does an extremely outgoing person accomplish this without sacrificing my natural personality?\n\nMany thanks...\n\nAge: mid 20's for both parties\nLength of relationship = nonexistent\nTL;DR:"}

Granted, things were kinda on a slant at the end, which I was denying a little bit and trying to make things better. It wasn't this entirely out of the blue thing, and it wasn't so much \"getting dumped\" as it was mutually understand, but kinda more on her end then mine. It really sucked to lose my lover *and* my best friend simultaneously. The break-up wasn't messy, but things were a bit ambiguous in the end, just establishing that we needed time apart, leaving me a bit unsure if it was a \"break\" or a \"break-up\".\n\nSo, I dealt with it, and it was really rough for a while, but after talking with a lot of people, I got my shit together and decided that I wanted either a) closure or b) to get back together.\n\nSo, I called her, asked to meet up (I had some things of hers to return too), and we grabbed coffee and talked. Obviously, things didn't go exactly as I'd hoped they would, but it was cathartic. It felt good to see her, even if it wasn't what I really wanted in the end. I got home and felt pretty decent for a while, but now I feel bad.\n\nI know how she is (liberated woman, college, likes to party), but it's just little things that kinda keep pinging that knot in my stomach like \"I don't think we could have fixed it if we tried\" and \"I feel like being alone for a bit\" and \"I don't feel bad talking to other guys anymore\". It's just that ouch of I feel like she moved on really quickly and, obviously, thoughts of her sleeping with other guys sucks too, on top of my awkward ass not getting laid any more (maybe a bit of a jealousy issue :/).\n\nIt's nice to have my friend back and not have our friend group be broken as it was when we weren't talking, but it's still a little sorer than I thought I'd be.\nTL;DR:"}

Trevor and I dated for around 18 months, during which time he was subtly abusive, but not in a way I was aware of at the time, eg. making me feel bad for not working out, insisting that I wear makeup constantly, dictating my purely platonic friendships with males, you know the drill. \n\nDuring the end of that relationship, I met current BF and began developing very strong feelings for him, which made me realise that my current relationship was a pile of shit, to say the least. So I break things off with Trevor, and proceed to pursue a relationship with current BF. Almost immediately after breaking up with him, he proceeds to tell me his true opinion of me and admits that he only dated me out of pity and because he thought I'd be an easy fuck (we never slept together, so joke's on him). I'm also almost entirely sure he was cheating on me, though he never confirmed that, as he was incredibly secretive. \n\nSo now I've been dating current BF and things are wonderful, except that I'm still not able to fully trust him after that last hot mess. He's so patient with me, he puts in so much effort and constantly makes me feel beautiful and tells me he loves me for who I am. I know that we're young, but this relationship is one of the most stable, mature, loving relationships I've ever seen, let alone been in.

The recent decriminalization of marijuana in CT hit national news and the front page of reddit. All of those in support of this bill, what is your reasoning? Are you supportive of the bill in hopes that now you can get high legally or that the bill will encourage your state to pass the same bill? Or are you in favor of the bill because of the initiative that it represents to reform the current drug policy in the U.S. that is ineffective? Please be honest, I want to know. \n\nI am concerned that too many people are in favor of this bill because it would enable them to avoid some of the consequences that are accompanied by using marijuana. My fear is that once marijuana becomes legalized, not just decriminalized, the public will abandon the effort to reform, or better yet eliminate, the current drug policy. This would be a huge set back in the movement that so many people have worked hard to initiate. \n\nAlso, any redditors who live in countries that have made the initiative toward new drug policies, please describe how you view their effects.

About a month and a half ago I met a female coworker \u2013 let's call her \"Kristen\" \u2013 at a new job.  We immediately hit it off; she is smart, literary, into the same music and books as me, and extremely attractive.  I was very troubled by my feelings for the week after I met her.  I found myself thinking about her more than my wife, and occasionally visualized us having sex.  Very quickly, when my rationality kicked in, these thoughts stopped. \n\nThe relationship between Kristen and I has settled into a very close, but purely platonic, friendship.  I truly believe that it was no hallmarks of an emotional affair: the sexual attraction is gone, and I don't hide any details of my friendship from my wife.\n\nIn high school and college, I was \"friend zoned\" by nearly every girl that I was romantically interested in.  This had profound effects on my self-esteem.  My wife, who I met in graduate school, was one of the first women to be romantically and sexual attracted to me.  Obviously, I married her for other reasons, but that gave me a boost.  It shouldn't matter, but I still have this nagging feeling that women don't find me \"sexy\" when they look at me.  I know that's a potential red flag \u2013 but I'll deal with that later.\n\nBefore I ask her I would preface it by telling her that I am asking purely out of curiosity, and this has no bearing on the here and now.  If I asked Kristen this question, I recognize that it would be purely to stroke my ego.  Is this the kind of thing that would really freak out a woman and cause her to pull back on the friendship?\nTL;DR:"}

Long story short he was living in [name of state] and moved back after his wife told him she no longer had feelings for him (STILL baffles me, this dude is seriously the nicest person I've ever met) Obviously it sucks, but I'm glad to see him back and we continue the conversation.\n\nAfter a few minutes we start talking about my life, and what's my big news? I got married of course! I, being the already socially awkward person that I am, start talking about how I'm only getting married once because the process of getting married is difficult itself; Changing your name,drivers license, etc... And jokingly of how I'm only getting married once because it's so annoying.\n\nAt this point my lunch break was over so I had to clock back in. I told him I would be back but when I returned he was nowhere in sight. I'm assuming he just left. I then realized there was a strong possibility I unintentionally upset him talking about only being married once. He's supposed to start on Monday next week so if I don't hear from him before that I message him on Facebook and apologize.  I'll keep you updated!\nTL;DR:"}

This is the first time we have been long distance. This is entire school year he has brought up having an \"open relationship\". I put this in quotes because really it has just been him suggesting things such as FFM threesomes, swinging, or even him in a FMM threesome. I do not doubt that he loves me and that he wants to be with me, which he has expressed many times. However honestly, I just think that he wants to experience having sex with someone besides me since that has never happened. We are pretty serious and the possibility of staying together down the road is very real. He has also told me that he really just doesn't want to miss out on the experience of having multiple sex partners. \n\nI could really use some advice on how to go about this.

He's actually been open about talking about what he wanted for his birthday when I asked him before, and didn't seemed phased by turning 30 at all. In fact, he's the type that usually considers his  birthday as just a normal day, but with cake and presents. \n\nToday, I posted on Facebook about how I was proud and happy to have such an awesome big brother, etc, with pictures of us as kids.

If a man would rather drive a car than a truck, he's a queer. There's a difference between a black person and a Nigger. Gun control laws are actually just to hurt deer hunters.

And well, I don't know - we had a big fight and I started breaking down and she asked me if I was in love with her, and all I could say was \"I don't know\" - since then, other friends of mine have told me that I wasn't in love with her so I told her that, but I think it's because they don't know the full extent of the story. I really want to make her happy because she makes me so happy... and I just want to hold her and be like a couple with her. I don't know. I'm scared, I don't want to be in love with her. But everything points to yes, right?\nTL;DR:"}

They cannot stand the idea of my GF because of her religion. Both my parents broke down crying saying that they didn't expect this and that this is not what they wanted from me. Seeing them cry caused me to tear us as well.  \n\nThis is when they gave me the ultimatum.\n\nThey told me to to chose either them or her. \n\nI love her. I can't imagine my day without her. I don't want to give her up.\n\nIf I chose her my parents will pull out financial support from me. I can handle this I have been prepared for this. But what they added on was that they would take my sister [7F] and move back to India so that they can \"at least hold on to her\". I would never see her again if they can help it. I can't live like that. I want my sister to grow up with me around here in the US. Since we are all US citizens it would take some time before they moved back but they will do it.\n\nI can't throw away my sister like that. I know that even though I have been with my GF fro 1.5 at my age the relationship has a significant chance to fail.\n\nAt the same time even if I chose my family I know that I can never live how they want and they will throw this ultimatum again in a few years when I find a girl that isn't to their liking.\n\nI have no idea what to do and I need to give an answer by Thursday(Feb 6).\n\nI cannot straight up chose her.

Am I settling or being negative?\nPOST: I have been with my boyfriend for over 3 years now. We met in college sophmore year. He has always been shy & introverted - but not in a bad way. He likes to be independent and keep to himself a lot and doesn't have many more than a few close friends. Him and his family aren't that close and he is an only child. I, on the other hand, am the complete opposite. Very outgoing and sociable. I love meeting new people and my life revolves around my siblings, cousins, and friends! \n\nThe past 3 years have been great. We're both different but compatible. When we're alone, he's talkative and fun and I love spending time with him. But whenever we're around other friends or other people in general, he becomes closed off. Before him, I was in relationships with those charming and life of the party type of guys. So when we're with other people and I see the way he is, I start thinking about if I can see myself with him in the future. I want someone who can really get along with my friends and family because they will always be a big part in my life. \n\nalso: my friends and family really like him because of how considerate and sincere he is. But they also tell me that they have a hard time connecting with him or having deep conversations. \n\nI know he's crazy about me, as I am too. But I see it as a huge flaw in him and wonder if I would be happier with someone more outgoing and energetic. At the same time, I wonder if I'm being a complete bitch and overlooking all the positive aspects of our relationship? Am I supposed to automatically just \"know\" if i want to spend the rest of my life with him (as many people say..) and if i don't know after 3 years is that a bad sign?\nTL;DR:"}

I make a decent salary so it's not that big of a deal. \n \n\nFast forward to August, her and her babies father are finally being civil to each other. Which is finally a relief.  Monday I was looking over the cell bill online and noticed her text message usage had skyrocketed. So, I made the stupid mistake of browsing who she had been texting. I know I should not have done that, but something in me could not fight off the urge to look. The numbers showed that she had been texting her babies father.

I know what your thinking that's its probably a little too bit early to be thinking that and usually I would agree, but I've lived the single life and there's nothing there for me I haven't experienced I liked.

I also have stomach issues so this ensures I won't have problems while I'm not at home in the comfort of my own bathroom/house. As with any new workplace, I didn't know what to expect from lunch. I know at some places where I've worked people do lunch at staggered times, some people all go out to lunch together at the same time, some people eat at their desk and chill, etc. I was hoping I'd be able to do something independent so that no one would see me eat, and no one would realize I eat snacks like a pre-schooler brings in their lunchbox. It's really embarrassing.\n\nFirst day, I ate alone and all was fine. Second day, a girl saw me eating alone and invited me to eat with her. I went with her because I thought she meant literally just her, turns out she brought me to a huge table with 9 people. I was so utterly uncomfortable. I pecked at a few of my snacks and 2 people asked if I was starving and why I forgot my lunch. People also offered me money to go walk somewhere and get lunch or to have a bite of their meals. This is one of my worst nightmares in terms of social situations. \n\nSo today, I decided just to not take a lunch break because I felt uncomfortable sitting alone again and acting as if I didn't want to be friends with my new co-workers.

Things were more or less stable up until the Summer.\n\nThat said, this year things really started to fall apart for us, partially due to the distance, and partially due to the general lack of future direction (I'm close to finishing college, she's not sure what she wants to do, etc). She ended up asking for a lot more freedom than I was comfortable with, and all in all things weren't going great in terms of communication or stability.\n\nCut to this Summer, where I was able to spend a little time at home before leaving again for an internship out of the state. On our last day together, she prompted a conversation in which we spoke about how we might be better off as friends (lack of mutual passions, distance, etc etc), and she asked to end things. We ended them. I left, and we only spoke sparingly for a few days, myself starting to try and move on. Three days into being single, I discovered she'd met someone online the first day I was gone, and had since been on a date and slept with him. She mostly intimates that this is just a distraction for her, that she knows it's too soon, that it's her way of coping with the break-up, but it's tearing me apart just to think about it, and I'd really like to get past the pain. \n\nSo, fellow redditors, how do I deal?

I have been doing everything to make it up to her and get her to truly forgive me. Last week she took a new job that has her working Monday through Friday 8-4. I thought it would be great because we would see each other every night but instead she is extremely depressed  that I am spending all the time with the girls and not her. Now she wants to quit her job even though we can't afford it.\n\nNow I know this recent depression/anger had all to do with our prior fighting and my porn problems. She doesn't see me as a fit father anymore I believe and I want to know how to make things better for us and our daughters.\nTL;DR:"}

How can I resolve this situation?\nPOST: My wife is from another country (we met while I was working there), and she just arrived in my country after a hellish visa process. We were apart for over a year, and naturally, masturbation happened on both our sides. She's much less experienced sexually than I am, but we're very open and comfortable with each other sexually. We had Skype sex often and we frequently discuss new things we'd like to try in bed. I've told her I watch porn sometimes, she's told me the same, and we've even discussed watching porn together.\n\nThe other day, she was downloading something on my computer and found a few porn pics I didn't realize I had in my downloads folder. They were very vanilla pics, only one nude woman even, but she completely lost it. I understand feeling a little hurt or jealous, even though we had discussed those things and she said she had no problem with it. Being confronted with the reality of it is different than just knowing I look at porn sometimes, so I get if she has some reaction. But she's threatening to leave me, she says I'm sick in the head, and she's says that she can't accept it. She's been in bed weeping for the last 24 hours, only stopping to scream at me.\n\nI've apologized, I've mentioned how we talked about porn and it wasn't an issue, I've told her that I rarely looked at porn anyway and I haven't since she got here a few months ago (which is true because of no alone time), but nothing seems to change her mind.\n\nAm I wrong to think this is an overreaction? Am I wrong to not feel guilty at all about this? Any advice on how to approach a conversation with her would help, because nothing seems to be working.\nTL;DR:"}

As part of the advanced selection process, they will be conducting a very thorough background check on him. Part of this process involves the city sending officers to his house (which is also my house) to \"inspect\" it for signs he is not fit for police work. I have no idea how extensive this search will be. I have an unregistered handgun (inherited from relative) and some rarely used marijuana paraphernalia lying around. I plan to relocate these items before the search. My main concern is pirated media. My computers contain some music, movies and games that weren't necessarily obtained through legitimate sources.

My ex was really emotionally reckless with me and I ended up waiting around for a really long time thinking he was getting serious about our relationship only to have realized I was wasting my time for absolutely nothing. \n\n\t\nI recently started dating this guy who's really great and I'm still coming to terms with what exactly 'dating' means. I've never been the type to date multiple guys at once, coming from a broken family as a child with an unfaithful parent. I totally get that seeing multiple people is the whole point of dating, but I guess that's just something I have to get my mind around. \n\nSo my new guy, makes time to see me every day whether it's a few minutes before the gym, or for five hours after work, or for an entire day over the weekend. When we go out, whether it's out for drinks or to the store for groceries, he's publicly affectionate with me (hand holding, kisses, etc.) We've been really honest from the start, he did put it out on the table that he's dating other women. To be fair, I did also say that I never have dated multiple guys at once, which he said that if things obviously got serious with us, the other girls he was dating would be out of the picture. \n\nIt's only been a few weeks, but I really like the guy. I'm not sure if it's too soon to bring up or tell him that I'm really into him, but I find myself always bummed knowing that nights he's not with me, he's with another woman. My girlfriends are telling me that I need to broaden my dating horizons and meet other people and date other guys, but that's just not who I am and I don't want to do that.  I'm afraid I might be setting myself up for another ''waiting game'' type situation and I want to avoid that at all costs, but don't want to ruin something if I'm just being too skeptical because I was burned badly from my previous relationship.\n\nAny advice would be awesome.\nTL;DR:"}

When she puts herself to sleep, she usually does it with less than 2 minutes of crying--often none at all. But recently, she wakes up wailing 30-90 minutes later. When we bounce, nurse, or otherwise help her fall asleep, she will take 2+ hour naps, 6+ hours at night.\n\nWhat's with this?? I thought that being able to put herself to sleep was supposed to help prevent her from waking up before she was done sleeping. **Should we just help her every time?** I don't want her to forget how to fall asleep on her own because I do think it's an important skill to have. We've never had to cry it out with her and we aren't interested in starting that now. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? Is it just a weird sleep regression/Wonder Week thing?

Well I turn 18 in less than 3 months, and my parents and I have spoken with oral surgeons and other dental professionals, turns out my teeth are too close together in that area and there are only two actual options. Option 1. Getting braces/invisiline for a year and then getting the bone graft and implant, this would also fix other problems in my mouth, the crowding i have on my bottom row of teeth being one of them. Personally I want to go with this option, as i see it would be better in the long run, because not only do I end up having a more stable tooth in that spot, I'd have a better smile altogether since it would fix other problems. Option 2: Getting a bridge, specifically a [Maryland Bridge] to insert a fake tooth into that place, bind it to the nearby teeth and call it a day. Sadly these bridges don't last as long compared to the implant and they are significantly less stable. My mother wants to go this route because she primarily cares about the financial aspect.

But that's not my main concern to be honest because my libido has been killed with this: one day when we were on the phone late at night and I said I miss you. I hadn't seen her in a couple weeks and she had started work and college so we've been talking less and I wanted to let her know I missed her. To my surprise she says I say that too much and I say I love you too much and basically wanted me to say it once in a while, but neither of us has really said it since. That was a couple weeks ago. \n\nThis week it was my birthday and I invited her over to a small gathering at my house and she said she'd come. However it was already getting late so I asked if she was still coming and she snapped on me. She said she can't be with me 24/7 and that I should just go look for a girl that can because she's tired of trying to make me happy. The weird part is I haven't seen her in almost a month so I was really confused. At the end of the night she texted me she missed me and that she was sorry. Also, I'm not the clingy type. \n\nSo what I came here is to ask is if I should break up with her because I'm really confused. At times I feel like I should and it's hard to find feelings for her anymore after she told me to basically stop saying I love you and I miss you. I know I'm young and that there will be other girls and stuff but every time I see a picture of us or just her, I get my feelings back and I feel like I love her and its hard to lose ALL feelings after being in this for over a year. I just need advice Reddit. Sorry for the wall of text\nTL;DR:"}

Every once in a while he gets into a mood where he tells me that he is not good enough, and their is no way he is pleasing me sexually or that he is enough. He also has massive trust issues due to baggage from family, and past relationships. We have had a few instances with lying in the past but all had been relatively minor, like timelines of relationships which we worked through. It often feels like I am on a roller coaster because I never know what may set him off.\n\nLast night he was in one of these particular moods, and I more than anything wanted him to feel good about himself. He often compares himself to my exes and asks about things we have done in the past. He asked me if I had ever taken photos for my exes like I did for him. I told him no, he ended up catching me in a lie saying that I told him in the past I had. I know it was wrong to lie to him, but I really wanted to make him feel special and I told him what I thought he wanted to hear. Now he says that he cannot trust a word I say, and have ruined all of the work that we have put into the relationship. He has basically told me that I need to prove to him that I want to be in a relationship or its over. I do not know how to prove it him, because I do love him and I want to be with him.\n\nI have also suggested we seek couples counseling, so we can both work on our problems. He absolutely refuses and just says he sorry, and I need to prove to him that I want to be in a relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

The hotel where we're holding our reception encouraged me to send out STD's right away so people will book their rooms early, since they fill up pretty quickly (we do get to reserve blocks of rooms, but only in groups of 10, and can only reserve another group of 10 when the original 10 are filled).  Our reception is from noon-5pm, and the ceremony will be at my old church literally right across the street from the hotel (so I would think it would start ~11am, but haven't sat down with the pastor yet to hammer out details).  In light of that, should I put the time of our wedding in the STD, or mention that it will be an a.m. wedding?\n\nIf I were a guest and just got a general STD card, I might only think to book a hotel room for the night of the wedding, not the night before, assuming it is likely an afternoon wedding and I'd have time to travel (especially if I were one of the many guests who have a 3.5 hour drive).  Is it okay to say something on the STD like \"late morning wedding?\" Is it also horrible etiquette to write on the STD something like, \"This hotel is really popular this time of year, so book your rooms early.\"\n  \nWe're also planning to invite a bunch of friends/family to our rehearsal dinner the night before, so maybe I could circumvent adding the time of the ceremony when that's not yet set in stone, but instead handing writing on the STD's of those guests who will be traveling far, something like, \"We would love to have you present for both the rehearsal dinner and the wedding- more details to follow!\" which might let them know to book a room for the night before.  Is that overkill?  Wait to send out the STDs until I know for sure the ceremony time?  Would love any feedback!\nTL;DR:"}

They may not send her back to school (despite paying tuition already), they want to go to family therapy, and they say I'll never love her because of what we did (we haven't said \"I love you\"). They say loads of negative things about me despite not knowing me (or getting to know me during the weekend).\n\nI get it--we fucked up. It was disrespectful to lie to them and we both regret ever even going. The truth of the matter is that neither of us wanted to back down and we were both pretty shaken by the vibe of the seedy motel and how we felt afterwards, not to mention the lying.\n\nThey've always been overbearing and disapprove of her changing from a quiet studious girl who moved around a lot as a child/teen into someone who feels secure in a location (she won't move where she spends most of her time when she is in college) and has more friends and a bigger social life. She still studies hard and works tirelessly for great grades, but her parents also don't see how much happier she has been since that change began (long before we began to date).\n\nWhat do I do now?

They also have a little \"club\" they formed, and the other girl will threaten to kick my daughter out of the club if she doesn't get the snack (I am not well-versed on the hierarchy of the club's management, and the friend may have no such official authority, but I did not find this avenue of legal questioning very useful for second-graders :-).\n\nMy daughter doesn't want a conflict, and wants to keep her friend. Their friendship is being strained by the other girl's behavior, however. I last advised my daughter tell the other girl she is sick, so can't share food for that reason - a short term solution at best, but my daughter thought it was hilarious. I also mentioned a real friend wouldn't care about a snack to be part of the club, but would care about friendship more. Still, I can't think of any good response appropriate for her age to prevent the behavior, that also teaches her positive, rather than negative, social habits.\n\nI feel this could be a valuable teaching point.

Obviously after this happened several times after talked to her about it, I could not continue on with the relationship. We broke up about a week before prom and she, understandably, flipped out. \n\nNow, during our relationship she was aware that I may or may not have been selling marijuana. Fast forward to a few months ago, she and I were on friendly terms again because we had come to an understanding on why she was so untrusting(she was cheated on in a past relationship) while we dated. This is where it gets interesting, she tells me she was questioned by our school police officer some time after we broke up.\n\n According to her, a girl(she doesn't know who) had accused me of dealing and thats why the police were investigating her. Obviously I suspect that she's the one who accused me out of anger because no other girls I know would have the motivation. She maintains that she was only questioned by the police but didn't answer any questions. We have a good friendship currently and she acts like nothing is wrong. How should I approach this with her?

For the past two years, we have lived comfortably (though not extravagantly) off of my $4,000 take home per month.\n\nThis is my current plan...let me know if I'm missing something.\n\nStep one:  Build our emergency savings back up to 10k.  We currently only have about 4k in savings (plus around 2k in checking).\n\nStep two: Pay off $4000 tax error debt that we're currently making payments on.  I don't know the exact interest on this, but it's definitely the highest out of all of our debt, including our house.\n\nStep three:  Pay off $1000 credit card debt from a new washer/dryer set we recently purchased.  This is \"same as cash\" for the first year, and we'll have it paid off before that ends.  After this, our only debt will be our house, which is 3.85% fixed.\n\nStep four:  Put $500 per month towards luxuries (vacations, new furniture, etc.)  Put the remaining $1500 towards either building up our savings further, retirement, or paying off our house faster.  I'm not sure which is the smarter play at this stage.\n\nThanks for any feedback you can provide!\nTL;DR:"}

Need some advice on some small particularities that I am not sure how to address.\nPOST: I met this guy randomly at a restaurant and he asked to stay in touch. Last night he invited me over and made some dinner. Overall the dinner was great we talked a lot he seems very genuine and we have a lot of things in common. I had a good time and would enjoy seeing him again. There is one thing that really kind of turned me off. This guy has long nails that he doesn't seem to maintain. I am very particular about nails. They really gross me out and it is something that really affects how I perceive someone. I don't want to be rude or controlling but honestly I don't think I can get physical with this guy unless he cuts and cleans his nails. I know this is weird but it is something that I really cannot look over, I generally link it to personal hygiene.

I am mainly interested in videos about social skills but anything is good. :)\nPOST: Hi all :) I spent hours scouring YouTube with my son the other night after he behaved inappropriately after losing a game. It was meant to be one quick clip about being a bad sport, but it turned into hours. We watched short clips about how to be polite, what impulsiveness is, how to behave in certain situations, how to accept no for an answer etc. (I can provide links if any one is interested- we watched so many) \n\nAfter each video we would talk about it, we would discuss what they were teaching in th video and he would tell me what he learnt and we would practise. It. Actually. Stuck. I have noticed he has been using different language and has been trying really hard to improve certain behaviours that he learnt about in the videos.\n\nHowever we hit a brick wall when I tried to find a video about body language, personal space, social cues, how to tell what emotion people were feeling etc. I am sure stuff like this exist. How do I find it? How do you teach your child about these things? Do you have any resources you could share with me? Or even how to explain these things to him?\n\nIt's worth noting I have pretty shitty social skills myself and was recently diagnosed with Aspergers. I know that I have shit social skills and it's not just me being anxious because people have made alot of comments that imply this. -I don't think I have the skills to teach him myself without a outside resource. \n\nHe doesnt see a therapist at the moment (he is 5). And no one else in his life (kindergarten teacher included) recongises my concerns and agrees with them. But I have bought it up with his teacher for next year and I will see what she thinks. He may just have very poor social skills that need working on. Anyway, I digress. The internet is the only way for me to find resurces to help him :)\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. And thank you if you took the time to reply to me.\nTL;DR:"}

We were still on cute and friendly terms although we had talked about the future. College will make things long distance. The final red flag I needed came a week ago when she proposed an open relationship, saying she thought it would give me the \"freedom I deserve\" and also keep me attached to her. I had given no indication of wanting to sleep with other people, and she had made it clear that she would never sleep with anyone else and has separation anxiety. So she wants to maintain our relationship status and have a piece of me even if it means sharing. To clarify, I was super uncomfortable with the idea of an open relationship, and I thought it would make me feel even more trapped in this relationship - which caused me to realize that I am trapped, and I've been pretty well manipulated all summer. I had resolved to break up with her, but she conveniently texted me that her period was late just a day before I was going to do it. \"Dont worry yet, but I'll give it a week and then I'll get a test.\" It is highly unlikely that she is pregnant. You guys don't need details, but we use protection and we don't take any risks. I am also aware that she has a highly irregular cycle. I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

I suppose age doesn't matter, but for reference she's 23 and I'm 27. I'm usually the type to fall for someone very quickly, but since my last relationship 3 years ago, I haven't. I'm quick to write off potential girlfriends now, of course, except for this one. I met her a year ago. I'm a regular at my neighborhood bar and she works there. I've had a huge crush on her, which she knows because I've told her. I suppose I should get to the meat and potatoes of it:\n\n * she just got out of a year and change relationship\n\n * she still lives with the ex who is supposedly moving out in a month\n\n * she's talking to/seeing someone else\n\n * we've had sex 2x and it brought me back to being a teenager, meaning I'm quick to be interested in only one round for the both of us and then wanting to go to sleep. Here, we fool around all night.\n\n * when we do hang out, it's her initiation\n\n * I've tried to get her one on one, but she had to bail because of a busy weekend where she needs her rest\n\n * she keeps saying don't get emotionally attached where she will then proceed to cuddle up against me, stroke my face, kiss me, other general signs of affection\n\n * last time we hung out she said no more kissing because she doesn't want me to get emotionally attached. No problem. As we part ways, she calls me back and plants te biggest kiss on me.\n\nI suppose I'm wondering how I can keep my head above water. I'm worried I might be viewed as a rebound. What signs would she show that she's emotionally attached? How do I stay ahead of the game? I know I don't want to jump into a relationship with her, but I would like it to lead to one. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nEnjoy your weekend everybody!\nTL;DR:"}

A little backstory, as an eighth grader I had some serious anxiety.  And when I got nervous, I vomited like a damn faucet.  My guts would hurt so bad it felt like someone was trying to wring out my intestines.  One day it got so bad I asked my mom to drive me to the emergency room because I was 99% sure I was going to die.  She sped me all the way there, and we waited for about 3 hours.  When we finally were seen, they did the whole routine with weight and all that.  The lady started asking me what my symptons were, and I explained that my stomach was in excruciating pain, I had a headache and my mouth was lactating uncontrollably.  If you are wondering what in the hell that is supposed to mean, I was talking about when your mouth starts to fill up with saliva right before you vomit everywhere.  Well I was and have been a big fan of the hodgetwins, and they always come up with funny names for things, one of which was that the way they described that salivation as lactation.  The lady chuckled a bit, and I really had no idea why. She asked if I was lactose intolerant, and that's when it hit me... Lactose... Lactate.  And then I realized that lactating most likely mean't when a female secrete's milk from their breasts.  I immediately became red faced and began to explain.  My mom started laughing, she had been letting me call it that for YEARS.  She is the same person who let me say emini (am-in-eye) instead of aren't I until I was in second grade.  I was somewhat pissed off but it's pretty funny looking back at it.\nTL;DR:"}

I met her last year at a concert with a bunch of other friends. When I broke up with my ex of 4 years last year, she was the one who always cheered me up and brought me out to parties and meeting her friends. \n\nEver since then, we've been really close to each other, talking literally every day and getting to know each other quite well. She even said \"it was rare that she got close to a person this fast\". She is quite an extrovert, very nice and open with everyone (she's a promoter, so go figure) but she tends to keep her personal stuff hidden within and only shares with people close to her.\n\nShe comes over to my place for dinner (just the two of us) regularly, cook together and go out to places to eat alone. Is it a date even if you don't explicitly say it out?\n\nShe would always comments if we didn't talk much during the day, asking how I am and where I am at all times. We've gone to the gym together and had a lot of interaction alone on many occasions. A lot of our friends (10+) have asked both of us (separately) if me and her if we were an item, cause we always act like one. She has never said like \"ew no never\" whenever it came up though. \n\nWe were asking each other questions to test each other's knowledge of ourselves and I asked \"what's my favorite  hobby?\", she replied with \"You game and study, but of course your favorite hobby is spending time with me!\" . When I asked her if it was same for her, she said \"Yeahhh, You can make lollll\". ----> Don't know what this means, the lollll throws me off. \n\nHowever based on the other reddit threads like \"what behavior is a giveaway that someone is interested\", she never gets touchy, plays with her hair, blushes, or a general change in behavior.\n\nThis makes me wonder if she thinks of me as possible candidate or just a gay best friend. Any thoughts guys? Please T_T\nTL;DR:"}

He got into eating well and going to the gym about 5 years ago, and has changed his body considerably. Now, however, he has become obsessed about going! He goes 4 days a week, after work, for about 1.5 hours. I don't think this is too much: in fact, I normally go with him. The issue isn't the quantity, it's the obsessiveness of it. He CANNOT miss a day! It doesn't matter what comes up, he has a set 4 days he goes at the same time, and he will not miss it no matter what. He already works late, so it takes away a lot of our \"free\" time together in the evenings. I know it's important to him, though, which is why I'm okay with it and support him. This evening, we had a huge fight over it and I'm just not sure how to deal with it going forward. Here's a synopsis:\n\nToday was an extremely warm day, and I spent it home alone wishing he were here so we could enjoy it. Soon before he got off of work, I decided it would be fun if we skipped the gym and enjoyed the weather: we could talk, make drinks, BBQ in the backyard, etc. I suggested it to him and before I could finish talking, he walked off. I chased him and finished my request, and he just laughed and went to get ready for the gym. Finally he said if I wanted to stay home, fine, but he was going. He said if I wanted to enjoy the day I needed to tell him long in advance so he could go to the gym at some point during work. I blew up and told him I was sick of him being so rigid about this, and he stormed out (to go to the gym of course!).\n\nSo, am I being unreasonable to ask for some flexibility? Should I just let him do his thing and never interfere, or is his obsession real? Is there any advice anyone can give about how to deal with this: I don't want it to ruin our relationship and yet it seems every major fight we have somehow comes back to this!\nTL;DR:"}

Since then, I have noticed a lack of motivation to actually search for good opportunities. She has applied at roughly 10 different places by simply emailing her resume to the listed contact on various websites, and explaining her career desires. I keep pushing her to network by attending local events in her field, trying to find a mentor, or making a LinkedIn profile--but nothing seems to work. She brushes off my advice by stating that she isn't social enough to network, or that it won't help in her field.\n\n2) We've always talked about not having kids for a good 5-7 years after college so that we can have time to DINK (dual income no kids) and enjoy our lives together as adults. However, looking at the current situation I feel as though I am going to be the only one making a decent income, as most of the jobs she comes across pay only slightly better than minimum wage. I'm not trying to be greedy by any means, I just find success and career drive to be extremely attractive in a life partner.\n\nThese two recent events combined with a solid year of questioning staying with her have left me very confused. I want to motivate her to be more driven and outgoing, but I fear that its not going to happen. I've considered ending it many times before, but as she isn't outgoing I don't think I could leave her with no one for her to fall back on--I can't hurt her that badly...\n\nAny advice?\nTL;DR:"}

We had this conversation at around 1:30 in the afternoon.\n\nI arrived at her house at 6 and knocked on the door, said hi to her parents and made small talk while I waited for her. Funny thing is, when I asked her parents if she was here they thought she was, but when they went to look for her, she wasn't. \n\nThen I get a phone-call from her asking if I can pick her up at her friends house because she is \"too tired\" from their bike ride. Oh and, she wants to know if my car has enough room to fit her bike. \n\nI feel extremely embarrassed in front of her parents and just tell her that I'll be right there. I end up just picking her up, dropping the bike off at her house, and proceed to be ticked off the rest of the night. And no, she didn't shower or change clothes for the dinner, granted it was at my house. \n\nI end up being in a foul mood for most of the night, and it kinda just puts a damper on everything. I did start to open up after dinner though, and we watched a funny movie because I was tired of being pissed at her.\n\nIt still bothers my greatly, and I'm wondering if I should feel this strongly about it, or am I overreacting?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: I was assaulted by another patient while in the hospital after the hospital staff ignored multiple warning signs. Can I sue them for malpractice?\nPOST: This is a long story so I'll try to leave in only the important details. I was recovering from surgery and had to be kept in the hospital because of an elevated heart rate. A man was brought into the room who was obviously very troubled as he was verbally abusing the staff and his 6 visitors. My mother who was with me asked the staff several times to have them quiet down, stop pulling my curtain back, have some visitors leave or move me to a different room. She was brushed off three times at which point one nurse asked four of his guests to leave. When they refused, she gave up and went about her business. Finally, when my mom pleaded with him to be quiet as my heart-rate was continually rising he began to berate and threaten my mother. At this point I began to shout at him. He jumped out of bed and charged at me. I tried to get up and swing at him but was too weak and was unable to stand or make a fist. He then held me down and began punching me in the face and neck, popping some stitches from the surgery in the process. After the police came and took statements they said that they couldn't make any arrests as they weren't a witness to anything. I ended up having to stay the rest of the weak in the hospital in a great deal of pain and was unable to feed myself for a week. This was a month ago. My only remaining issues are heavy scar tissue, facial numbness and partial facial paralysis.\n\nHowever, these were potential side effects of the initial surgery but my doctor did state that the assault seriously impeded the healing process. The current facial issues have a strong possibility of being permanent conditions. \n\nI want to avoid going after the guy who assaulted me as much as possible as I am afraid of him. He has shown himself to be extremely violent and threatened the life of my mother and myself when he was pulled from the room. Also, not to be judgmental, but judging by how he looked and acted he would not have the money to pay the bills.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Problem is not losing weight but keeping it off\nPOST: Hello, 41/m here.\n\nJust wanted to say that I am again wanting to lose some weight.  This would be the fourth time in six or so years that I'm starting.  Fortunately each time I have lost a tremendous amount of weight, at least 40-60 pounds each time.  The last time it happened was last fall.  I don't have a scale where I live but I know a lost a lot of weight because I went from a waist size 36 to 33.  Then I went through a tremendous amount of stress in the spring and am overweight again.  I'm 5'9 and I'm guessing about 240 pounds. My life changes has reflected my weight changes and I am currently at a time where I can exercise regularly and watch my diet etc. \n\nSo my question is to the people who have lost weight and kept it off.  How do you do it?  I do have the discipline to say no to certain foods, to workout when I have to etc yet somehow I cannot make the final commitment to keeping the weight off.  It's very frustrating because I really like the healthy lifestyle of eating right, exercising.  I'm an avid biker, swimmer and sometime gym rat.  I also love reading about different foods and finding out which ones are good for you.  Yet every now and then when I hit a life crisis I lose it.  I get completely depressed and I lose complete interest in myself, my body and my health.  Then I'll turn around and climb that mountain again.  So my question, how do I stay on top?\nTL;DR:"}

In fact, we were on a date, having a really great time, being affectionate, and had even picked up things for our dinner together that night when out of the blue he said he was done.  Suffice to say I was a bit shocked.  He didn't give me a clear reason for what happened, and as far as I can tell he just wasn't feeling it anymore.  \n\nThe hardest thing to swallow about this whole situation is that I still feel like I was the best girlfriend I could have been throughout the relationship.  I was loving, cheerful, I gave him a lot of space and independence, I didn't call/text/need to be with him all the time, I wasn't trying to marry him or move in with him (and made that very clear), I did little nice things for him, etc.  We had so much fun together.  I don't want this to sound boastful, but I also know that I have a lot going for me.

I love him, his family, and I think we are a great match.  \nHowever, things have gotten difficult recently as both of us are still in school and we live about 4 hours apart.  I am in medical school and K is working on his bachelors degree.  \nI'm feeling really frustrated in that I am now at a point in my education where I need to spend a lot of time and focus on it, as well as having a demanding schedule. I am not free as often as I once was when my program was only academic and not mixed with clinical responsibilities.  \nThis means I am not as free to travel as I once was. In addition, my family also lives in the same area as K, so it becomes more difficult to balance seeing everyone when I am able to be home. This can sometimes be a point of contention.   \nK is going to be busy this next year meeting requirements and has told me that he won't be able to come visit as often. Our relationship is already strained from lack of visits. \nI also feel that K puts all the responsibility for communication on me. He never initiates phone calls \"because you have the busier schedule.\" If I didn't call/text we wouldn't talk for days. This is extremely frustrating and exhausting to have to carry the the whole relationship on my shoulders.  \nHe also doesn't want to be friends with my friends from school and will actively ignore them if they try to speak with/engage him in conversation. I know he is introverted, and I don't ask for a ton of socializing from him. This particular instance was at a surprise party for my birthday.  \nI feel like there are more things I could say, but this has already become a rambling wall of text.  Any help in communicating in a LDR would be appreciated. This is my first attempt at one, and I am starting to think that I am bad at them and shouldn't do them. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

It took about 6 months before she was ready to \"open her heart\" and have sex because her last relationship ended badly. And prior to that, she hadn't seen anyone for a year. About 3 months into dating I checked her dating profile because I wanted some of those cute pictures, and saw that she'd been active recently. I gave it about a month but it didn't stop. I confronted her, she cried, said she just liked the attention. I gave her a pass because, well, she was really hot; no better excuse. Long story short, she breaks up with me after a year of dating because she can't handle the big moves my job requires. I respect that and we go our separate ways but still text occasionally. Mostly initiated by her, stuff like \"I'm lonely and want someone to talk to.\" 6 months after our break up, she's engaged! Swears she didn't meet him until after me... but that was fast.\n\nI'm in a relationship with someone else now. Things are great. The problem is that I now have massive trust issues. Not that she's ever given me any reason to mistrust her. I check her phone, find nothing, and feel guilty.

I was really lucky because I found a group of friends that I knew from high school who would all hang out and were happy to have me around. In that group was Jessica and Larry. This is around mid May and at this point they had been dating for a month or two. I had met Jessica once before and found her attractive, but I never acted on it in anyway so she had no idea. \n\nAt this point and currently I consider Larry an acquaintance, as we only hung out in a group and never 1 on 1. Well after the first month of summer, I started to get over my ex a bit more and would hang out with a few other groups of friends as well. As a result, I saw Jessica/Larry's group of friends very little. \n\nTowards the end of the summer there's another get together. Larry's attending summer school for college up north so he isn't there. I find out from Jessica that they had a mutual breakup. She had gone to visit him the week before, but they got into a fight and discussed breaking up before deciding to do so. At this point I'm not looking for a relationship and she's single so I decide to go for it. \n\nMy logic: If she's not comfortable with it I'll back off. I have only known Larry for a few months and I've barely hung out with him. Additionally I met Jessica before they had even dated. If Larry dislikes me for these actions, I totally understand, however I can't refrain from women just because I somewhat know their ex.\n\nWe've since hooked up three times. She attends the same college as Larry, which is a few hours away from me. At this point I'm just looking to reddit to make sure that my actions were not in the wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

However, we found ourselves at a mutual party a few weeks later and ended up kissing. I asked her out again and she said yes. Over the next three months, it was a constant struggle to get her to hang out. She was always constantly busy and putting up barriers. We would see each other 1-2 times a week for a couple hours but it was always such a process. I began to feel like she wasn't as into the relationship as I was so I asked her how she felt about us. She said that she wasn't sure what she wanted, so I took a step back. After that, she pushed forward and began to try to hang out more often. We started to see each other pretty regularly, but she still could not commit to what she wanted out of this relationship. After about 3 months of this, I had finally had it. I told her that our emotional needs were not compatible and that things weren't going to work out.\n\nSkip to now, about a week and a half passes and she wants to talk.

I told him what it was for and he told me that he would have my plates within two weeks. It is now two weeks later and no plates. I am going in tomorrow and going to ask about the plates, but if the past shows anything its that I can expect \"another two weeks\". So currently I am paying for a motorcycle I am not legally able to drive. \n\nIs there any case I can bring against them for not fulfilling their responsibilities, especially because I paid for registration and everything, as well as not being able to use what I am paying them for BECAUSE of their own issues?\n\nA little side info, they were supposed to do a full service on the bike before I picked it up and learned recently that never took place as well. Any advice other than simply \"raising hell\" would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

We have been together for 9 months and I still have not met her and don't even know if she knows I exist. He states she is his best friend which I don't think is true since they do not ever hang out due to living in different cities. He always hides his phone when he is texting her which is not normal if you are only \"friends\". He keeps telling me we are going to go visit our family and hang out with this friend but it seems something always comes up with her and it never happens. \nI need some advice from people that have been in this situation or guys that may know what could be going on here. Is this normal behavior? I am not friends like this with any of my ex's and don't see how this is normal. Thank!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by getting a group of kids to chant \"weed\" at church\nPOST: This happened a few hours ago, this morning.\n\nSo my church has two service times, early and late. I always attend the early service and help out in the 3rd-5th grade Sunday School during late service. I usually just sit by the kids to make sure that they don't talk during the lesson, because a teenager sending a look in their direction during the lesson usually quiets them really quickly.\n\nSo here's where I mess up.\n\nIn the lesson, the adult talking is asking the kids if certain things are \"wants\" or \"needs.\" The usual, clothing, food, an xbox, etc. The kids chant either need or want, and then he moves on to the next one. But, as he starts getting into harder ones, the kids aren't sure, and they go quiet. Being the incredibly smart guy that I am, I lean over to one boy and say \"try combining the words if you don't know, like ne-ant.\" He smiles and starts chanting \"ne-ant,\"\nand the adult, guessing that he's saying the right one, moves on to the next one. But, after one or two, the kids start having trouble pronouncing \"ne-ant,\" and the one that I told to combine them thinks for a second, putting together want and need, and starts to chant \"weed.\" Apparently, the other kids like this version better and start continuously chanting \"weed\" over and over, even when the adult talking hasn't said anything. The other teenagers adults and I in the room desperately try and get them to stop chanting \"weed,\" for fear that a parent might walk in and hear it. The kids think that us trying to get them to stop is funny, and start chanting even louder. Finally, we break them up into small groups, which stops the chanting, but not before a few parents enter and ask what was going on.\n\nSo yeah.\nTL;DR:"}

[UPDATE / subsequent questions]\nPOST: [original post](\n\nSo, we've opted *against* renting a campground. As much as we wanted the ambiance, there was one unforeseen variable that ended up being a deal breaker: all of the campgrounds that we looked at in our area/price range are ABSOLUTELY NO ALCOHOL on the premises, even if we rented the entire grounds. While we're in no mean alcoholics (or even heavy drinkers), we don't want a dry wedding. So that's off the table.\n\nBUT, we're still looking into the idea of renting a private lodge for us and our bridal party (and their +1s probably) for the weekend and holding the ceremony and reception on the grounds with a hotel nearby for the rest of the guests. Obviously there's still a lot of logistics and we have to get permission and insurance and what not...\n\nThe questions we have now are:\n\nSince the bridal party and their +1s would be staying with us instead of at a hotel, can we ask them to pitch in a little toward their accommodations? We'd probably ask somewhere around $50-60 per person (covering 3 nights), which is WAY cheaper than even the cheapest hotel in our area. Virtually everyone in the party is from out of town, so they'd have to be at a hotel if they don't stay with us.\n\nWhat about meals for the weekend? Do we need to pay all of those out of pocket or is it ok for us to ask them to pitch in a little or tell them they're on their own? Rehearsal dinner would be during this time, which we'd definitely cover, and probably brunch the day of the wedding too, but there'd still be probably 3-4 more meals while we're there...\nTL;DR:"}

You see, a few years ago she leant her credit card to her parents for an emergency sum they assured they would be paying back, but haven't, leaving her to deal with a debt that has ballooned over the years on her own. Now, this isn't an impossible amount to pay back, but it is large enough to cause her some anxiety (on top of finding a way to pay for school, etc). Right now, however, she hasn't the means. \n\nHaving to quit her job when they moved across country, nothing seems to be hiring in her new area. We've talked about her moving back here with me in hopes job availability is broader, and she could stay until she's on her feet, but for other reasons she's staying put at least until late summer. Thus begins the quest for alternative sources of income! \n\nRecently, she's come across donating eggs\u2014for stem-cell research, she's not interested in having unknown offspring ambling around. Most sources seem unclear at best, so we turn to you, Reddit. Hopefully you can provide some much needed clarity. \n\nShe'd like to know: \"What are the pros and cons of donating eggs to stem cell? Has anyone on reddit done it, did you get paid, or was it purely *donating?* How old do you have to be?

So I don't know if this is just me being a little paranoid or if I am in the right here. My girlfriend started working at a new job about 5 months ago where she ran into an old male friend who now works with her. At first they just talked a bit, than it turned into a daily visit to each other at the end of the day, than they started texting and facebooking each other. She occasionally would come home with gifts he had given her, nothing big, just small stuff. It got to the point where people where they work thought they were dating. \n\nSo this all made me a little uncomfortable and then about 2 months ago, I was using her phone to text some friends to go out for dinner when I saw he had sent her a text. I opened the texts they had exchanged together (I know I shouldn't have) and in there was info about how they had gone out to lunch together. She had never told me they were going out to lunch or anything. (It was on a day she had off, so it wasn't a work lunch or something of the sort) \n\nThis led up to me being too uncomfortable with it and I brought up the subject, she just kind of wrote it off at first and then after about 5 minutes of discussing it gave me a \"Fine, I just wont hang out with guys anymore\" snappy response. Since I brought it up they went from texting each other daily, to no noticeable communication at all. So now I am wondering if they stopped talking, or moved it to somewhere I don't know about.\n\nSorry if this is written terribly.

The first 4 months were an absolute blast. We out all the time; dinner, gigs, outdoor cinema and she even brought me to a wedding of her friends.   \n\nShe started a masters back in September and it takes up quite a bit more of her time. I'm okay with this and understanding of the work she has to put in. \n\nThere were 2 incidents that I let myself down: \n1) I got quite drunk one night (start of October), she was supposed to come out with my best friend and meet his girlfriend. She cancelled that day to go to a college party. I didn't express myself correctly that this actually annoyed me and had a drunken argument with her.\n\n2) Fast forward a week later and a serious change in communication, I went out with my friends. Again I got drunk over a phone call with her and sounded extremely needy / clingy, trying to apologise for the previous week.\n\nWe talked it all out and agreed we would put it behind us. I have some insecurity and anxiety issues that I am addressing and working through it well. I'm also working on my self control while drunk and no more drunk calls, arguments, texts etc. \n\nNow to get to my point. She's changed entirely with me, not as affectionate, no more nice messages, no more good night messages. \n\nBasically a 180 on how we interacted. I haven't, I'm trying really hard to show her I love her, do things for her but I'm just not getting the same back or even remotely. \n\nI guess I'm asking if you guys think this is worth it any more?

I started seeing my therapist a little less than a year ago for some pretty serious issues. Over time we've gotten a lot closer, and created a pretty good relationship. We both enjoy each other's company, we both care about each other, and my \"friends\" often make me feel like shit, so lately it's felt like she's all I have. She's the only person who really knows me, and the only thing that doesn't make me feel completely alone.\n     For quite a while, I didn't see her in a romantic kind of way, but for the past few months, I've been slowly falling in love with her. I've ignored it thus far, since it hasn't been a huge problem for me, or my time with my therapist. However, it's still been bugging the hell out of me. Last time I was with her, she made a very brief mention of her going on a date-like thing with a guy, and it bothered me quite a bit. Jealously's a bitch. I know unrequited love is not a new concept at all (especially for me), but this situation is a little different, as far as I've seen.\n\nI will read all comments made, and I bet a lot of them will advise me to tell her about these feelings. And just thinking about that makes me cringe at how embarrassing it'll be. I don't know how to talk myself into doing it either. Like I said before, she's all I got, and I can't do something to fuck everything up. I haven't told anyone else in real life about this (hell, they don't even know I'm seeing a therapist), and I wanted to hear some other perspectives on this.

She argues that her fridge is full, because - well - 4 people eating 3 meals a day there. At my place? I got pasta, some bread and that's it. Since we're mostly at her place, I have no need to have food at home since it would go bad in no time. So **(2)** - do know know how to break that vicious cycle?

The brother found me via facebook and tried to befriend me, of which I had no problems. The problem began when we started going out to malls to have fun at the malls however. The brother, let's call him \"Shawn\" drove me and my other friend to the Mall, and he turned on the music really loud in his car which still doesn't really bug me. What bugs me is that he keeps honking to the beat of the song every time the red light goes green of which I think is really rude. He did a few other things in a similar fashion as well, but i'm not gonna comment on that. Another thing that bugged me was that he would always message me around 4am in the morning with pictures of airsoft gun deals and asked me if it was a good deal or not. Me not knowing so much about guns, I said I don't know every time he sent me a message of the sort. He also had a way of knowing information that I didn't even talk among my regular set of friends. Fast forward to a few weeks, I went and hung out with Fred. So I talked to Fred about his brother, and I said that he did things annoy me, and I did call him annoying but he was a really nice guy. Now, I found out that Fred stopped hanging out with me due to fact that he said I was \"complaining\" about his brother and that he was the one that told all of the information to his brother Shawn. I don't think I was complaining though, I thought of Fred as a really close fried so I thought I could share my thoughts and emotions with him but I guess I was wrong. Now Fred put up a facebook post saying that he's sick of people indirectly telling him how bad or annoying the other party is.

He still seems to WANT sex a lot...even when it's clear it isn't going to work (because he's not hard enough) he insists on *trying* which is just so awkward and not pleasurable for either of us.

I'm looking forward to being together with him again, but I am worried about one aspect: for about the past two months, I have been under a lot of stress for a variety of reasons, and have fallen back into my old self harm habits. It's something I have done with varying degrees of frequency since I was a pre-teen, including while my boyfriend and I were together in the same city. However, it's always been pretty easy to lie about where the scars/cuts are coming from, as minor injuries are common in my line of work and I tend to be clumsy anyways. \n\nUnfortunately, over the last couple of months I've been doing it a LOT more, and causing wounds that are deep enough to leave more noticeable permanent scars. I'm worried that my boyfriend will recognize what that are from.\n\nSo I'm having trouble deciding what to do. I could tell him flat out what's been going on. He's a wonderful guy, and I'm sure he would try to support me and be understanding. But I worry about it changing our relationship. We've always been equals, not the supporter and the one who needs support. I think he would worry, and he might see me as someone weak, or damaged. Alternatively, I could keep going with my usual approach and lie about them. He's pretty used to seeing me marked up; maybe it would side under the radar. I've never gone into the things that are stressing me out with him, or given him other reason to think I would do this. But if I don't tell him, and he guesses, then he might be upset about the lies. He might be sad that I don't trust him. \n\nWe'll be back together in a few months. Any thoughts on what the better approach to take is would be appreciated. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

I had to resort to this option because I had multiple other things planned that day and had to get home. After I cut the lock, i threw it in my bag and hoped on my bike to go home. Im almost home and this car pulls up net to me as im riding and a guy shouts out the window; \"I SAW YOU STEAL THAT BIKE, IM CALLING THE COPS\" and im like \"whatever dude\" and keep pedaling. I mean, its MY bike, it shouldnt be a problem. Anyways, I super close to home and a cop pulls me over to the sidewalk and asks me about the bike and told me that he got a call saying that I \"stole\" it.  I try to explain to him that its mine, but since I had no proof, he took it away and I had to walk the rest of the way home... Now I have to go into the police station tomorrow to BUY it back from them. I have to Friggin BUY it from them like wtf.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know if I should believe this text or not, but it has definitely made me uneasy. Anyways I was just sleeping over at my girlfriends house (currently 12:08am) and she was sleeping and I got a text. It was an anonymous text saying \"Sorry bro your girlfriend cheated on you\".\n\nMy first reaction is 'What the fuck, who is this and whats going on?' I \ndon't really know what to think or what to do. I woke up my girlfriend and asked her to drive me home. I'm kind of in shock because I don't know if I should believe this or not, but it sort of does add up. With other factors that kind of makes sense and fits together like a truth. \n\nWhat should I do? How do I confront her if I even should? Should I ask her to show me her texts or something or should I just ask her and believe her? I don't know. I am supposed to go out to her sisters birthday party with her tomorrow.\n\nWe have great times together and I love her and who knows if I could work past this or not. She makes me smile all the time when I'm around her and we giggle and have fun all the time. I really need to know how to deal with this and what to do.

I can't work, I had to quit my last job as this garbage just kept getting worse. \n\nObviously, this is messing with me, I'm extremely lonely, even just for friends, I only have a few, and I don't see them often, but I CRAVE human touch.

They had the mandatory 1 year separation (which they frequently broke) in order to be divorced in our state and signed the papers about a month or so before our wedding. They were married for about 25 years.\n\nEver since then, they will frequently \"get back together\" because they both miss each other. I speculate that it's because they can't find \"the one\" again. She has a brother (in the Marines, doesn't seem to care) and a sister, who only seems to care because father buys her stuff.\n\nMy wife is absolutely furious at both of them. Her mother emotionally dumps on her all the time. She knows about every single fight and argument that her parents have had. I know for a fact that her mother has dated at least 8 men since the divorce, slept with a few of those. We're not exactly sure how her sister is handling it emotionally, since she's materialistically getting a sweet deal. \n\nWhat can my wife do?

She will send multiple messages in a row without waiting for a reply, so sometimes I'll get off a shift and see several messages from her. She often asks me how my day was, tells me I'm special to her, that she's glad she met me and that she feels lucky to have me in her life. When I don't reply, she looks at me at work, and sometimes asks me if I'm stressed or haven't had time to check my phone lately. Other times, she'll post public statuses that say something like \"So glad to have met my new good friend Mike, you rock.\"\n\nI just don't know how to handle the situation without making her feel really bad.

In fact, he can't understand why anyone would listen to anything other than this specific kind of music.  When I try to point out that people have different interests and tastes, he'll often remark that their opinion about music is wrong.  Later, he'll say he was joking, like, \"Of course I know people can have different opinions.\"  But this recurring behavior makes me really question if he actually does believe that.\n\nHe's also a musician and very proud of his playing.  I know that music and playing are very important to him, and I enjoy that he is a very well-rounded person.  However, lately it's been bothering me when he asks to play around me, because I feel like he may be getting some sort of satisfaction from it, kind of like, \"Look at me, I'm amazingly talented at this instrument.\"  When I confronted him about it, he says that's not at all how he feels.

He is also weirdly competitive, and whenever we play games together as a family, he gets very upset when he loses. On top of it all, he is barely passing any of his classes in school, and may be returned to his home country because of it. My mom is a nurse, who often works with students who have special needs, and she believes that he has Asperger's and just hasn't been diagnosed. \n\nI know my family should have taken this into account when getting an exchange student, but he really needed a place to stay, and was quite desperate. He's an only child at home, with a stay at home mom, so he's probably used to a bit more attention. However, he doesn't meld very well at all with our family. They haven't said anything about any problems to me, but it's very, very apparent that his presence is very taxing for them. \n\nFor now, while I'm on break, I will do my best to occupy him, and make sure that my family can have a little reprieve.

There needs to be some sort of long term fix, though, where my family doesn't go crazy, and he doesn't get his feelings hurt by getting kicked out of another host family. \n\nThanks for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

What should I do?\nPOST: Hello, I'm about to graduate college with my B.A. in psychology by the end of this year. I've decided that I would like to be an academic adviser. It is rare for people with a B.A. and little experience to get the job right off the bat. So I'm applying to other positions from Universities so I can get my foot in the door and get experience.\n\nI applied to a part-time position from the University that I want to work for the most. Thing is it has been about a month since I've submitted my application, my application stats still says \"in Process\" and the position is still on the website.. I actually e-mailed the Employer Manager from HR asking about my resume and if it has been rejected, what was I missing and who is the hiring manager for this job. Unfortunately I got back a generic e-mail saying \"thank you for applying.. blah, blah\" didn't answer any of my questions.\n\nThis shows that I need to call this person or meet in person, thing is I have no idea what to say about this matter.  So how should I bring this up that won't be viewed in a negative light? I think I'm right for the position since I've been working at my universities patent office for almost 2 years and I thought I was a good fit.\nTL;DR:"}

How can I take it to the next level?\nPOST: Today in class a girl spoke out from the back of the room during a psychology discussion about fear of rejection. I noted that I agreed with her point of view, and thought nothing more of it.\n\nAfter class, I'm in line to speak to the professor. She happens to be ahead of me. We both felt an energy and she turned around and said hello to me. I greeted her and told her that she made some really good points in the discussion. She was open enough with me to mention that she sometimes has a fear of rejection which is why she brought the topic up.\n\nI told her that it's natural to have a fear of rejection, and that she didn't seem afraid when she spoke up from the back of the class. I think she liked that comment because she smiled. We continued to talk for a couple of minutes. We had a few silences during the conversation in line, but it didn't feel uncomfortable at any point.\n\nHow can I naturally transition this into something more? How do I know if she likes me in more than a friendly way? I see the irony that the class topic was fear of rejection.\n\nAnyway, suggestions appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

We dated for a very short time, broke up, and just became friends. While we were friends, she, and our mutual friends, said some pretty nasty things behind my back and started a witch hunt against me just because my ex all of a sudden decided that she didn't want to be my friend anymore.\n\nSo, naturally, I left that group of friends to rid myself of the emotional burden. After I left, my ex got a new boyfriend. This disturbed me a little bit, but I mostly got over it and I never engaged in any petty rumor spreading or anything, the stuff that they did to me. Although I still have some good friends in that group, I had to completely cut myself off, because I am a kind of emotionally volatile person.\n\nThe reason I am posting today is to ask how I can just not give a fuck about her anymore. Today, I noticed that she had unfollowed/blocked/unfriended me on all forms of social media. This might not seem like a big deal, and it definitely isn't, but it made me so angry. I don't know why. I was so angry that I'm glad I didn't see her because I probably would have punched her in the face. Now, I feel very sad and alone.\n\nI realize that these feelings are very unhealthy, and I feel like I should reach out and ask for advice on how to deal with this.\n\nAny and all contributions are welcome, thank you all very much for reading this.\nTL;DR:"}

She goes 'kinda hard to explain on tinder' and since I've recently heard of the motto 'fake it till you make it' take it as a clue to invite her for a coffee at Starbucks in town. She says yes. We're supposed to meet early afternoon for a learning break. We 'texted' again yesterday via tinder (Tuesday, this time my job came up) and she said I should tell her in more detail when we meet. (Thursday) \n\nMy problem is, in my whole life I've never been on a date or in a romantic situation. After a brief moment of excitement I've been anxious and in a constant state of panik since Monday. I have plenty of female friends but that's it. It's never been date-like,i don't know why, it just never occurred. I don't have the slightest idea on what this meeting will be like. How do I greet her? Will I be super excited and sweaty, if so, what am I gonna do then? Do I pay for her coffee? Am I supposed to schedule another meeting with her afterwards? I guess I just wear everyday clothing? How awkward is it gonna or how can I keep it from happening? Maybe I should not go. But I feel like it's time to get a girlfriend soon, or at least start dating. Help me, please!\nTL;DR:"}

Even more than a year later I'd do anything to get her to come back, but looking back, we were *too* involved with each other.\n\nThe only other girlfriend I've had, my \"current\" one, is one of the clingy obsessive types that won't let me have even a moment alone outside of when I'm in class or at work.  \n\nI've tried to get out of it twice now in the last month, but she can't seem to understand that I want out for good; she seems to think it's a temporary thing and guilts me into coming back within 24 hours.\n\nI don't particularly consider myself that attractive, being slightly overweight, and I have a somewhat noticeable birth defect; tried cosmetically fixing it, caused more harm than good.  To make matters worse, I'm that stereotypical nice guy - the one everyone ignores because I just sit quietly minding my own business and not being a complete jackass. When I try to talk to ladies, I just get instantly friendzoned, if they even notice me trying to talk to them in the first place.\n\nAs a result, I have no social confidence whatsoever, and since I choose not to drink, that isn't an option for me either. I know deep down that there has to be someone of the opposite sex around my age (19) that is like me, but I can't seem to find her.\n\nCome to think of it, I'd probably miss her anyway due to lack of confidence :(\nTL;DR:"}

Even though I stopped going, he and I hung out once in a while.\n\nWe didn't see each other for several months in 2012 because of conflicting schedules.  I messaged him in December and when we saw each other again, I felt this awesome chemistry between us.  We saw each other very regularly in December (once a week).  He came to a party my friends and I had.  I got very drunk, kissed him on the cheek at the end of the night but nothing else happened.\n\nI saw him again shortly after New Year's.  We hung out, had a great time and I kissed him on the cheek at the end of THAT night.  Again, nothing else  happened.

He said he didn't want to try to progress our relationship because he was concerned about our age difference.\n\nWe made plans to meet in person to talk about it.  We did this past weekend.  He said he respects me and does care about me but he cannot get over our age difference.  He said it has nothing to do with me but he just can't get past the fact that we are 7 years apart in age.  I said I understand and don't want to force him into anything and we should just remain friends.  He agreed to this.\n\nThat is basically it.  I have not contacted him all weekend because I am still sorting out my own feelings about this.  I am disappointed and also a little angry at him, surprisingly.  I don't blame him for anything but I suppose I am mad because he doesn't even want to try and give this a shot.  I wondered if the age difference is just an excuse and that perhaps he is just very afraid of the idea of having a relationship beyond friendship with me.

I asked around my older friends and managed to get him a set of LSAT prep books and account details for a well-reviewed online prep course. I also researched some fellowships that would provide financial support for his internship. So far he hasn't really followed up on any of these, although he did tell me that the books looked good.

So she felt like she diden't have time for a boyfriend right now.\n\nWell in april 2015 I almost broke up with her beacuse I diden't know how I felt and had alot going on with school. but I decided that maybe I just needed a break so we spent 4 weeks apart, untill I texted her and said I missed her and we began to hang out again and I feel in love with her again and everything was great.\n\nSo to me it seems kinda like it might be the same this time, that she just needs time beacuse she got alot going on right now. And when I have asked her about it, if she thinks there is a chance of us getting back together she says that she doesen't know and just need time for herself right now. She said she will tell me when she wants to meet and talk.\n\nTo me it won't really feel like it's over untill I get to meet her and talk again and see if maybe she do want to give it another chance and see what happens. Maybe it's beacuse it's only been 1 month and that It happend so suddenly, but I haven't really accepted that it is really over. and well she haven't hinted that it is either possible or impossible. She says she doesent know and don't want to get my hopes up incase that isn't what she feel when we do meet and talk.\n\nMaybe someone has some advice to me or has been in a similar situation. Well I would be thankful for anything really beacuse this really sucks and I'm scared. But I'm trying to be optimistic beacuse it seems like anything can happen when we do meet.\nTL;DR:"}

At that time, I was going to a private school and my mom, as usual, was driving my sister and I to school in the morning before work. We were at a crowded intersection and we were turning left (the traffic light was late yellow) when all of a sudden this huge black GMC truck slams into our Volvo going at like 80km/h (50mph) in a 60km/h zone. I would assume the driver sped up to make the light, but anyways, I was sitting in the backseat and my sister was sitting in shotgun. I saw the truck coming at me and I seriously swear everything was at a standstill...I closed my eyes and I shut them and braced for impact. Worst feeling ever, got shaken around and slammed my head against the window and but it didn't crack. I opened my eyes and my mom was bleeding from her head and she kept asking my sister and I if we were okay. It turned out in those last few seconds before impact, my mom managed to turn the car a bit thus, avoiding my sister and I getting directly hit (as we were sitting on the right side of the car). My mom got a spinal & neck injury (her face was a bit scarred, but it's almost unnoticeable now), but she can't walk or stand for long periods and she always avoids making left turns and that particular intersection. It turned out I was quite well and got away with only a bruise from the seat belt. My sister had to stay in the hospital along with my mom for a while, whereas my mom forced me to go to school and I only missed first period of class. Oh, and this intersection was right in front of a major hospital. Mothers.\nTL;DR:"}

There have been so many issues during our lives, it would be impossible to try to describe in a single post all of the co-dependency, verbal abuse and control issues that they deal with, in ways that have \"seem\" normal after so long.  They are old-school hispanic folk who think therapy is only for people with severe mental issues and they NEVER resolve their problems EVER.  They just do their version of \"moving on\".  \nIt seems that as of late, their issues have been escalating to the point that there have been some nasty back and forth comments publicly on facebook, which is now involving other family members taking sides and airing dirty, OLD laundry.  It's seriously pathetic.  \nMy stance is this: If they are happier, healthier people by separating, yes, it would hurt me, but in the end, I am supportive of that idea.  \nThe problem is: I have some family members trying to pull me in the direction of only supporting my mother, while making my dad seem like this awful monster.  The man is not without fault.  He's said some things in the last couple of days that do not make me proud of him, and it has been hurtful.  However, he's been a great dad to me and I won't abandon him during this difficult time.  I refuse to take sides.

I have to really press her to get her to tell me her opinions on things, people, the world. I feel like if I didn't instigate a lot of conversations they'd never happen. Her text messages are devoid of emotion and kind of robotic like.\n\nFor example, I'll write a really long paragraph on how I wish she expressed her thoughts with me more and she'll respond \"Aw I'm sorry babe.\" I can't tell you how many times I've heard that.\n\nI'm kind of getting the feeling this is going to be a dealbreaker.

Beyond a few occasional arguments in the past, we have a great relationship. We have similar interests and goals, and are like-minded socially. We generally agree on pretty much everything. Over the past year we have dealt with more serious issues beyond that of normal college stress.

Overall, it's safe to say that I am content and feel confident in our future based on our past.\n\nI've met his parents a few times and while we are not close his mom seems to like me. He is a mama's boy to the nth power. Now apparently while at home for Christmas they had an interesting conversation. She commented that a relationship of over a year in college much be pretty serious. He agreed. She then asked if he had any ideas about our intentions or future together. \n\nHe said, and I quote, \"I enjoy spending time with her, but I don't think we have a future.

Of course though, it's soured her a bit.\n\nAdditionally, and I think this is the biggest thing, I've never owned a home, only rented apartments, and her one experience with owning a home was one where basically she did *everything* and could rely on one else for anything. I'm a **huge** helper, and she knows that, but I've never owned before. To add to that, I'm a SUPER laid back guy. I'm not lazy by any means, but during these past few months, she's been stressing a lot more than I have about the whole house thing. I think she's concerned because I never seem worried about it (We're both hard workers, and we're in love, so we're in as good a position to own a home as anyone's ever been) and she does tend to worry about (she's a worrier, had a bad experience, and my not worrying worries her more.)\n\nWhat can I do to help her be more comfortable with what's going on? I don't want her worrying that I'm not taking it seriously, or that I won't be there to take care of things routinely, etc. I know I've never had a house and I don't technically know what I'm in for, but I am also very prepared to be doing a boat-load of work, and I want to help her accept that.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [24 F] dating [29 M] for 2 months, how do I tell him that I'm not orgasming when we have sex? Is he selfish in bed or just clueless?\nPOST: As the title states, we've been together for 2 months and sleeping together for maybe a month. I'm not as sexually experienced as he is, I had only had sex a total of 3 times (not number of partners) before I met him so this is all pretty new to me. He has had multiple long term relationships.\n\nHe has a medical condition which can sometimes make getting and staying hard difficult so I have made an effort to help him out. Usually sex starts with me giving him a blowjob. It's not my favorite thing to do but it makes him feel good and gets things going so I'm down. However, he has never gone down on me. Sex ends when he has an orgasm. I'll ask if he came but he's only asked me once if I did. I did make a mistake!! I was caught off guard when he asked this and I just said \"yes\" - it was like word vomit. So I own up to that and I know I should've been honest. But since then he hasn't asked again. I don't know if he assumes I'm having an orgasm? Or if he's just selfish?\n\nAs I mentioned above I'm not very sexually experienced. So I'm not sure how to bring this up or what to say. I've never orgasmed during sex (even before this guy) so it's not like I have a road map of how I can come during sex. I've tried to reach down and touch myself during sex to get things going but it feels very awkward and kind of gets in the way. \n\nI know I can't keep going on like this. I'm starting to get resentful that he orgasms and I don't. Once (because of his medical condition) he couldnt orgasm even after we'd had sex for awhile. So he just kind of said \"it's not gonna happen\" and we stopped. In my head I was just thinking...okay you didn't orgasm but I still can?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been seeing someone, who is younger than me, for a couple months now. He's a great guy and we have a great time together.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if our emotional maturity isn't matching up. Yes, I know there's the age difference, but I've had deep, meaningful friendships with younger guys before. (Note:this is the FIRST time I've dated or had any sort of intimate relations with a younger guy) I'm a very open and honest person. I love having deep, intellectual conversations. I love asking questions and getting to know a person. I'm a pretty romantic person too. I'm also a completely silly person, but I do like to emotionally connect more than anything.\n\nWhenever I try opening up to this guy though or when I ask him questions like \"What scares you the most\" or even when I give him advice (on a mature and deep level), he always makes a joke. I realize this is a defense mechanism, but we've been seeing each other for about 4 months now. I casually brought this topic up with him once and his reply was \"What do you want to talk about? Conflict in North Korea? I'm a dumb man. That's just who I am.\"\n\nI don't think he gets it. I think he might still be scared to be vulnerable and I say this because a) He still hasn't officially stated he wants to date me and only me b) He jokes when things get serious and c) His last girlfriend was a bonafide nut job that screwed with him big time.\n\nJust not sure how much longer to give this. I enjoy his company, but he's not ready to commit in any way, nor is he comfortable opening up. I've never had this issue with another person before... so I'm not sure what's up.\nTL;DR:"}

When it finally happened, it was great, and we all had fun and laughed,  but the next day I couldn't get the image of him and this other girl doing something he and I so lovingly did in private. \n\nSince then, he has been the one initiating things, finding girls online and showing me their pictures that they emailed him for my approval. I know he thinks he's finding something fun that we both like, but it's tearing me up inside that he's looking without me even knowing until they've exchanged emails. \n\nHe's about to pick up another job because he wants us to go on vacation and get our own place. He says this is why he was most recently looking, because he \"figured his social life is ending pretty soon.\" He did apologize for sounding like he was guilt tripping me.\n\nIn short, now I can't stop feeling like I alone am not good enough for him. I feel guilty for feeling jealous because he's always done so much for me and told me how he only wants to be with me and that he's not going to leave me. I just torn up inside and sick.

I ended up losing my job in December 2014, and took an early withdrawal from my IRA in February 2015 to purchase a vehicle since my new job was much further away. The thought I had when I sold off shares in my IRA was that I could keep the amount I would pay in tax in the IRA, and withdraw it later to pay the tax bill, but allow me to keep investing for the duration of the year. I also had a lot of about $3-4K in medical bills that were paid over the course of the year.\n\nWe are weighing using a CPA vs. going to Jackson Hewitt like we did last year, and have been leaning toward using a CPA. The only issue with that is the guy I would use is booked until 4/15, so now I am looking at filing an extension.\nTL;DR:"}

Few days ago Jenny asked me about things related to the break-up and I think she is suspecting what Jim did.

Long story short, I was involved in an automobile-bicycle accident a while back. The other parties' insurance company admitted full fault and paid for all medical bills and repairs. They then offered me 10k for damages associated with the medical injuries I incurred. I was initially taken back by this offer, since I have no legal counsel and thought it seemed very high. This was 1-2 months back and I have not accepted because of increasing discomfort in my leg which was broken in the accident. After visiting the doctor he said everything is fine, but that it may continue to bother me indefinitely. Because of this potential long term discomfort and rather severe scarring, I am considering asking for more in my settlement. What are the dangers associated in doing this, and, how would I go about this. Thanks for any input, I am rather clueless about these sorts of things.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm beginning to think I may be wrong about that. \n\nMy boyfriend is bisexual and has always been very open with me about it. We have talked about what he needs and wants in the bedroom and how we can make this work. We have discussed the idea of a threesome and both decided that if one of us is going to be with anyone else in a sexual manner that we would do it together.  He has always told me that he rarely has the urge to be with a man and that he would tell me beforehand. \n  He has been working out of town and I found an ad on Craigslist that he was looking for a guy for a regular hookup when he is out of town. When I read the ad my heart sank and I feel like he has lied to me. I'm having a hard time understanding why he wouldn't tell me when he knows that I would understand. I never thought he would cheat because we are very open and honest with each other. We have both been cheated on by others and have always agreed that we would never hurt each other like we were hurt.\n\nSo my question to you is how do I confront him about this ad and possibly cheating and how do I deal with it if he has already cheated.\nTL;DR:"}

Since then, we've been sharing a room in a one bedroom apartment, and things were going fine. Then, two nights ago, we got high and ended up hooking up. At the end, we were both tired and knew it was best not to have a conversation about it while high, so we went to sleep.\n\nThe next night, we both avoided talking about it, watched a movie, and started cuddling. After a few hours, we ended up in her bed naked, this time completely sober. We talked some about it, and neither of us have romantic feelings for the other. Neither of is has even been attracted to each other before this. She told me that she might not be entirely comfortable with it, which I told her was enough of a reason to back off entirely, and that we would finish the conversation tomorrow. We have not yet had the chance to do that.\n\nNow, knowing that she is unsure about how she feels, I don't want to pursue anything further. If she does a 180 though and is suddenly up for it, I don't know how to react. Obviously, logically, I know it is a bad idea. But that hasn't stopped it from happening twice already. I guess I want advice as to whether a roommates-with-benefits type of situation can possibly work. My mind says no, but if that's the case then I need further convincing of what a bad idea it is.

We were able to pay cash so no car payments, which is awesome.  \n\nHOWEVER, now we have to get rid of our current ride.  This German-engineered dinosaur is becoming a money hole.  It takes premium gas and pricey parts, and we still owe about $2600 to the bank.  We need to ditch it before we're making a bunch of insurance payments on two cars.  \n\nThe good news is, we found someone on Craigslist who is interested in the car!  We listed it for the $2600, and they told me they wanted it ASAP... Then they asked if we would accept monthly payments from them.\n\nSince I'm thinking \"Nope. No way,\" I got in touch with our bank to see if the loan could be transferred.  The bank said the only way they would do a transfer is if the buyer took out a loan (at any bank) and gave us a cashier's check to send to our bank.  Then, the title would be transferred to the buyer's bank and we would be off the hook.\n\nBuyer says \"That would be a little hard as I do not bank but have a really great paying job down in ******** I could pay more per month.\"  So basically they want a loan from us, which is super risky and a bad idea.\n\nAfter all that explanation, here's my query: Is there any way we can make this work without putting ourselves totally at risk?  So far, we have had zero interest in this car other than this one buyer.  We NEED to get rid of this car.  Unfortunately we cannot afford to just pay off the rest of the loan right now since we just bought another car in cash.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been to therapy and done self-help, so I know why I'm like this...I just have problems with the practical aspects of living life.\n\nI've had a crush on my co-worker ever since I started my job two years ago and it's just now starting to really wear me down and I'm getting depressed (I'm married [19 yrs together] and my husband [36 M] knows about my crush). In the past, putting distance between me and the person has helped, but this is the first time I've had this issue with a someone I work closely with.\n\nI currently sit next to him and already found a way to move to another area in the office. Unfortunately, after I got the move approved, I ended up having to tell my boss that I didn't want to sit next to this person (because the boss was talking about moving everyone around and I was afraid I'd end up next to him again). Luckily, the boss didn't push me on the issue, even though I was clearly emotional when I requested not to be next to this person.\n\nOne of my main issues is that I go on Facebook and look at his profile, which is unhealthy. I would like to unfriend him, but I can't see how I could possibly do that without him noticing. I thought maybe I could unfriend all my co-workers and come up with some excuse about minimizing my Facebook activity. Maybe I have to quite Facebook all together.\n\nAt meetings I just try to stay away from him and out of his line of sight. Another big problem is that we sometimes have to sit in front of the computer together to work through problems.\n\nI'm looking for tips to create distance without causing drama. We are a small, friendly, casual group of co-workers. Or do I need to address this in an honest way? I'm starting to look for other jobs, but I'm in a very specialized field.\nTL;DR:"}

Things started off great - we met at a party where we realized that we had a ton of mutual friends, I was very attracted to him and when I told him I was bi, he was all over me and asked me out. For the first week I was completely enthralled by him. He's smart, social, funny, masculine, wears suits all the time and instantly clicked with my friends. \n\nFor literally no reason, this past week I've totally lost interest in him. He hasn't changed a bit, and yet suddenly I don't even want to see him. As he seems to fall deeper for me, I've just become generally annoyed by him. I've kept going out with him in hopes that this feeling, or lack thereof, passes. \n\nThis has happened every other time I've dated someone, but I've usually blamed my feelings on nitpicks about my partners. But now that it's happening again with someone so seemingly perfect, I think it's pretty clear that I'm the problem. I'm personally afraid that I have some sort of personality disorder, and I think I could use some therapy. Cause I really don't want to be this guy. I want to be able to be satisfied by a relationship.\n\nThoughts? Should I just try to ride this feeling out? Should I tell him that I feel nothing for him, but that's not how I want it to be?\n\nI just want some kind of grasp on my emotions, and any advice is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Last week, out of nowhere, she asked if I wanted to take a break. I really didn't understand why since we are on very good terms, but her reasoning is that she wants to spend the rest of her life with me (the feeling is mutual) and we have been each other's first significant others so we will never know what it is like to be single.

That was red flag number one that I was more into it than he was. So after 5 months he broke up with me and then I found out he told his ex that he never cared about me and wanted her back. So that fucking hurt.\n\nAnyway after a while of fighting we decided to move past it and be friends again, but friends led to friends with benefits which was NOT what I wanted. I told him we would either be a couple or strictly friends, and he chose friends.\n\nIt's been a long time since then and I have a boyfriend now. My ex and I have stayed close even though college keeps us physically far apart. These past few days, however, we've been home from college and he's been flirting with me. He'll only be here until Sunday. I know I want him but in a different way than he wants me. I idealize him and tend to push all the memories of times he hurt me under the rug. \n\nI know I do this to myself but I want him more than anything. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend but I think these feelings about my ex make me unfaithful anyway. I don't know what to do and he's leaving so soon.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by ignoring frequent muscle cramps.\nPOST: Hi everyone I'm a long time lurker, first time poster so hopefully I've done this right. This actually happened a couple months ago but still a pretty big fuck up for me. I've always been a very active guy, I loved playing football as a kid and now in my lates teens I've started to play rugby. Ive always been slight pigeon toed meaning my feet turn in. Well for about the past five years when I'll be playing football or rugby, I would start to get back cramps in my calfs while running. It started off as just one everyone once in a while but soon reached a point of at least one a game, much to the concern of mother. Now here's the fuck up, I would always ignore it and continue to play and it would continue to get worse and worse. Now while playing a rugby match just this past September, my calfs had taken enough and they gave out on me. I couldn't stand for what felt like an hour and had to get carried off the field. Within a day I could walk again, but I couldn't run. Turn out because of the slight inward turn on my feet, it caused my calfs to have to do extra to work to support all my weight (200lbs). The cramps were from the strain at one point being too much for my calfs to handle so they would cramp up. Ignoring them allowed for it get worse and worse, to the point where I almost needed surgery. I'm now a few months into my message therapy and physical therapy, and still got a few more to go, so yeah, a pretty decent fuck up on my part.\nTL;DR:"}

After months of hard work, today was the day we found out if we made one of our 3 high school baseball teams. With 53 kids, my coach had to cut some players in order to not have too many players on the teams. Being a freshman, I didn't expect to make Varsity or JV, but was hoping for a spot on level 3. Level 3 try-outs were after school, but Varsity and JV were posted in the locker rooms. I was looking at them with a few buddies, when a good friend of mine, who is a senior, came into see the teams. Me being my stupid self say \"Sorry Kip, you got cut.\" I hadn't realized at the time that he actually was cut. Later that day, I ended up getting cut. Merely to make myself feel better, I tell myself that it's because I'm 5ft 6in and left handed who doesn't pitch (all you baseball players out there know there that I can only play outfield because I'm not big enough for first base and can't play infield as a lefty), but really I think karma caught up to me.

I am not that bad (average looking) but I rarely meet new girls for various reasons I don't need to explain here. Also I am only interested in having an actual relationship, not one-night stands etc.  \nMore importantly, I rarely like someone enough to approach her romantically as I find most women dull or naive. Hence, I tend to appreciate women with a good taste, odd interests who are into science or geeky culture because I really want to feel that I can have a conversation with my SO about things we like and spend time together.  \nShe is a nice girl and there is a chance she likes me or at least finds me likeable. Due to the fact that she is just as inexperienced as I am I have trouble understanding whether that's true or not. I know for a fact that she never really makes a move towards guys.  \nHowever, I am just not sure if I like her enough myself. I know that I am not as interested in her as I was towards previous cases.  \nTruth is though that it gets lonely at times for me and she does have the potential to be nice and interesting to an extent for me.\n\nSo...

I guess its best shown in examples: So she is a natural person, she basically never uses makeup, which I'm totally fine with. Once I told her that maybe she could try it, because I like experimenting. Now I guess she was bad at it, which is kinda obvious since she has no experience. But I wasn't able to tell her that it was not so great and how I would like it better, because I know that she stepped out of her comfort zone doing that and she did that for me.

I am a nerdy database administrator, foreveralone kind of guy. Never had any relationships longer than several dates. About two years ago she messaged me on my okcupid profile. Yes, that's right, she messaged me. To be fair, Okcupid in my country don't usually used by people who don't know English, so there are not so many people on it, proverbial Chads are not usually bothered to learn a second language. It is day and night compared to dating sites in my native language, where I usually don't even get replies to 99 out of 100 messages I send.\n\nSo she messaged me, we talk and even meet several times. First time was really great, I remember thinking to myself \"That's the kind of girl I want to be with\". And she looked interested at first too. We met several times after it, but she looked less enthusiastic and it took me a lot of time to convince her to go out with me. Last time I tried to act confident and lightly kissed her on lips and said that I want to have relationships with her. She said that she need to think about it and that she still likes the guy who dumped her a year ago and hope to fix things with him. Well, that was polite rejection. After that she never agreed to meet me or agreed and then cancelled plans. But we continue to talk. I have a feeling that it may be unhealthy, but I like to message with her.\nTL;DR:"}

He would say things like \"Eat up, the baby needs to grow\" and \"Oh, you're nauseous? Must be the morning sickness!\", which made me a bit uncomfortable, but I laughed it off thinking he just had a sick sense of humor.. or thought I was fat.\n\nAnd then after a night of heavy drinking, it happened, we were intimate, and the condom was leaky. (How convenient)\n\nOnce I had realised what had happened, I freaked out a bit, and when he went into the restroom I grabbed the rest of the condoms to inspec them; Lo and behold upon further inspection, I found tiny little needle marks in the packaging and KNEW he had put them there.

I'm, needless to say, devastated, but I try to piece my life back together.\n\nA few weeks go by and the roommate of one of my groomsmen calls me because he \"needs to get something of his chest.\"  He's known for a while that my ex-fiance and one of my best friends had been sleeping together for a while and couldn't carry the secret anymore.\n\nI haven't spoken to either of them since this incident but it's been well over a year since everything happened and what I'm asking my fellow redditors is how does one get back out there when they have such crippling trust issues?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [25m] think my girlfriend [21f] is abusive and I'm not quite sure how I should react about it.\nPOST: We've been dating for a little over a year. I met her when I was in college and we became good friends before we started dating though.\n\nShe's very insecure. I don't \"set boundaries\" in our relationship. She can do whatever she wants and so can I, but we both know what we should and shouldn't do. I don't flirt with other girls, for example. I do ocasionally look at pretty people in general, men or women, because I'm not blind and relationships aren't supposed to be a cage, but I don't do anything that I know will hurt her.\n\nShe gets jealous really easily. One time we were at a store and there was this awfully attractive woman, so I looked at her when she walked in front of us and I thought 'well, she's hot'. Then I moved on with my life because I love my girlfriend.\n\nMy girlfriend saw it and got crazy. She was moody all the way over to our house and when we got home, she broke everything in my room. Absolutely fucking everything. Then she started crying and said 'see, you made me do it! why are you such an awful person?' and I was pissed off. She reverted the situation and cried more, saying she was going to kill herself because she always fucks things up. I actually had to take the pills out of her hand.\n\nIt wasn't the first time. Whenever I'm going to leave if we're having a fight, she blocks the way. She locks the door. She says she's going to kill herself if I leave, that she can't live without me. She practices self-harm after we argue. If she doesn't get what she wants, she cries.\n\nAt first I was feeling sorry for her, I thought if I loved her enough she would change. I tried to take her to therapy. Nothing ever makes her change. I'm done but at the same time I'm afraid she's going to do something bad to herself. Any advice is appreciated, to be honest.\nTL;DR:"}

I understand why she sent it and what she's trying to get across but; Currently we are living on a rather strict budget where I'm swapping career paths and have only just been recently employed and she has only just received her first paycheck from her new job.\n\nThe thing is, I know that the rose would have cost around $50 to have sent to our home and she should know that I'm not materialistic and rather economically minded as it had been discussed before. I almost get the feeling that she doesn't really understand me or that she has to prove her love to me with these kinds of gestures. To me it seems rather childish and irresponsible.\n\nThe question is: Should I have any right to be as upset as I am for this gesture? Or am I just being far to frugal and quick tempered?\nTL;DR:"}

The team is in-house and its clients are internal. That provides a difficulty in itself, but as the team is there to support others internally, we don't necessarily get 'juicy' work. We usually get the more routine based tasks. Here lies the problem. \nI have recently become a manager of a small group of people within this team. The team I'm in is seen by graduates as a bit of a stepping stone on to grander things, which isn't great and means that the retention in the team is low. The team is ambitious but this drive is focussed on what is after my team, not what is now. The 'routine' work we receive isn't enough to satiate them and this causes them to lash out demanding 'more training and better work!' It's difficult and I'd love to give them this 'better work', but we get what we get. There is some engagement with the rest of the company, but that is a slow process.    \n\nWe have a weekly 30 minute meeting. Last week I discussed that, although you might not be able to change the work you receive, you can change your attitude towards it. If you approach work with negative energy that is all you'll receive in return and vice versa. I told them that I couldn't force this change, it had to be a choice. The reaction I got was loud and angry. It took me off guard. There was a lot of accusation of no development, but that isn't the case. The point is, they're angry that we're not developing them for the next stage (which is nothing to do with us).    \n\nI used to look forward to these 30 minute meetings, but right now I'm struggling to find a topic and finding it even harder to find the motivation. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for five years, engaged for most of that time and have a sort of floating wedding date.\n\nThe optimistic part of me that hopes this will all get worked out thinks maybe this is just cold feet and adjusting to her medicine. The rest of me is worried maybe she's just outgrown me. She tells me I'm the most important person in her life, I'm her best friend, and she loves me more than even her family, but she doesn't know if she's still in love with me. Sometimes she still expresses that she's in love with me, but she's just not sure all the time anymore.\n\nWe were friends for years before we even started dating, best friends for two years before, and I know I can't bear to see her with anyone else.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [FL] My landlord gave us a 7 day notice to vacate (no cure) because our power got shut off\nPOST: To start, a little background. Our house has what is basically an upgraded shed behind it. That property is rented out all utilities included and it's utilities run off of our water and power. The landlord takes $100 off our rent to cover this, although this winter I showed her that a space heater costs far more than $3/day and she took off $200 the past few months.\n\nOn 2/2/15 we received a water bill alleging roughly 5x our normal usage. We notified the landlord and had the company do a water study, notifying us of a small leak, probably a toilet. We found that our extra toilet in a carpeted closet was leaking water and I turned off the water to it.\n\nOn 2/18/15 I went and spoke with our landlord, explaining that her faulty toilet caused the water bill and she told us how she always checks to make sure her toilets aren't leaking and we should be checking the tanks too. I explained that if she wasn't going to do anything, then with our normal budget I couldn't afford the water bill.\n\nOur power company offers pre-paid power at a discounted rate. So  I told her I have our rent, the water bill money and the power money for the week. Since I didn't wanna be late on the water, I would take the power money to pay the water bill that was twice its' normal amount. \n\nShe told me that my finances were my business and that it was up to me. I asked her if she was going to contact the lady behind us since her power was going to be off two days later. She said it wasn't fair for us to cut off her utilities, but it was up to me.\n\nThe power was turned off on 2/20/15. We returned on 2/22/15 and found a 7 day notice without cure alleging that we violated our agreement by letting the power be shut off and had repeatedly had problems with our utilities, although in 15 months nothing had happened before. Nothing in our rental agreement says anything about our providing utilities.\nTL;DR:"}

They were walking incredibly slowly, so I said excuse me to pass.  \n\nThey let me pass and then one man begins yelling at me about how rude I am.  I've never been called rude for saying excuse me before.  I said how was I rude?  He said that instead of saying excuse me and interrupting their conversation I should have walked around them all.  Again, they were taking up nearly the whole sidewalk.  I told him that if they weren't taking up the whole sidewalk, I wouldn't need to say excuse me in the first place.  \n\nThat's when he decided to pull the race card and say that I only did it because he was speaking Arabic and I'm racist.  WHAT?  For one thing, this has no relevance in what we were dealing with... sidewalk etiquette.  For another, I was raised in a culturally diverse area and have had acquaintances, friends, and even a few people I'd consider family of a similar background to him.\n\nSo by the end of the argument he's trash talking the both of us (my boyfriend and I) and I tell him to shut up, in his own language--which I sincerely think is a beautiful language.. even saying shut up sounds nice hahah.  That might have been wrong on my part, no excuses, I was mad.  I felt like I experienced a type of racism many people deny.  I was targeted as a racist because my \"lack of race\" (again, I'm mixed) and it fit into a defense for his struggle.\n\nWhat are your experiences with this?\nTL;DR:"}

Usually our budget is split into multiple categories (i.e Halloween activity, Christmas events Maid cafe[cringe warning]) And i needed to know specifically from which category we took the money from and exactly how much.\n\nAll I had prepared was a printed out excel sheet with little to no indication as to how the money was redistributed.

My boyfriend happens to have the same name as him.  He got a new number today, and before I had it saved as \"(his name) <3\", so there was never any ambiguity.  But, as I obviously don't text or call my professor, I had forgotten I even had his number, so I saved my bfs new number as \"(his name)\". \n\nPrior to class, I was with my boyfriend, so I hadn't texted him in hours while I had been texting other people, so our convo thread was close to the bottom of all my texts and lazy me just started a new text instead of going down.  Basically, the text went something along the lines of \"I can't wait to get done with this stupid class and get back into bed with you;)\" and without thinking, I sent it immediately to his name.  Except, it wasn't him.\n\nMy professors phone went off shortly after I sent it, and he said \"Sorry - My sister is having a baby, I need to check this\".  Alright, cool, but after he read it he got this really \"OMFGWTF\" look on his face and stammered that everyone should do some problem in the book.  It was weird, but he recovered.  After class, he asked me to stay a second, and we ended up fucking.  \n\nJust kidding, he told me to delete his number immediately as he could potentially get fired and I get in disciplinary trouble if anyone saw this, accident or not.  :(\nTL;DR:"}

He is my first relationship. \n\nTwo months in he broke up with me because he hated one of my friends. He got into another relationship almost immediately and when their thing ended, he started messaging me again and we got back together.\n\nLast year, he broke up with me only to get together with someone else within a week. Their relationship didn't last two weeks and then he wanted to get back together again, which I agreed.\n\nNow I'm just thinking about this, but this relationship makes me feel so insecure. I always feel the need to snoop (but I can't since we're long distance at the moment) because deep down there's always a part of me that's worried he's just talking to multiple girls so that there's one to date when he breaks up with me again. \n\nEvery single time is him breaking up with me (he wants to break up every month or so) and every time I want to get back together again. I hate myself for not being able to let go, but at the same time I really do love him more than anything. Am I stupid for feeling this way? If not, how can I stop myself from feeling like so shit all the time? I want to be able to trust him, but since technically he didn't exactly cheat on me since we were broken up at the time, I feel so much pain just thinking about it.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm bothered that she still regularly texts and hangs out with former fwbs. I believe that in a committed relationship, maintaining contact with former sexual partners is unacceptable (exes can be a rare exception). I get that my girlfriend's former fwbs are still her friends, just no longer with benefits, but I do not feel comfortable with my girlfriend hanging out with guys who used to fuck her. Call it insecurity, whatever. I find it completely unacceptable behavior.\n\nNow I don't do fwbs, I think the arrangement is stupid and classless, but I don't criticize others for doing so. I asked my girlfriend to cut contact with them and she got angry, calling me controlling and insecure, and saying that my request means I don't trust her. It's not that I don't trust her, it's that I don't trust the scenario of her hanging out with former fuckbuddies. Also, just being around the guys is humiliating. Just last week us and a lot of friends (including two of her former partners) were having dinner at a restaurant and I felt so ashamed that I was eating a meal alongside the guys who had sex with my girlfriend.\n\nMy girlfriend is fun and I enjoy the relationship but I don't want to be in a relationship in which I'm in close proximity with guys who used to fuck my girlfriend. If she asked me to cut contact with all former sexual partners I would do so out of respect for her wishes (and I have, I don't speak to any former partners). Am I justified in asking her to stop talking to her former fuckbuddies?\nTL;DR:"}

We had sex very early in the relationship (responsibly), and for the first few months, that was all it was. Then we started going out more, I met his family, and all that good stuff. \n\nWe've always gotten along fine with some minor arguments here and there. Lately, we've argued a lot, mainly because he always tries to undermine my decisions. For example, he told me he wasn't sure I would be able to handle my current job when I got it instead of congratulating me (for the record, I'm doing well). He acts as if I am inferior to him. I don't know if I'm overreacting or not.\n\nI zone out when he is talking, and things that he does irritate me a lot. I also don't want him touching or kissing me anymore. \n\nI don't know if that's how relationships work.

As the first year went by we began to argue more and more, which I take as mostly my fault. \n\nWe would argue about the stupidest things and then have arguments about very big things but would always manage to work through our problems. \n\nNow 4 months after our two year anniversary we got into a small argument that resulted in him going to his parents house. (We both are home for the summer). \nNormally when we argue and he is at my house he will leave to get over things and give us some space. This time it was to make a list of why to break up with me. \n\nHe came the next day and read me the list. I agreed that they were all valid reasons to break up with me and I did not deny any of the things he said and opened up to him about how controlling and manipulative I had been throughout our relationship. \n\nI broke down crying and he sat on the front porch with me until we actually started joking about things. For example he would say. \"your too pretty for me anyways\" and we would laugh about old times. \n\nI tried to talk to him about working things out but he said he had made his decision. Before he left he gave me one last kiss on the lips and left. \n\nIm not even sure what I am asking, I guess just to talk to someone. I have been in my room the last 4 days trying to cover up the fact that my heart is broken. I cant sleep, or eat, I feel physically ill, when I do try and sleep memories rush through my head and I cant help but cry. \n\nI also feel so bad because I have been extremely clingy after the relationship, talking to him and trying to mend things, even though I know he has made his decision. \n\nI am worried about the future, and comparing all future boyfriends to him, he had everything in common. If it wasnt for me starting all of those stupid fights I feel like I would still have him and it kills me. \n\nI cant even stand the thought of seeing him with someone else.\nTL;DR:"}

I began waving / flapping my hands over the candle. It began as a slow flap but got more and more aggressive to the point where I was really putting a lot of effort in... and then I got too close.\n\nI smacked the candle at about 800mph and molten wax flew everywhere. It spread the entire distance of the glass kitchen table, ruined the shirt I was wearing, and worst of all, absolutely covered my macbook.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Working next-door to Homeopathic Clinic - How should I prank them?\nPOST: I work in an area that used to be residential, but now is a bunch of businesses in renovated craftsman homes. Signage is definitely poor, so its kind of hard to find businesses in the area. I was walking my boss' dog for a break, and realized the building next door is actually a homeopathic clinic. \n\nNow, I understand this might get some downvotes, but I really am not a fan of homeopathic medicine. I think that it is essentially a scam that encourages people not to take medicine that might actually help them. I don't want to get into a debate about homeopathic medicine. I know that doing any sort of pranks will probably make me burn in hell or whatever. \n\nUnfortunately, there is a SHOCKING amount of police activity in the area. You actually have to drive under 25, and there is a cop within 3 blocks of you at any time, and they patrol the streets REGULARLY. So I need some pranks that aren't likely to point right back to me, or back to my company. (Company only has 3 people who work from the office 5 days a week and I'm one of them.)\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: (24F) Is becoming super jaded about relationships just part of life?\nPOST: I've been around the block with dating. I've had boyfriends and dates since I was in middle school. I've had multiple long-term relationships, a couple multi-month long ordeals, and a few things that fizzled after a date or two. I've been technically single for a year, but I've been on some dates.\n\nI'm so jaded. It's bad and pretty excessive. I've been cheated on, lied to, led on, etc. and I know this has happened to everyone, but how can I combat these thoughts and stay positive?\n\nFor example, these days I'm really not even interested in dating because I figure every dude I go out with is gonna end up a liar or a cheat anyway, so why bother? On first dates I'm trying to figure out if he's a pedophile, a sociopath, I mean what is it? (No shit, I did date a guy who was a sociopath last year, and when I found out, I couldn't have run faster) What's wrong with this one? I see people married for 30 years who lie and cheat on one another. My friends tell me their coworkers all go out of town and have double lives in other cities and lie to their significant others. I don't hear much about happy relationships except for my parents, who are so in love that they're renewing their vows this weekend. This is the only successful love story I see. Statistically, any relationship is doomed to misery, and my experiences are starting to align with that notion.\n\nI've raised my standards and I don't date the type of dudes I did a few years ago. Recently, I dated a guy a few years older than me who had a great job, great apartment, good family, etc. and it all checked out. He turned out to be a total dud and started treating me like a booty call.\n\nI've been to a few therapy sessions, but bizarrely enough, my therapist has said she isn't sure how to help me. I just want to stop feeling like every guy is a piece of shit. I want some hope again. How do I find it? I'm going to take a break from dating for a while.\nTL;DR:"}

He fell in love with me while I was dating someone else, and when that boyfriend and I broke up, K and I got together a little after.\n\nK lives in Cali, while I live on the east coast, and while nothing about a long distance relationship is easy, I thought that he was the one for me. Great communication, affectionate, everything I could ask for. \n\nWe had our fair share of issues, but it always seemed worth the struggle. K is supposed to come back to the east coast soon, but in order to do that, he became extremely stressed and extremely busy. He warned me a week in advance that communication would slow a bit. But I wasn't prepared to get a text from him once every five hours, short and curt, and so polar from how we normally communicate.  After nearly a week of this, I freaked out. I asked him if he was acting this way because he felt differently (the classic fade out), or why (when he actually did respond) was he so short with me. He got frustrated with me, obviously. Looking back, I knew my insecurities took hold, and it wasn't fair to him.\n\nWe broke up soon after this happened. He admitted that me being too needy was part of it- That although I know he loves me, I need to hear him say it to be completely sure. The same way I knew he warned me he was going to be busy while he's in the process of coming home, but having no reassurance for a week made me flip out.\n\nI don't know how to stop being this way. My logic knows whats going on. But the emotions I feel fuck with my mind, and it's so hard to ignore.\nTL;DR:"}

So I said no, and that I didn't think juniors went to prom. I told her that no one had asked me and that I really couldn't be bothered going through the stress of trying to find a date(Ironic, eh?). After this she very provocatively says, \"Well I was really hoping you were going to ask me...\". I exchange looks of shock with the guy sitting across from me and promptly respond, \"Serious?\". She says yes and turns around as the bell rings.\n\nSo I'm pretty sure I should have asked her right on the spot, but being the enormous female reproductive organ that I am, I asked her friend if she was being serious(You can never be too careful!). I guess I was right to take this approach to the situation because apparently she was already going with another guy!!!\n\nI came to school in a surprisingly happy mood today, mostly because I was about to play super smash bro's in my AP Computer Science class! I see her later in the day and we exchange flirty banter, but nothing regarding what she said yesterday. After our last class together she surprises me and we walk together. I immediately bring up what she had said and she tried to blow it off, so I being a little heated said, \"It's no big deal... I wasn't even going anyways.\" \n\nI decided to not walk with her to our cars out of spite and frustration. This must have sparked something inside her because now she's sent me 4 snapchats in the last couple hours that are really flirty. I took some time to think about how I feel and at first I thought it really wasn't a big deal, but now I'm pretty torn up because who the F**K DOES THAT?!?!\nTL;DR:"}

The only way that we corresponded was through email. I was definitely skeptical about the situation, but desperate to get some trees, so I decided to take the risk. He seemed legit, but there were some things that just weren't adding up. He entered my car and told me that I had to give him the money and he'd be right back out.

Sorry for possible grammar mistakes, please note I am not a native a English speaker.\n\nWe have went apart with my GF a week ago. I really don't want to get into the details, long story short, our relationship sucked in many ways. We were never true friends and never been connected to each other, we just tried to pretend it and on the top is this, we were not able to communicate. Not at all. Therefore, we are both a 100000% sure about that we never want to be a couple again. We are living together unfortunately until she moves and we would like to be pals in future. We were good in sleeping together, having sex and we were absolutely cute. I mean cute like we are not humans, but two little fluffy creatures from a different planet. Also we were good in practical stuff, like cooking, keeping the house clean, etc. Now we are trying to be apart during the day, however, we are sleeping together because it feels good, really good. We were also great at sleeping.\n\nMy question would be that spending a day with her together like in the old days is good or bad idea? I'm thinking of going on a date, being cute with each other, having sex and cuddling, do thins where we were very good at. In a normal case I would say that's a terrible idea, but considering that we are sure about that we don't want to be with each other never again I wouldn't say it's that bad. The reason of this last day is that we would like to remember the good things of our relationship, because it was so cute on it's own way.\n\nThanks very much in advance for sharing your thoughts :)\nTL;DR:"}

Being the awkward penguin that I am, I don't ask anyone where this room is. I check the clock, shit, I'm late. I sprint down the steps figuring I'll just start on the first floor and work my way up. I reach the first floor and stop dead in my tracks. There it was..........exactly where I'd been waiting.\nTL;DR:"}

She talks to me for 8 hours a day sometimes. We never got a chance to develop our relationship as I had to leave the country and when I got back she was gone. Now we are in touch again and we talk so much, and she teases me a lot. When she comes back she wants to live with me. Here is the tricky part, she is a bit wild and kind of like a gypsy and has some fucked up friends and a lot of issues of her own, she is a source of great stress to me. How do I make this girl understand that if she wants to be with me she is going to have to understand that I am very tired of life and I don't want any drama from her or her other male friends involved in my life. That all I want to do is sit somewhere and try to mend my heavy, bleeding heart. Will she understand?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Advice re choosing between vanguard ETF and vanguard (managed) index (AUS)\nPOST: In Australia, [Vanguard's index funds] have comparatively high (to the US Vanguard) management costs - 0.70%-0.90% for first $50,000, decreasing in $50,000 increments until a balance is > $100,000. The funds are managed, which was not something I was looking for either. \n\nOn the other hand, [Vanguard ETFs] have management costs between 0.05%-0.30%, but would obviously incur a brokerage fee per transaction. Prices vary, but from what I can tell, in Australia this varies between $14.95 - $19.95 per transaction. \n\nI was thinking perhaps with the lower managements costs the ETFs might be the way to go. Regarding brokerages costs, to make it more cost-effective, one strategy might be to direct the money I would have had auto-deducted into the index fund into a high-earning interest account (3.50%), and only making a transaction in $5,000 blocks. But then again, this might be harder to do with multiple ETFs - i.e. I'll be doing everything in large chunks every few months and asset allocation might be a hassle. Also, it's less... 'passive' than I hoped my investment style would be - I like the idea of having an amount deducted automatically before I see it so I don't have to emotionally engage with the market etc.\n\nAnd a last point,  I used Vanguard's fund comparison tool to compare, as an example, the Vanguard Australian Shares High Yield ETF and the Vanguard High Yield Australian Shares Fund. [These are the results] As one would except, literally everything is the same except for the '12 month yield' percentages - the ETF has a 12 month yield of 7.43% and the index fund has 11.94%. Is this the result of fund management? Or is this the result of dividends being automatically reinvested into the fund?\nTL;DR:"}

She said that it was nothing that I did and that she just needs time to figure out what she is doing with her life(Medical school). She also said that she has changed since we started dating  and because of it, she feels too dependent on me. She specifically told me that she wasn't breaking up with me (I'm still skeptical) and that she loved me very much and that she can see an amazing future with me (also skeptical). \n\nWhat makes me confused is we don't spend that much time together to see why a break would be necessary. We live about 45 minutes away from each other because of my job and I just got back from a 2-week long vacation with my family. We have never had any big arguments however she does seem to be stressed all the time due to school.  \n\nTo top it off we have a trip to Europe planned to visit her mom and dad at the end of August!!! She said she didn't want me to go anymore and that she would take care of my ticket. I don't know what to say to her. I'm so hurt that she would even consider that since it's something we've both been looking forward to for awhile now. She texted me yesterday and told me that she loved me and that I was so great for understanding. \n\nShe wants to talk about it a little more next week in person. Should I expect the worse? Should I reach out to her? This has never happened to me before and I'm so confused. Any advice or experience would be much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I regularly drive several friends to practice as well because the bay we used is a like 30 minute drive away. So anyway after practice we wanted to go to this drive-thru coffee shop. One of my friends on the team let's call her [x], wants to drive to the place, which is like a 3 minute drive away. She's only 16 and doesn't have her license yet, (this is the US, license age is 16), but I had let people drive before, and it wasn't very far so I said sure. \n\nLong story short, she crashes the car by trying to take a left turn from the center lane (it was a 3 lane road) and hitting a truck. She freaks out and begs me to talk to him and say I was driving, as if she gets caught she would get a fine and lose her license possibility till 18.\n\nBeing a stupid highschool kid, I acquiesced, and as far as anyone knows (except our friends) it was me driving. The total damage was $1200, which we paid out of pocket to avoid a huge insurance increase. [x] said she would pay me back,  but this was OVER A YEAR AGO. Almost 1.5 years actually. She has had jobs on and off, but every time I ask her about it she gives some excuse and says \"she's trying but it's hard.\" \n\nYet she goes to concerts, parties etc, and 1.5 years is easily enough time to get 1200 dollars. So far she's paid be ~75 dollars. \n\nThe problem: Since as far as anything legal goes, I crashed the car (yes I'm an idiot), so how can I get this money from her?\nTL;DR:"}

I've put a lot of time and spent a lot of long nights writing this book and now my goal is to get it published. Rather than go a traditional route of publication I've decided to go through Kickstarter.\n\nNecromancer: The corruption revolves around the tale of a young elf named Fayne who is set in the book to take the trial of becoming a Keeper of the Equinox.

What do I do?\nPOST: So for background, we have always had a close relationship, spending hours talking to each other and hanging out. Recently I have been out of town for about a month. We still communicated a lot towards the beginning of the trip but after a few weeks she began to not talk as much and would ignore me occasionally.\n\n A few days ago she told me out of the blue that she started liking another guy at a camp she was at. However, I was informed it was nothing serious and that she would not pursue any further. I was bothered by this but did not get angry or in a fight with her because of her feeling strongly that it was a wrongdoing on her part. Things became a little awkward after our conversation. \nImmediately after that, she tells me that she will be very busy in the near future (I'm not sure if she actually is). Now, instead of talking for hours like we usually would, I would receive only a couple halfhearted messages a day. I am trying to talk to her more but she would often either ignore my messages or give a one word answer saying she has to go. I love her very much and don't want this relationship to go to waste over something so trivial.\n\nI haven't asked her about the guy after the conversation and have initiated conversations to no avail. I recognize that I am the jealous type and can often be overly attached. I am still not in town for a few more weeks.

Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. We don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go whooosh and it's gone.\" \n\nNow that you have the proper mental image of what this man was wearing, you must now understand why we were disconcerted when the portly fellow decided to stretch. And man could he stretch.\n\nHe pulled of a perfect forward bend - that would make any yogi proud - at the base of the lifeguard chair, under the guise of \"using the chair as a support\". So instead of watching the pool, we got a face full of old speedo man ass. I would not recommend. \n\nSince stretching is technically allowed on the deck, and since he was technically wearing swimming attire, there was nothing we could do about it.\n\nUntil one of my genius co-workers absconded with the laminating machine and made a very official looking \"Designated Stretching Zone\" sign, complete with Word 97 clip art. We hung it in the back corner, away from children, lifeguards, or basically anyone with eyes.\n\nStretchy man stopped coming to the pool soon after.\nTL;DR:"}

We currently live in different parts of the world, 13 time zones apart.\n\nSo here's the story. I met this girl online through a dating site earlier this month and we were planning to meet but we ended up not meeting due to conflicting schedules. I had to leave the country to work in San Francisco for a year so we ended up not being able to set a future date to meet (I had contacted her a week before my departure so the timing was really tight). However, we've been texting and Skyping almost everyday since and it seems like we've been building some strong feelings for each other despite having never met.\n\nI've done long distance relationships before but they ended badly. They were the usual type of relationships, getting together first then one of us had to leave for college etc. This time, however, it's purely an online relationship. It's brand new and novel to me and I am unsure as to how to proceed. Am I wasting my time if I spend all my time with this girl and not meeting new people in my new environment? If I pursue a long distance cyber relationship in the hope of making this a real relationship after a year how can I keep this relationship exciting and positive with only Skype, texting and digital tools?\n\nThat's about it. I'm just a little unsure as to what to do next but the signs look positive for now. Your advice is appreciated! :)\nTL;DR:"}

(and now we see the archetype forming, sigh.)\n\ni don't know, i had gone between being convinced of his straightness-to utterly positive that he must be gay. i am no longer unsure of his sexuality. he's not bigoted, or anything, but he has some misconceptions about what gay men should be, and assumed that unless they were incredibly flamboyant they weren't gay, and if they were, it was immensely creepy.\n\ni almost died when i heard this from him. up until then i had thought, almost for sure, that he knew, that he realized that i was gay, and that maybe he even liked me back a little? i don't know. this turned into a sob story, but my question to you, is what to do from here?\n\ni really do care about him so much, and i don't want the fact that i'm gay fucking up our friendship. we had done mundane things like change in front of each other and other horseplay nonsense like that, and i fear that he will find the fact that he did that with a gay guy freak him out. (i never really thought of it in a sexual way- i don't know..but i feel horribly guilty as though i almost had taken advantage of him..) i can get over my feelings for him. that will just take time, i guess, but i dont want to lose him as a friend.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [20 M] have a weird feeling about my SO [19 F] and her coworker [24 M]\nPOST: My SO and I have been together for over a year. She is an introvert with social anxiety. She doesn't talk to many people and when she does, it's quick conversations and she very rarely starts the conversation. However, my SO started a new job a few weeks ago. Her one coworker and her became friends pretty quickly. \n\nThey began talking and talking about hanging out. He bgan telling her how pretty she is and that he can't stop thinking about her. After he told her that he likes her and she told him that she has a boyfriend, she's on her phone texting him almost all the time. She told me that she doesn't like him and they're just friends but it just feels weird.\n\nToday, he told her that he doesn't think that they should keep talking because it doesn't feel like it would be good for him to keep talking to her. Now, she's very upset and says that she has to get over it. Giving me very short answers and saying that she respects his decision and that she'll be fine.\n\nI just want to know if I'm looking too much into this or not?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: 28/m my girlfriend 27/f dating two years she panics and breaks up. What do I do?\nPOST: We've known each other for almost four years but found one another two years ago and started your storybook romance. She had never been with anyone before in a serious way and I had never really been with the right woman, a good woman that is to say. We fell in the kind of love that makes it seem like the universe is smiling down on you. It was the best thing that ever happened in my life. She was studying for the bar, I supported her through it and through the first few months of her job at law school. Things started to get tough when she was working 70-80 hour weeks, I was extremely supportive but she was clearly unhappy with her job and it made her distant from everything, her friends, family, and me. Then a few weeks ago she said she'd looked around at her friends all getting married and she wanted to make sure that I was the right man for her life. I told her I completely understood how she was feeling and that it's terrible to be trapped, I don't want to stand in the way of her happiness. Still, it completely tore my life apart. Two weeks on and I can't stop thinking about her, can't eat/sleep well. Sometimes she calls to tell me she's thinking about me, she always tells me she loves me. She is certain this is something she has to do. Now, from everything my friends tell me this is basically the end of the relationship. I should let go and just let her go live her life. What do I do when that feels so wrong? I want her to have that peace of mind she never got from life, but I also just really love her and feel this impossibly strong conviction that we're meant to be together. Naieve I know but I can't help how my gut is. Am I wrong to believe?\n\nThank you in advance for your time.\nTL;DR:"}

I know ovulation and position could play a part in this, maybe even the way we were fucking since it had been a while, but she never had air trapped inside her like this before and it was honestly a little shocking.\n\nI guess a critical question would be, if air was trapped inside there by a dildo or a dick, how long could it stay in there?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Fell off the wagon\nPOST: This would be my 3rd week of my weight loss journey;so far I have been pretty good. I have been eating well going to gym at least 5 times a week. I do yoga and pilates twice a week on those days I would do 30 or 40 mins of cardio before or after. On the days that I don't do yoga or pilates I do an hour of cardio and some weights (rarely though). \n\nI have been eating fairly healthy I would have oatmeal in the morning with a banana, blueberries with cinnamon on top or I would have a smoothie with spinach, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. For lunch I would usually have a spinach salad loaded with veggies or a hard boiled egg or with chicken. Dinner I would have the same as my lunch maybe with some greek yogurt for desert. But this week I caved and I had McDonalds one of my coworkers got it for me and I felt bad saying no. I have only been to the gym once this week and I am going to go today but even missing the gym has put me in a sour mood and unmotivated.  Now I have lost all motivation and that  I can't break my old habits and that I am never going to lose weight.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Probably running into an ex I haven't seen in months next weekend, so this'll be fun, right?\nPOST: If you want backstory, I actually [posted in RA about this] a while back. I was gonna post this in RA as well but seeing as I don't want to use the word \"relationship\" to describe the ex and myself, I'm posting here. Since that post I've seen her once more at a New Years Eve party (I was sick so I stayed in my mate's room, she did come to say hi and then get all passive-aggressive about me deleting her). She also tried to re-add me once or twice.\n\nAnyway, a mutual friend is having her 21^st next weekend and obviously I'm not going to miss it. There's a very good chance the ex will be there - Attending on Facebook, which allegedly never lies... I'm well over her and not too concerned about seeing her, but I don't really know how I can approach talking to her and everything. I would like to be able to talk to her like two human beings who know each other well, talk about life etc but I don't want her thinking by the end of the night that we're going to be good friends again. I don't want to have to start this endless cycle of ignoring her friend requests.\n\n1. Am I an out-and-out jerk for not wanting anything to do with her? I'm pretty sure at this point I'm not, and my defence is as follows: Every time we do start talking again, I always get feelings of anger and revile at how things turned out and how we went. I don't want to feel that, ergo I don't want to talk to her.\n\n2. What are good ways of dealing with the situation? I feel ignoring her all night would be immature, but if we sit and talk I run the risk of a D&M, questions of \"Can we go have lunch and catch up\" or an argument which I really don't want.\n\n3. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it, good or bad? I'd love to hear other stories, even more than I'd love to hear advice.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dogs\nTITLE: My dog will eat almost anything.  Anyone else have this problem, and what have you done to solve it?\nPOST: I have a 5 year old red Doberman that will eat anything.  Socks, tissues, bandannas, cotton swabs, pretty much anything she can find.  We have bought trashcans with lids for the whole house and tried *stay away* sprays, but she still manages to find things to eat.  We literally cannot turn our backs for a minute and she has ninja'd something from somewhere.  The more we restrict access to the house, the weirder and weirder the items get that she eats (most recently a syllabus for a class).  Both our dogs are crate trained, so we are at the point that she needs to be locked up anytime we can't keep both eyes on her.  She has a doggy door to a big back yard, and she plays a lot and gets exercise.  She has been thru obedience school, so it's not the inability to be trained.  She has had surgery once to remove a corn cob from her stomach (this is what spurred the trashcans with lids), and most recently, almost had to have surgery again because she swallowed a washrag, and almost didn't pass it.  I mowed the lawn the other day and found over 16 ankle socks that she had eaten and pooped out.  We are at out wits end, and fear for her safety, but we both have to work, and can't just leaver her locked up all day.  Any advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

After everyone else went home, we ended up back at his house, watched a film, one thing led to another and we slept together. When we woke up the next morning we lay in bed pretty much all day, it wasn't awkward, which was nice!\n\nSince then we've been texting on and off, and at work he seems to be a lot more flirty/touchy when we are talking. He's started complimenting me a lot more, which I guess is a good sign of his interest? We've also started staying late at work when we're shut and just sitting chatting for an hour or two. I feel like we click very well, and I quite like him, but I'm unsure if he feels the same way. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm reading too much into it, and I really don't want to make work awkward.

We've been dating for 6 years, living together in an apartment for 2 of those years. \n\nI am self employed and work from home. She recently got promoted to a \"district manager\" position and now works from home as well. For the last 3 months we see each other 10-14 waking hours a day. I'd consider myself an introvert and value my solitude, so this new living situation has made my life miserable.\n\nLast week she left for a 3 day work conference, and those were the happiest days I'd had in a while. On the day she due home I was depressed and not looking forward to seeing her at all. This was the first instance I started considering a breakup.\n\nYesterday we got into a fight, and I expressed my feelings - that we're spending way too much time together, that I've been developing negative feelings toward her because of it. Her 'solution' was that we buy a house for more workspace. This is something we considered doing in a couple years when I our finances were sound. In my current state of mind, I view it as a $250-300k gamble. Every instinct is telling me it's not a good idea to enter into such a commitment with a mind full of doubt.\n\nTo her that is the ONLY course of action. When I asked if she would entertain other ideas, she became hostile. Our fight ended unresolved. \n\nThe way she disregarded my feelings and only suggested something that advanced her own agenda/interests made me realize that we're no longer in sync, and that a breakup is the only option I'm left with to get the space I desire. \n\nThis is my first serious relationship. I'd only ever had flings in the past, never actually had to break up with someone. I have no idea how to do it. I still care for her and want her to be happy. I want us breaking up to be as amicable as possible. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated. Thanks for your time.\nTL;DR:"}
