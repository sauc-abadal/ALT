{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Make her feel good enough to be with me\nPOST: So I've been (23/m) dating a girl (21) for 7 months now and in the beginning she wasn't the girl who she is today. She was kind of selfish, baby of the family, always about herself and very unaffectionate towards me. So as time went on we liked each other more but these things started stopping me from liking her more so i obviously brought this up with her. Not as a discussion for break up, but obstacles I saw that stopped me from liking her more and she worked on them. I am really falling for her hard but when I say somethings to her, for example she said something which seemed like a tit for tat thing, o said that seems very tit for tat and she was hurt by it and rightly so thinking back on it. \n\nIt hurt her more because she thinks she will never be good enough for me. Like fuck me, I hate that I can't make her feel good enough. I've vowed to not call her out for something unless it really bothers me and think it will jeopardize this relationship but I haven't brought anything up for a while and she still feels this way. How can I get her to feel like she is good enough?? I tell her she is amazing and that I'm a lucky guy but she still doesn't feel good enough. Suggestions please?!\nTL;DR:"}

Over time I've gotten into multiple online arguments with her regarding little issues.\n\nThe first was the fact that I jokingly refused to give her the name of an app while talking to her in a group chat. She sends a wall of text telling me how I'm a horrible person and ignores me for a month \n\nNext, after apologizing, I shared some intimate information with her (I had become close to her because she would snap me every night til midnight) and the next morning she told me to leave her alone. So I deleted her Snapchat and left her alone as she wanted.\n\nAnother month later and she asks to follow me again and acts like nothing happened, resuming intimate conversations.\n\nThere are other more personal issues recently but a big one is when she told everyone out of the blue in group chat that \"men are all naturally narcissistic\" I called her out on it privately and she acted like I was oppressing her, I am aware that she is Heterosexual and single, so why would she start this?\n\nMonths ago she invited me to a party and I question if I want to do anything with her, everything she does and says to me is an emotionally charged roller coaster\nTL;DR:"}

We ended up meeting and really liking each other. A few weeks go by and he comes clean that he isn't actually 35, but that he's 41.\n\nHe explained to me that when we first started talking that he never thought that either of us would want to meet, and that we wouldn't meet. Then when we did meet, he didn't think that we'd like each other.  Now things are progressing towards something more serious.\n\nWhen I started seeing him, I told my mom about it and she thinks he is 35.  She's completely fine with that, as long as I'm happy.  Since I've found out his actual age I find it hard to keep it from her, especially since she's made general comments about the age difference in a joking manner.  \n\nHow do I tell her that the guy I'm seeing is actually 6 years older than what he initially told me?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [24M] girlfriend [25F] RSVP'd for me for a wedding I don't want to go to.\nPOST: So a few days ago my girlfriend (of 6 years) tells me that a girl she had graduated high school with called her and invited her to her wedding next Saturday, and I was welcome to come too. She accepted and told her we could both come, because she was never really close friends with this girl, so if she's asking her she must be kind of desperate for people to invite. However, my girlfriend forgot that I already had plans to go to an event on the same day at the same time.\n\nI reminded her of my plans and she apologized for forgetting, but said that I would have to go since she already RSVP'd for me. I told her I wasn't happy that she RSVP'd without asking me first since it's someone I don't even really know and she hardly knows, and asked her if she could possibly call her back and tell her I couldn't make it. She said she wouldn't because she'd feel really bad since she acted so excited when she told her we could go. She also said she doesn't even really want to go either, but is basically doing it because she feels bad for her.\n\nSo the bottom line is that I don't want to go because I'd have to cancel my previous plans, but my girlfriend is telling me I have to. I already do stuff like this with her *all the time*, so I feel like one day to do what I want isn't asking for much. If this was her best friend or something, then yeah, I'd understand. How do we resolve this reasonably?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: Hooked up with someone to get over my ex (F19). Now I (M20) immensely regret it. Has anyone got advice on dealing with the guilt?\nPOST: So my ex dumped me three days ago. She was my first love, so I feel devastated. Yesterday, I decided to go partying with friends in order to get over her.\n\nAfter a couple of beers, a girl with a ton of tattoos, three facial piercings and an undercut joined us. She got along well with some of my friends, but I didn't really know her.\n\nNow, my ex-girlfriend was always quite conservatively dressed. A huge contrast with this girl. I normally find facial piercings and excessive tattoos a huge turnoff. But I was drunk, and still miserable about my ex. My drunk reasoning led me to believe that if I were to enjoy myself with a girl who's nothing at all like my ex, then I'd prove I don't need her.\n\nYes, I know there are some terrible flaws in that logic.\n\nSo when this girl started showing interest, I took her apart and we started kissing. At the time I thought it'd feel good, but as soon as our lips touched I felt regret. She kept going though, and I didn't push her away because I was afraid of hurting her feelings.\n\nOne of my friends caught us. We were a little embarrassed and decided to join the group again. When the evening progressed, she told me she'd like my number so we could meet up again sometime. I decided to be honest and told her that I still had feelings for my ex, and didn't see myself dating anyone any time soon. She was disappointed, but she took it rather well.\n\nAll that happened yesterday. Needless to say, I still feel terrible about what I did. It felt so wrong to kiss someone I didn't care about. I feel like an immense jackass for how I behaved towards that girl. I treated her like a toy to get over my ex, and I feel terrible about it. I thought I was better than that. And now...\n\nFuck. I just want this feeling to go away.\n\nSo my question is: has anyone got advice on dealing with the immense shame and guilt I'm feeling?\nTL;DR:"}

We both feel/felt very strongly towards each other.\n\nNormally I sleep with girls I am seeing withing the first couple of dates, however I liked this girl so much that we held off on sex since we enjoyed each other company so genuinely much.\n\nFast forward to last night. She came over and I cooked her dinner and we watched a movie. She was very tired after to movie so decided to sleep over. So we both got ready for bed, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Like most mid-20s individuals would.\n\nHere is where I lost her trust. I contracted Herpes a few years ago, I am on medication, am always sure to use protection and inform my partners. I had planned on telling her extremely soon, like this weekend. However, one thing led to another last night and in the heat of the moment I did not tell her.\n\nSo today I spoke to her about it and naturally she is extremely upset and is having a hard time trusting me. I cannot blame her. I made a massive mistake. She is not upset with the fact I am HSV positive, but that I didn't inform her.\n\nI feel awful, just awful and want to make things right. I really like this girl. She wants her space, which I totally understand. I explained to her that I would do whatever it takes to earn her trust back. She agreed that would be very noble of me. I don't want to let her down. I can tell she is special even after only a month of dating.\n\nWhat can I do to help alleviate the issue and help earn her trust back?\nTL;DR:"}

But, I'm already seeing a dynamic that I'm not fond of. And honestly, I think it's a little weird. Hope you guys can tell me your thoughts.\n\nI started seeing a guy about 3 weeks ago. We initially met online, but have been hanging out since.  He's been pretty open and honest about most things (wanting a serious relationship eventually, wanting kids one day ,etc. I am in agreeance with those things) , and we like each other a lot. \n\nHe's very close with his best friends (of course), and he mentioned how they go fishing together every Saturday. He makes jokes about how their relationship is super \"gay\", and they are basically friend soulmates. I was like, cool, sometimes I feel that way about my friends. No big deal.\n\nOn our first date, he told me how he'd been talking to his best friend before he got there, hoping things went well. His best friend also texted continuously throughout the date.\n\nI told him I was going away for the weekend, but I might have time to hang out this Friday before I left. He seemed excited, but then cancelled about 30 minutes later, saying his best friend was pissed because he was under the impression that they were hanging out Friday.\n\nThis is only the second time this has happened, and yes, we did hang out another time when it happened initially.\n\nBut I do find this a little....weird.\n\nOn one hand, I'm nobody right? Just some girl he's been seeing. I understand that. No hard feelings about that.\n\nOn the other hand, I think it is a little strange, and I wonder, indicative of how any relationship with us might be like. Is he saying his best friend will always have priority over me/any girl?\n\nThis feels weirdly....middle school.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for only a few months - her family has known nothing about this (I was actually just starting to hang out around them when we found out that she's pregnant). We've been sneaking around, having a secret relationship. Her family is incredibly religious and her parents have not taken the news of her pregnancy lightly. They've only known for about a week, so maybe they just need time to process the information. However, they leave for Africa in roughly two months (they would be back a month before her due date) and all I've seen of my girlfriend the past week is half an hour on her porch. She seems really unhappy, and I feel like her parents aren't thinking about what she needs as much as what they want - they won't open their eye's and accept that the two of us made a mistake together and we want to try to get through the difficulties caused by that mistake together. I think it's wrong that I'm not able to be by her side during her pregnancy and show her that I support her. Is there anything that I can do to make her parents realize that I'm going to be in her life and that not allowing us to see each other is doing nothing but creating factions where a group is needed?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been working on my thesis for the last year, while at the same time working on the business me and my girlfriend created. My counsellor kinda screwed up a month ago an I basically had to redo the whole thing, with the deadline being the end of February.\n\nAt the beginning of January, and because everything was going as planned, she booked a trip back home (3000km away) to celebrate a family holiday, and asked me to go too on the second week she'd be there. I agreed, got excited, made plans and booked the flight.\n\nAfter I realised that I had to redo everything in such a short time, I started to panic. I started working exclusively on my thesis from 7AM to 01AM everyday, and she took care of getting our products shipped. Eventually, she took the flight back home, and because I drove her so early in the morning, it completely screwed up my schedule. And that's what I didn't count on - that there would be days when I wouldn't be at full productive capacity and things would get delayed.\n\nFast forward to this Friday. My counsellor called with more corrections and told me we had to schedule a meeting this Tuesday. He has a very, very limited availability and since I'd only come back a week before the deadline, it would be too tight. So I told my girlfriend about this and she said she'd understand, even though she'd be sad. Saturday, I cancelled the flight to at least make some money back. And then I told her about that.\n\nShe still expected me to come, and when I told her I canceled the flight, she basically made it sound like it was all my fault, and that I didn't really want to go. I wish I could make it up to her, and I feel powerless for being so far away. What do you suggest?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest\nTITLE: Why do I feel anxious and guilty?\nPOST: I've been feeling guilty ever since my first semester of college ended. \n\nI actually did pretty well, got all solid A's for all my classes and also managed to get a job within campus.But ever since the semester ended, I feel guilty and anxious for not doing any work at all. While I did ace my first semester, my classes were ridiculously easy. In my General Psych class I consistently received extra credit for simply meeting the requirements and also receiving over 85% on exams, which have also been spoon-fed to the class. My intro to Arts and Media class never felt like a challenge and I could feel that my professor was  a relatively easy grader. Our midterm consisted of questions that were handed to us during the first month of class and had 50 questions that were easy to memorize. I also took a fluffed-up freshman required class that was pretty meaningless overall. There are people here who do not understand MLA format despite the professor explaining it repeatedly. \n\nThe only class where I felt like I was learning anything or being challenged was my Trigonometry class. This was the only class where I felt a need to actively study for. While it is definitely a lower-level class compared to some people who start off freshman year with Calc, this class was a good refresher while also bringing in new insight for math. I felt the most involved with this class and had a sense of fulfillment. \n\nI am definitely not complaining about the ease of receiving grades, but I feel deeply anxious that the next semester will be significantly harder and that this semester did not prepare me well enough for it. College so far has been easier than high school.\n\nI'm not really sure what I'm saying when I type this out but I'm just worried that this is just not real college, and that I am just someone who is mediocre and stands out among other students who are not focused on academics. I feel like this is all just coming out wrong and its nothing to worry about, but I just need to say this.\nTL;DR:"}

She is absolutely incoherent and is making no sense whatsoever and starts screaming/crying/freaking out all at the same time. I don't do drugs, but I've seen enough people on them through my job, so it was obvious that she was on something. She is an attractive girl who was dressed up for clubbing, but was hanging out with this group of seedy/creepy looking thugs outside a strip club, who were trying to take advantage of her.\n\nSo, essentially, because she had no friends around (I tried calling everyone that she knew from my phone, including her parents - nobody answered), I couldn't just leave her there, drugged out of her mind on the side of the street in the middle of the night. I couldn't live with myself if she got attacked or raped or worse and I knew that I could have helped her. So I take her to my car and we go back to my place and I set her up on the couch to sleep. I also made sure to leave water/hand towels next to her and a note saying where she was if she woke up and started panicking. \n\nIn the morning, I hear her get up and go out to see her, and she starts laying into me.

Okay it was about 12 months ago that I broke up with her because she lied and cheated on me and definately hurt my feelings. Then she wanted to be friends. This was probably the most demasculating situatioin i ever went through in my life is being her friend at that time becasue i was severely hurt by her. So i told her off and told her i dont want to speak to her for a while. With some success this has happened but for some reason even though that she was a complete and utter horrible person that destroyed me. \n\nto put it lightly she basically really tore me a new one in the world of relationships i think she personally crushed my self esteam and ego for sometime now and has made it so i am timid shy and shakey around any girl that gives any kind of attraction to me the point that they think that i may be gay.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Did my childhood abuse cause my body to reject food?\nPOST: First of all: Female, 19, 5'11\", 141lbs.  \n  \nI was abused from ages 4 to 9. If I was fed I was given either 2 slimy okra pods, a cup of lima beans, a corn dog, or chicken broth. I would often go 2-3 days without food, and longer without water.  \n  \nAfter my abuser left, I was fed copious amounts of food in order to gain weight. I could easily slip my entire body through a wire hanger, and in less than a year I had put on so much weight that I was wearing a girls size 12. I remained plump until I was 13.  \n  \n  \nAt age 14 I began to notice that it was difficult to hold down food. I would throw up a little bit at a time ~30 minutes after ingesting a meal. 80% of the time the entire meal would come back up. At first, it would only happen after a regular-sized meal. Eventually drinking 16oz of water too quickly would cause it to happen. I started eating less and less to avoid \"spitting up\".   \n  \nI have been seen by two different doctors and neither were able to figure out what my problem was. I have had an ultrasound, an IVP, and an upper GI (barium swallow). One doctor thinks the sphincter in my lower esophagus doesn't properly shut, but none of the results from my tests supported this. After two years of testing and medication that failed my family gave up.\n  \nTo this day I spit up. I'm concerned about my entire esophagus being exposed to so much stomach acid. I absolutely hate that this happens. It's embarrassing, it's repulsive, and I know it's destroying my body.  \n  \nIs this a side effect brought about by the abuse? If not, what might it be?\nTL;DR:"}

The first time it became an issue is when we had a Skype date planned in advance and she bailed to go to his house and babysit him because he dropped acid and called her because he had nobody there to take care of him in case it went bad.\n\nThe second issue was when she was there at a party and \"had a moment\" with his roommate. She promises me this consisted of just a long hug, and I believe her. Nevertheless, I considered it bordering on emotional/physical cheating as I have never met this guy. \n\nShe has been up front about both of these occurrences,  I never had to drag anything out of her, although I did have to spend a little time explaining why they are such a big deal to me.\n\nShe's gone over a couple times since those incidents and we've fought about it each time. She decided to go over there this week some time and we had our worst falling out yet about it.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Stupid question about asking a girl out\nPOST: I'm gonna get right to the point. First, some background info: I'm 20, and I've always been kind of a loner. I'm your usual, stereotypical Redditor, to be honest. This year I've been postponing university to take up a few subjects from high school in order to get into the degree of my choice, and most of my friends have moved to other cities or abroad. So, as you see, I don't have too much going on in terms of social life at the moment. It might be worth mentioning I'm from a Scandinavian country.\n\nEver since I entered high school I've been kicking myself for not keeping in touch with a girl I went to school with for a year before then. We were 16 at the time; our school systems are somewhat different than in the US. We hung out every now and then, and went to our \"prom\" together, but only as friends. Had I asked her out when I knew her, I probably wouldn't be in this predicament. But since I didn't, I've always kicked myself for not doing it. She's very intelligent and pretty, and kind of shy.\n\nNow 4 years have passed. My question is; would it be weird to ask her to coffee or something through Facebook? I know she attends the university I'll be at from January, so I guess I can use that as a pretext. In my (probably warped) mind, it would be immediately obvious to her that I'm a loser \u2013 and possibly a stalker \u2013 with no real social life, and thus she wouldn't be interested in the least. I mean, she can just look at my all too revealing Facebook profile. I have no experience with the \"dating scene\" (although I'm not totally inexperienced with girls).\n\nI realize I'm over thinking things to the point of absurdity. Please show compassion and treat me as a sort of retard with no understanding of human interaction.\nTL;DR:"}

I've never tried cyber sex, or anything like that, but as time goes by I'm feeling more prone to give it a try.

I have found a nice house shared with a couple listed at $985/month, all inclusive. This house is much nicer and the housemates are very similar to me in terms of expectations. It would require me to commute 25 minutes to school so that adds on $108 monthly for transit costs.\n\nIf I moved, it would require me to find someone to sublet my current room immediately. I am wondering if this would be a smart move for me, from a financial and well being point of view. My roommates are not bad people per se, we just have different standards on cleanliness and sharing household items. I am trying to negotiate down the price of the new home. I am also wondering if I am able to sublet my current room at a rate higher than what I am paying? I gave my landlord pre-dated cheques so any subletter I find would be paying me directly.\nTL;DR:"}

But then I'll still be 60 and waiting for something so happen so I'm so torn!\nTL;DR:"}

(26/29)\nPOST: We've been together for 4 years , living together for 3. She lives in the house I bought right before we met and everything  is \"ours\". We meshed everything pretty easily and quickly as we've known each other for a long time (since middle school)  and committed quickly.  \n\nWe're getting married on the 19th for formalities. We just came to a casual, logical agreement that it was time a few weeks ago. Both of us have pretty strange/crazy families and we want to be protected legally if anything happens to the other. More importantly, we're getting married because we plan to stick with each other forevs . We're taking a half day and going to the courthouse before work, very nonformal. However, I still feel like it's a pretty huge step,  considering the social and legal implications of marriage.\n\nShe thinks it's just a necessary evil and really doesn't seem to attach sentimental feelings for it.  This bums me out. I'm excited to tell friends and family. She figures they know we might as well be married so what's the difference if we are? \n\nWe've talked about it and have agreed to disagree. I'm designing announcements while she is pretty much indifferent,  though she does say and act like she wants to stick with me for the long run. I feel like a reverse stereotype and I don't know if I should see this as a red flag.  \n\nIs indifference  to the formality of marriage something to worry about if everything else is fine? I am thinking that it doesn't matter  but I kind of wish she'd show some excitement about it.\nTL;DR:"}

I try talking to girls i would be interesting in dating or at least becoming close with, but I can never get attracted to them because I always seem to compare them to Rita. When I start to talk to a new girl, my mind instantly goes to Rita and how the new person compares to her. \n\n    This seems hard to understand, so I will give you the latest example. I tried talking to this girl a while ago. We flirted in class and i said i would call her later that night. I did, and while on the phone, I realized that I like talking to Rita more than I like talking to this new girl. Little things like that are what have been really turning me off to every god damn new girl i meet. I need help Reddit. How do I stop comparing everyone to Rita?\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I have been dating since we were about 16 and have had an amazing past few years. He's perfect in the generic boyfriend way: kind, funny, tall, handsome, and my family loves him. But for the past three years I've been away at college, close enough to visit, and he's been at home at a JC. He'll be transferring soon and I'm not sure I want to wait for this.\n\nI will have been graduated for at least two years before he would even think about graduating. I want to go and live my life for myself and not have to wait around for him to finish as well. I should probably point out, I've grown extremely dependent on him. I don't really have a lot of friends because so much of my social life as a teenager revolved around him. The friends I do have are all in relationships as well or are friends from my childhood. The people we hang out with the most is his friends and I've grown extremely close to all of them as well.\n\nOverall, I feel we've become to comfortable in being a relationship that the both of us feel like we should stay to together just because it's too hard to imagine our lives without each other. I just need help figuring out what's best for us here. And if breaking up is the best, how to make it as painless as possible for the both of us?\nTL;DR:"}

I have tried the uberman and dymaxion sleep scheadules with little luck and frankly am less excited about them because of the inflexibility in sleep times.  Everyman seems like the next logical choice for my goals and I very well might try it.  I would be tempted to do something slightly different though and would like reddits input.  \n\nBasically I would take as many naps as I damn well please but never let them extend longer than 30 minutes as to force my body to kick into REM sooner.  I would take them whenever tired but always make sure I was fully awake again before dipping into the next nap.  Hopefully I naturally would not need as much total sleep as my normal 8 hours, but cutting the sleeping hours is not the key aspect.  Most importantly I want to be the same happy and creative person as always but have more lucid and otherwise dreams to play with.\n\nHas anyone tried a similar sleep schedule?

It used to be at the point where she would tell me that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, and it made me happy instead of creeped out. This was also extremely characteristic of her, because she is the most fiercely independent person I've ever met.\nShe never showed emotions like normal people, and as a result I accused her for not caring about me. She'd get extremely annoyed if I showed any sign of clinginess, hated PDA, etc. Whenever I tried to get her to show affection she got very angry that I was trying to change her. Most of our fights were small and centered on those issues.\nOur last fight was because of us not speaking for two days because she refused to text me first, and I was trying to give her space and not be clingy. Just a giant misunderstanding. But the result was her getting drunk, dumping me over a text message, and then later on when she sobered up telling me that she didn't love me anymore the same way and that nothing I can do or say will change her mind.\nI of course make a complete pathetic ass out of myself and begged her to give me another chance and broke down multiple times. Obviously I can't take that back, so I really need your help with what to do next. Before anyone says she's not worth it, she really is. She's the one.

That's all fine, but it affects my boyfriend. They do not help him with things he actually really needs, and keep buying him stuff that, although 'cool', are just to show off and apparently buy their children's affection, to show they are so cool and hip.

But they are going to be part of my family, and I can not stand their perspectives in life. They are a pair of inconsequent adolescents.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [22M] boyfriend is not going to be in town for my birthday. Should I [22F] go out of my way to be with him on Xmas?\nPOST: My bf and I have been dating for about 8 months. We have not seen each other since about November 23rd. I live 8 hours away from where we live now and I went down to see my family for Thanksgiving. He left on December 1 for a work thing and has been going to some cool countries. His boss said that he could pick the last country and travel there for leisure. He chose to be there for four days and get back Dec 19\u2014the day after my birthday. Obviously, I was perfectly fine with this because it's a once in a lifetime opportunity for him and we can celebrate later. \n\nI'm going to be 8 hours away from where we live on Dec 19 (the day he gets home from the trip). We will not have seen each other for a month. Right now, I don't know if I should drive up the 8 hours to see him right when he gets back. If I did that, the plan would be to drive an additional 3 hours north to spend Christmas with his family. I don't celebrate Christmas, so being with my family that day is not a big deal to me. However, two things- 1.) my sister gets back on the 21st from being abroad and I miss her and 2.) my family has a really fun event planned for Christmas day. \n\nSo now I'm conflicted. Normally, I would feel guilty about not spending Christmas with my bf since he celebrates it, but since he's missing my birthday when he technically didn't have to, I'm not sure I want to drive the 11 hours (8 up to where we live plus three additional to get to his family's house) to spend Xmas day with him. If I didn't, I would just come up on the 26th and not see him for an additional week which, when it's only been 8 months is a long time!! I really don't know what I should do. Should I go up early because we haven't seen each other in so long? Help!\nTL;DR:"}

He made this decision without talking to me to see how I felt about it. I know we haven't been dating for great amount of time but it still bothers me. He is leaving in a few short months for I don't know how long. I wanted to follow him eventually but he's reluctant to have me go. He's moving there because he wants to better his life. \nI feel like he doesn't have true feelings for me. When I ask, he gets upset and says I'm being a drama queen.

When we aren't together, he can be a real asshole to me over social media and in front of my old coworkers when we get together. \nI don't know what to do or how to feel.

A few times we got really high and ended up sleeping together. He would always feel bad and apologize.

We met each other at an orientation back in June. During this time we were both in a committed relationship and both were happy. Over the summer I forgot about her and my girlfriend at the time of 3 and a half years broke up with me 2 weeks before college started and i was blindsided and devastated.\n\nGoing into the school year I knew one person going to this college so i felt really alone. On the first day of school Rita saw me and recognized me and we exchanged numbers and started hanging out basically every day. We became almost inseparable. She was still in her relationship and I knew that and totally respected that. She would come to me for advice or anything and everything was great. We became best friends and we talked about everything and anything.\n\nI started having feelings for her as I started growing closer to her but over christmas break I realized that i should keep my distance because she was still in a relationship. So i backed off and we didn't talk that much over break. Into this semester we were very distant, and didn't talk or hang out at all. Only hanging out twice and talking maybe once a week this semester. Just last week she told me they broke up and she's devastated. Because of this we started hanging out and talking more and told her I'll always be here for her and she knows that. \n\nSo my question is how do I approach this? I still have feelings for her but I have no clue if she does for me. We are nearly identical in personalities and interests along with the same values. She's smart, pretty and funny. But she's also my best friend and I'm afraid of losing my best friend if i make an advance at her.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by miscalculating my calories\nPOST: FYI: English is not my native language - sorry in advance\n\n4 months back I decided to get on a diet, and wanted to make my own, as I have successfully done that in the past. The goal was to lose weight with a strict diet that would allow me to lose about 0.5 kg each week. This would for me, be eating 2000 calories a day. \n\nI got on this website where you can put in specific foods from specific companies, so you know the calories should be correct. I added and took away a lot of foods before I finally was done. \n\nIn the beginning I was generally pissed off and in a bad mood all the time. I went to bed out of exhaustion around 20:30-21:00 and slept for 10-11 hours every night. I didn't think much of it, and knew it was hard cutting from previous experiences.\n\nIn my 2nd month I started to get depressed and preferred to be alone in my room watching movies and playing games after work and gym, also in the weekends.\n\n3 months later I got really depressed, but decided it was worth sticking to the diet because of the end result I was going to get. I was constantly craving food and was tired all the time. When at the gym, I became dizzy after lifting for a few minutes, and at the end of the month I ended up puking in the bathroom at the gym. \n\nNow, 4 months later, I checked the scale and had lost over 11 kg in 4 months (I should've only lost half the weight by now). I triple-checked to make sure it was right, and it was indeed correct. I go back on the diet website and check my meal-plan. I realize an enormous FU, I forgot to take away 3 WHOLE AVOCADOS, which makes up about 1000 calories. I was basically starving my self without knowing it for almost 4 whole months, but I did lose a lot of weight though. Anyway, I am now back to bulking. \n\nI know I'm a stupid fuck for not checking earlier, and I always felt something was a little off, but thought I just had to adjust. Still, I'm stupid as hell and will be triple-checking my future diets before starting.\nTL;DR:"}

So i wait outside in the blazing heat until a student comes by and can swipe me in. I prefer the stairs to elevators as usual so I climb 4 flights. Now I was a bit out of shape and had long hair and a beard at the time. So I get to his hallway and i'm dripping sweat. Here is where i completely fuck up. I turn the corner and a HB8 is standing at his adjacent door looking at some shit. I think \"good I don't need to interact with her shes clearly waiting for the other door to open.\" So i proceed to knock on my boys door. She turns and says, \"Why are you here?\" I think wtf is she talking to me for.. I say, \"Gotta get the trees.\" She then stands directly parallel to me and stares at me. I proceed to stare back at her. I thought maybe i just told an RA I was getting marijuana or something. So we hold eye contact for 30 seconds then a massive smile breaks onto my face. She can't stop smiling either then she starts laughing hysterically. So I am standing there thinking \"Is this girl fucking insane?\" My dealer opens the door to an awkward scenario that I can't fully grasp at the time. He invites us both in? Its mad awkward in the room while we get our bud. I don't speak to her but you can tell there is sexual tension in the room. Well looking back on it I can.

They seated us outside in a patio-ish area (when there were a bunch of open tables inside the restaurant) and it was rather cold out. My grandmother asked if we could be seated inside because 1) it was cold and she gets sick extremely easily and 2) she likes to get pampered a bit at restaurants.

Recently, one of the girls of this group and I hooked up--and it was mutually a really great experience. We both had gotten out of bad relationships recently (mine was a 4yr, over 4months ago, hers was a few months long and ended a few weeks ago). She had just dumped a guy who was a bi-polar alcoholic, and she knew it wasn't doing her any good, so she left him. (She met him on one of his 'Highs' and really fell for that side of him.) He's since been on a bender, pouring his heart out to her and begging for her to take him back--saying he'll change, that he'll be better, but he's been doing it very immaturely: insulting her, threatening her...though it's clear he's just being dramatic. \n\nEither way, I care about this girl, and don't want to see her get caught in his emotional web. She believes that she has unfairly given up on him, and feels that she cannot abandon him like everyone else has in his life. When telling her that it's not her responsibility to take care of this boy, she notes that that is what everyone else has said, and that she's not going to be like that, and wants to help him.\n\nWhat can I say that is sensitive to her position, but helpful to let her see that this is a toxic relationship and that it's in her best interest to leave him.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22 M] and my GF [24 F] have been together 4 great years but I suspect she was lying about being a virgin.\nPOST: When we first started dating, we both disclosed that we were virgins at the time (we no longer are). She was with her ex for 3 years and he broke up with her to pursue men. He is gay/bi or something. \n\nRecently she told me about a guy she works with jokingly called her a slut. She told me that she said to him, \"How am I a slut, I haven't even slept with that many people\". But as far as I know, she has only slept with me. I know she regrets everything in her past relationship with her ex, and that she could be trying to erase that part of her life. But I really think I should know if she was a virgin or not.\n\nIs it wrong that I feel like she could be lying to me? Am I wrong for think of not trusting her? I have contemplated making a fake facebook account and messaging her ex and straight up asking if he has ever had sex with a girl before. But when I think about doing that, I feel like a horrible person that i don't trust her. I would rather have a 3rd party person contact them and try to get the answer out of them. Because I can't be a bad person. I love my girlfriend very much. But this isn't the first time she has lied about something big like this about her past relationship. She told me she had never done anal, but then a year into our relationship she admitted that she actually did try it and just really regretted it.\nTL;DR:"}

We've had quite a few major arguments where we both said things we regretted. We clearly need to work on our communication, as most of our fights boil down to that.\n\nFor the most part I try to communicate my wants/needs (maybe a little too often) but I often feel like he doesn't take them seriously. And I feel like he doesn't feel comfortable opening up to me about his own wants. And then sometimes when we try to communicate we fight. It's also worth noting this is both of our first, long-term relationship, so we don't have the most experience in the communication department. So how can we properly communicate?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by lying to a heartbroken, scared mother for no reason\nPOST: This fuck up was approximately two weeks ago. I was in Philadelphia visiting colleges with, my mom and my sister, as I was a high school senior. After the long winded presentation/tour at Drexel and Temple really made me and my family hungry. We went to eat.\n\nFinally, we decided that it is time to head back to the big train station in Philly and board a train back home. My bladder, however, was about to explode. I excuse myself to go use the bathroom. I ask an employee where the nearest restroom is and he directs me to it. On my approach, I see a kid, around 9 or 10, with a Phillies hat run past me with a panicked look on his face. I think practically nothing of it and go to use the bathroom. My urination went normally but as I walk out, I see a lady run toward me. She asks in a hurried breath if I had seen her son. She goes on to describe him to be exactly the kid I had seen. For no reason whatsoever I said calmly \"no\" and treated her like she was bothering me. Right after as she thanked me and sprinted away, I knew I fucked up. I tried to run after her but I had lost her in the crowded train station. I returned to my mom and sister and was empty for the rest of the day.\n\nIn hindsight, I don't think me mentioning that I had seen the kid a couple of minutes before would have practically helped the mother find him, but I still can't stand that I said no. I can only hope that they found each other but I have no way of checking. My answer haunts me to this day and sometimes I cannot get it out of my head.\nTL;DR:"}

The last project I did, did not go as planed, and I ended up doing most of the work alone, despite having a different agreement with my friends, so I was a bit annoyed.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/jobs\nTITLE: Intern in need for help: What should I do?\nPOST: So, this is the story:\nOn the last days of April I started an internship on a certain magazine (let's say Time Out Mexico, though it might or might not be that one). The teacher who got me the interview, as well as the editor who I was gonna do work for, both mentioned it was a 3 month internship or test period before getting a more \"real\" position on the magazine (and thus, a pay to go with it), so I accepted keeping that in mind and as a goal of my work there (apart from all the experience, of course).\nThis morning I met with my editor to discuss my future on such magazine, and the person mentioned that the interns actually have had a 6 months to a year trial period (instead of the 3 months that was first discussed) and that they weren't able to do anything for me right now, even if they were looking forward to hire me in another three months for a more formal position, as well as saying how satisfied and happy was with my work and all that kinds of praises. \nAfter spending the day thinking about it, I feel kind of discouraged about the reaction and I feel like I've been lied to, up to the point where instead of keeping my intern job I feel like just quitting for good. I've been thinking of sending an e-mail (since it's easier for me) to my editor, telling this person about such feelings and how I think I've been cheated on with the time change, though I don't really know what's my position on this and since this is my first job, I figured I might ask for your help on this one.\nAs I mentioned, one of the reasons I even started with the internship was the fact of getting paid (after three months they said) and I don't really feel motivated to keep doing this for three more months, since it's not really profitable for me at all (mostly because I'm paying for everything). What can I do to express my feelings to the editor, keep my job and get paid? What's the limit I shouldn't surpass when expressing this feelings? Can I express my resentment to their lie (because that's what I was) about this internship?\nOnce more, thank you all?\n(\nTL;DR:"}

The voices were of two friends of mine, Kremson and Liv. They were walking beside my friend Catherine, who was smiling, laughing, and looking just a little bit embarrassed. Kremson says,\"Sean, Catherine has something to ask you! About the dance!\" They look at her expectantly, with smiles on their faces. She, through a bit of embarrassment and an adorable smile, asks,\"Sean, do you want to go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance?\" (It is a dance where boys are invited by girls. I have my school to thank for that). Of course, seeing as how I'm interested, I say,\"I would love to!\" Liv and Kremson make celebratory noises, Catherine still looks happy and slightly embarrassed and I feel like the man. \n\nSo, my next class was Pre-calculus, and Kremson is in that class. I ask Kremson,\"What the hell prompted all of that?\" She tells me that they were talking about who they wanted to take to the dance. Catherine had said that she was unsure of whom she wanted to take. So, as people do, they started naming names, trying to get an answer out of her. \"Reese?\" \"No.\" \"Sean?\" *laughing*. \"SEAN! SEAN!\" Our story comes full circle.\n\nMany questions arise from this:\n\n1. Did she actually intend to ask me, or was it a spur of the moment thing, where she felt put on by her friends?\n\n2.

It's like she wants to bring the best out of me and we share a lot of same interest in things. Also the way she smiles at me never had that with someone else.

About 6 feet past the front door, with no one insight, I immediately assume no one had let him in. So I start to question him. It went a little something like this, \nMe: \"Hey...\" \nHim: \"Hi, how's it going?\" \nMe: \"Yeah I'm good...\"\nHim: \"I'm here to fix the car\" (Now, I had no fucking clue my dad's gf's car was fucked) \nMe: \"What?

English is not my native language but I think I'm doing alright with the language barrier. My problem is that I'm really shy and I have quite a bit of anxiety. Well I've been shy as long as I can remember and now, finally, I've really had enough.\n\nI'm not completely hopeless though. I don't have the best people skills but I have no problem talking to my friends or often meeting new people if I can relate to them in any way. Especially with a little help from alcohol.\n\nHowever there's something about doing something for the first time or talking to someone for the first time, specifically if I'm alone. This is a bit ironic since I'm very disorganised and I enjoy a bit of chaos. Simple stuff like going to a restaurant that I've never been to or going to the council to sort something out can really fire up my anxiety. Telephones also seem to scare the shit out of me if I don't know who's on the other end.\n\nI know the best way to deal with this is probably getting a shrink or take some anti-anxiety drugs. Since I'm a penniless student and not at home in this country that's not very easy for me to do. I can't live like this anymore, I'm studying to be a musician and this is always going to hold me back.

The big day was set for the upcoming weekend.\n\nA couple days prior to the big day, I had a hockey game and went over to her house after. The story begins when I forgot a change of underwear. I shower up after my game and since I didn't bring a change of underwear, I had to go commando in jeans to her house.\n\nSo I get to her house and we begin to watch a movie in the basement, things start to heat up a bit as we start making out. We start dry humping the hell out of each other while we're making out. As she gets on top of me, I get this weird feeling on my donger that is not very pleasant. But like most horny teenagers I don't let it get to me and continue on. I'm leaving her house later that night and its quite uncomfortable to walk. I get into my car, turn the light on and take a look at what's wrong with my dick. Why does it hurt so bad? Turns out, the combination of dry humping, and wearing no underwear under jeans gave me 3 different spots of rug burn (jean burn? I dont know..). The first thing on my mind was oh shit.. I'm supposed to be finally getting laid in a couple days.. whats gonna happen.. aww shit. \n\nFast forward to the big day. Burns still present and painful as ever. We're at her house, start off by making out in the hot tub and the pool. Hurry off to the shower to rinse off the chlorine in our horny stupor. We're in the shower and starts to jerk me off, thankfully she hasn't seen the burns on my dick. If you've ever irritated a rug burn on your arm, multiply that by 50 and that's how I felt. Shortly after, we head off to the bedroom where I slip on a condom and hope to god the sex doesn't hurt (for me atleast). Praise be to those condoms... no pain on my end, and the girlfriend never knew I had the rug burns\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 33 and he is 29. We are both well-educated, have good jobs, and do well enough financially that money would not be a major issue/stressor. \n\nNeither of us have much experience with babies or kids. I am an only child, and he is the youngest of two.  We probably have no idea what we are getting ourselves into.\n\nWhen we got married last year, we both felt open to having kids, but it was not a major deal breaker for us.  Over time, my husband has developed a much deeper urge to have a child. I have not. \n\nI'm really not against having children, but I just don't have a pull towards having one. I don't dislike kids when I have been around them, which has been very little, but I've not loved it either. I just feel deep ambivalence. I've kept waiting to have a strong feeling about having kids or not, but at this point I am not sure I ever will. \n\nBut feeling this way has me upset about trying to have kids.  I am not sure it is right for me to try to have children when I am not that excited about having them. As we have been getting into baby making, I've just gotten more fearful. What if my ambivalence doesn't go away when I get pregnant or when I have a kid?  \n\nDoes anyone have any experience having kids after being not that into the idea of having them?  Do you think it is likely I'd get more into the idea once I have given birth? I don't want to have children and really end up resenting being a mother.\n\nNOTE: Due to several factors, I would be the primary care giver.  My husband's earning potential is much higher than mine, so even though he would be more excited about a baby, it would make much more sense for me to take the lead on kid related stuff.\nTL;DR:"}

I have this overbearing feeling that my girlfriend is going to leave me for somebody else and is just biding time. She's been talking to a mutual friend (my friend for over 3 years) pretty heavily. I *think* I saw her text him something intimate, in the form of an I love you or I miss you, not sure. She's been rather protective of their conversations. Now she's attacking me (verbally) for being paranoid, which yes I am concerned, who wouldn't be if they saw something like that?  Then the other day, I show up at her job to surprise her with lunch so she doesn't have to eat fast food. I see his car parked next to hers. I got out and ran into her, didn't see him he may have been in his car. I asked her about it, she got defensive and mad that I even questioned why he was there. She told me to leave, I just gave her the food and left. Now I'm torn between two feelings; scared I'm going to be dumped or scared I'm paranoid and pushing us apart. I haven't done anything crazy like stalking or snooping into facebook, phones, etc. But the temptation is there. I don't want to be a creep but I don't want to let my guard down and be hurt. Sounds like I have trust issues but I just need some advice. What should I do? I've been in love with her longer than we've been together. She's the only person that completely understands me (until recently I guess). Should I just shut the f*** up and live normal, or should I prepare for the worst?\nTL;DR:"}

He introduced me to her a few months ago and we got along pretty well. Saw her a few more times at dinners and the like with my friend, so I added her on Facebook. She immediately accepted and messaged me how she was happy we were now fb friends. We didn't really message much until she started asking me questions about my friend/her bf. I made sure not to say too much and kept to the message that he's a cool guy and she should ask him directly.  \nThen one day she tells me my friend lied to her, she's mad at him, starts asking me if I think he really likes her - I avoid responding directly and she realizes she shouldn't really be taking to me about these things. Fast forward to a few weeks later, she texts me (not fb) despite me never having given her my number. She says she's out shopping with my friend and she's bored and would I please come join them. I decline despite her insisting, but then text my friend and he invites me to join them for dinner so I do.  \n\nIt comes up in conversation that I have a celebrity crush on a particular actress. She says she also loves said actress. A few days later she texts me and asks why I like this actress - looks, personality? I say a bit of both. Then she says \"well don't you think I'm kind of like that actress? We have the same hair and eye color and are about the same height, and I think our personalities are similar. Do you think that's your type of girl?\" I respond kind of vaguely and changed the subject.  \n\nShe also has taken a habit of sometimes talking to me about emotional issues at work and with her family. \n\nFinally I should mention that she does seem to really be into my friend. She does act really friendly towards me but maybe she's just like that with everyone? I didn't think she was being flirty until that bit with the actress.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: If the hospital I went to messed up my hand, what should I do?\nPOST: Back in March I broke my left middle finger(dog accident), and I had to keep it in a buddy-tape with my index finger. The nurse who did it forgot to put something between them, so the skin rubbed off between the fingers, and the bone didn't heal at all. This left my middle finger still bent, and the skin had rubbed entirely off around the joint, and was rotting.\n\nI got a surgery in April to get screws(which I've recently learned can be taken out a year or so after the operation), and I'm still doing exercises to ensure that I can bend it fully. It has some permanent nerve damage around the incision, and having the stitches removed was so painful that the hand specialist who performed the surgery said that some people pass out from the pain.\n\nIt took me quite some time just to be able to bend it somewhat like the other fingers, and I've managed to bend it fully since about a week ago. All of this could have been avoided if the original nurse had correctly put my finger in a buddy-tape. I also learned that I was not the first person that this happened too(one of my closest friends went through the same malarky).\n\nWhat I'm asking is whether or not I should attempt to sue them?

Our original plan was to get tested for STDs and then we could have sex without a condom (we did this beforehand and it felt so good). We both came back clean; however, she got something called Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) which had her freaking out a bit...even though it isn't an STI. She took her course of meds and is fine now. Now she is saying she always wants to have sex with a condom.\n\nI realize it kind of seems like a minor issue on initial glance, but being fresh out of a serious LTR, I'm not sure if she is being sincere by this or if this is an early battle for control on her part. She has always said she doesn't respect guys that let her walk all over them. Part of me thinks she's acting way too paranoid because, from what I know, you can still get BV even with a condom on. I know she tends to worry too much about the smaller things...which is good in someways because I know she appreciates the little things and its harder to take me for granted...but this is kind of a little much.

Lately he's recovering and keeps saying that we will be better.\nwhich brings me to this day. we had our first big fight and he screamed at me to leave him. it started with me ranting at him for his shortcomings.. he doesnt have a job, we don't have sex and i'm starting to feel insecure. i feel that ive been waiting for him for so long that i can't get any satisfaction anymore. im losing patience. \nam i being selfish? what should i do?\nTL;DR:"}

We met each other this past year in grad school and spend a significant amount of time together everyday. We get along great, and he puts me in a good mood every time I'm with him. We have yet to get in a fight and everything really has gone so effortlessly (saying I love you, meeting each other's families, exchanging keys). \n\nMy college boyfriend (23 M) of 3 years and I fought all the time. We pretty much had this consistent tension but I think that was more so just the way we meshed together. Also, he never wanted to talk about the future until I was in the midst of breaking up with him. Im experiencing the complete opposite with my current boyfriend and am finding myself unexpectedly head over heels. Are we still in the honeymoon phase or have I just hit the jackpot?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Is there more to life than the \"American Dream\"?\nPOST: I'm feeling a little lost and could use some advise. A little back history: My SO and I have been together for about 7 years, he's 30 & I'm 26. We moved away from our families early on in our relationship in order to pursue an education and career. We actually have been very successful, he earned his bachelors degree and I only have a couple years left until I complete mine. We have a house in the suburbs (no children) and have careers where we make enough money to be comfortable. We originally set out to accomplish all the things that we associated with being successful and we have reached our original goal relatively earlier than we expected to. It all sounds great and like we should be happy, but we've both realized recently we're both really unhappy. We have even evenly started questioning our relationship, which I previously thought was rock solid.\nThe problem is we don't know what about our current situation is making us unhappy and how to even begin figuring out what needs to change. The corporate grind is soul sucking and having a house makes me feel more trapped than successful. The previous goal was to eventually open our own business one day. But after working for smal companies, that's not all its cut out to be either, you still spend the majority of your time working. And it's not like you can just not work, people need at least some money to survive. I've been broke before and that's very stressful and not a fun life. So what else is there?\n\nSo my first question: is life just like this? Is the majority of life just spent working and generally crappy? and the only really happiness is the occasions in between work and sleep when you get to do what you want? If so, are there ways to try to maximize the amount of time you get doing what you want?\n\nSecond question: if there is more to life, how do you start figuring out what it is that needs changed in your life? How do you determine what it is that will make you happier?\nTL;DR:"}

One of her best friends is a man about ten years older than we are whose wife passed away two years ago and they have known each other for about a year now. It seems like it really messed him up and he doesn't quite have it all together yet. He's also very openly in love with my girlfriend. There are a few things about this that make me uncomfortable:\n\n* She told me that she has turned him down, but he persists.\n* Any time he knows I will going to a social gathering, he doesn't show up.\n* My girlfriends finances are a mess right now, and he has stepped in to help her a couple times since I've known her. They took a vacation together right around the time I met her, which I'm sure he paid for.\n* They see each other about as often as I see her during the week, and she seems to call him first when she is emotional about something.\n\nShe tells me that she is not romantically interested in him, and I believe her. What it seems like to me is that this guy hasn't gotten over his emotional issues and is overly invested in an unavailable woman, and she benefits comfortably from it. I truly don't think she's cheating on me, but he is a disruptive force in our relationship and it's hard not *feel* like she's dating both of us.\nTL;DR:"}

She's posing as a different person.\nPOST: Okay so, this actually happened a few months ago but I've been feeling pretty disturbed since this discovery.\n\nI was borrowing my mom's laptop one day because mine was being fixed at the time. I went to type in the address of a social media site I frequent and there in the drop down, a few links to this site to a profile. Me being curious and perhaps a bit naive, I clicked on the link and it brought me to this person's profile. I read through it a bit and realized the interests and what not were extremely similar to my mom's, but the profile didn't add up. A male from a city we aren't from, much younger, and from a different background. Also listed was 'interested in women'. I realized that this was most likely a fake account my mom is using. My head was spinning at this point and I didn't know what to make of it all, so I just closed out of the page and visited facebook, etc. then returned the laptop to my mom later. However, I forgot to delete those page visits from her browser history.\n\nI used her laptop for something maybe a few days to a week after that incident and realized that she had gone 'incognito' on her browser, which means it's highly possible she knows that I know.\n\nI'm trying not to add too much info regarding this because I know she browses Reddit occasionally. I just feel sick to my stomach whenever I think about this. I know she loves her family to death and she loves my dad. I just don't understand why she'd be posing as a completely different, single person. I have no idea if I'm overreacting or if I'm right to be concerned. Also I'm sorry if I left some info out, I'm just desperate for advice at this point.\nTL;DR:"}

I [22/M] broke up with my Girlfriend [21/F].\n\nAlthough I truly care for her very deeply, she's just too busy with work, school and volunteering and I was tired of being pushed aside. Every time I'd try to make plans, it was always one reason or another why she couldn't make it. And more and more it just seems like she was losing interest.\n\nUsually this would be pretty cut and dry, but she got really emotional when I ended things with her and she left quickly without saying anything. I told her that our schedules just weren't compatible anymore and that we should have some space. I also made sure to tell her that I still liked her and cared for her very deeply\u2014which is no word of a lie. If she was so emotional, why didn't she prove this when she had the chance in our relationship? I really want things to work between us and I do want to reach out to her, but I think it would best to stick with my guns on this one.\n\nI guess if someone truly likes you, they will find a way to make it work.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I [F/30s] need some advice on how to communicate with my partner [M/30s, together 2.5 years] about my depression\nPOST: He's a pretty \"regular\" guy.  He likes cars, he is a news junky, he likes to hang and have beers with his bros, he doesn't express his emotions verbally very well and doesn't have much exposure to the sort of deep introspection and psychological (pop and otherwise) thinking that we Redditor-types seem to really like.  Since English is not his first (or even his second) language and he is a theoretical physicist I feel lucky that he is as verbally expressive as he is.  Which is not to say the physicists are unfeeling jerks, just that he hasn't really been trained to express himself verbally, either orally or written, and he does fall a bit into the robotic/emotions-confuse-me stereotype.\n\nSo, having a girlfriend in a depressive episode is pretty terra incognita for this guy and having long conversations about how he feels about it hits a wall pretty quickly.  Since he is not going to go out and read every book and article about depression and having a depressed partner, I need to sort of guide him through this.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is mostly (I think) a reactive depression due to multiple external stressors, not just something that is happening to me out of the blue.  Most of the issues in my life have nothing to do with my partner or our relationship (family, health, and work-related, mostly), but some do.  I don't really want to work on that relationship stuff with him right now because I am unable to distinguish what are \"real\" problems and what only seem like problems when perceived through the depression.  Plus, I am not really excelling these days at taking constructive criticism.  I am seeing both a psychologist for psychodynamic therapy (which works well for me) and a psychiatrist to start medication next week.\n\nThis being Reddit, I imagine that quite a few of you have been through a depressive episode with a partner (depressive types seem to gravitate here).

After about 20 minutes I rung him back to find out what was happening. When I ask whats up his words were 'my parents know' at first I went silent and then I asked what he was talking about. Turns out his parents found a condom wrapper on his bedroom floor. I was freaking out about it all as I thought my parents were going to find out. Next time I went over there I felt very awkward.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Auto Mechanic performed maintenance that may have directly caused a large engine failure without my consent.\nPOST: Hello- \n\nMy residence is Minnesota. I purchased a car that had a check engine light on. Before I purchased the car, I requested the check engine light be diagnosed and repaired. The dealer I purchased from used an import mechanic shop in my area. Since then I have had multiple check engine lights on my car and have taken to the shop in hopes of the repair being covered by warranty. Each time (5 separate times) the mechanic has diagnosed something different and I have been charged around 2,500 for different work, several times the mechanic performed the work without my verbal consent and has been very dodgy about responding to emails and voice mails. The most recent repair the mechanic applied an engine tune to my car that was \"better than my current engine tune \"(my car had an entry level racing tune) without my consent. My car's check engine light went on again and I went to another mechanic because I was not trusting the work this original mechanic was performing. The mechanic I talked to said that there is a strong chance the engine tune that they applied had broken the turbo charger on my car. The cost of this repair is quoted to be around $2,500. Do I have any remedies available to me to recover the cost of this repair. I have emailed and left voicemails to my original mechanic regarding the tune to inquire if they would replace free of charge. They have not yet responded to these.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (27F) am scared of becoming the jaded, bitter single woman.\nPOST: I've been back on the online dating scene for over a year.  There's been a couple of mediocre hookups but no relationships.  Ideally I'd like a relationship but I'm open to casual sex while I look because, well, I have needs.  \n\nMy problem is that I'm getting increasingly disappointed by my interactions with these guys.  A surprising amount of men who are already in relationships contact me and that has started to make me feel suspicious of everyone else.  I hate that.  I don't want to accuse an innocent guy of being a cheater.  Another overwhelming problem is \"pic collectors\" (guys who say they wanna meet up but don't and continually ask for more pics).  I also am disappointed by the sheer lack of effort.  I mean, even if I say I just want a FWB type of thing, I feel like they forget I'm even human and just bombard me with nonstop graphic sexual talk.  If I say I want a relationship then there's still lack of effort in just making basic conversation.  I try to offer up info about me and ask open ended questions and I get back \"lol yeah\" or \"haha\".  Some accuse me of catfishing and posting fake pics.  Some back out right before meeting.  The most promising prospect I've had was a guy who I really like and told explicitly I wanted a relationship with, but lead me on for months (my fault, I should've ended it sooner).  Each time I start talking to a new guy I try super hard to forget all my past bad experiences so I don't give off a bitter vibe, but still no luck.  I know I need to take a break from online dating but I feel like I wanna be \"available\" to as many people as possible.

He insists on working with our crews of employees but drags everyone down now, is consistently the worst member of the crew. He's forgetting how things have always been done and making strange decisions that make us less productive and frustrate his lower employees. And for those of us in management, he insists he's doing work constantly only to dump unfinished projects in our laps frustrated after they are already overdue. Yet he won't let us just take care of these duties for him for whatever reason. He won't return phone calls or even fill out paperwork to make operations run smoothly, but is frustrated that things aren't going well.\nHe's getting older and I'm concerned that his mental health could be deteriorating. He is often asking me questions to things he taught me years ago.

Relaxing in bed, on the couch with your feet up, as it rains outside and you're warm inside, you feeling cool in an air conditioned living room on a blazing summer day and just being engrossed in a book. The smell of the book and the sound of the pages being turned can almost be ritualistic.\n\nThat being said, the primary act of reading is to enjoy the story. People often complain about not having the time to read when I mention a good book. So a little back story, I had brain surgery 5 years ago and while the results were good I've been left with vision and neck problems (parinauds syndrome and double vision) which makes reading more of a chore than a pleasure. So I turned to audiobooks, I've read over 60 books that I've kept track of (possibly more) on Audible and old school CD based books; books that even with perfect vision and no neck pain I'd never have read. It works great for me, I can 'read' while cooking, cleaning or enjoy it like a normal book and lay back in bed or on the couch, close my eyes and engross myself.\n\nHowever whenever I tell people this I often find myself defending it when they say I cheat.. as if reading is some competition and you only get credit if you physically read the pages.

I have been smitten by her since I first met her. She's pretty and intelligent with a great career. She's also closer to my age (24). We've been talking more lately and it does seem like she's flirting with me. I honestly have no idea if I could have a relationship with her, but she's a nagging presence in my head.\n\nI feel like I can't dedicate the emotional attention that my girlfriend needs with school and work taking up most of my time. I can tell she needs someone that's more emotionally available. \n\nSo, here is my question. Do I stick things out with the current girlfriend or break it off? I feel like a prick for even considering other girls but still have feelings for my current girlfriend. I have suffered from self-doubt in the past over breakups, and I don't want to throw away a good thing for something that doesn't exsist.\nTL;DR:"}

In the middle of our work, one of my team members left to use the rest room and another team member started searching his back pack. Aside from the usual school material he used, he found a bunch of Yugioh Cards, I got one and taped it to the wall, hoping to prank the owner of it. However when he did return he presumed it was another team member who was on a computer working, he instantly tackled him upon seeing it, bringing both of them and the computer as well. He was charged for a new Computer, while I was assigned a After School Detention. In the end not worth it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: My aunt is in a bad marriage and doesn't know what to do.\nPOST: My aunt just moved to the US from South America and married a US citizen (also latino).  They have been married since March of this year. Her now-husband had promised her the moon and the stars back when they were dating while she was still living in South America. Now that they are married, it turns out her husband is nowhere near as good a person as he led her to believe. I've met the husband a couple times and he is actually very manipulative (ie: hid her US immigration documents for a couple weeks, doesn't let her see her sister who is lives nearby, and overall basically hamstrings her from becoming self-sufficient here in America), verbally abusive, and drives drunk with her in the car. She was led to believe that if she got married to him, she would be able to have a better life here in the US. Whenever they get into an argument, he threatens to divorce her so that she doesn't get her documents and will be forced to move back to South America. I am afraid for her life since her husband tends to get drunk and get behind the wheel very often, she has confronted him about that, but he has not changed his ways. I don't know what she can do to get out of the situation and stay in the US. She recently received her work permit, which will expire in a year and residency documents are still being processed. She is currently taking English lessons so she is able to converse in English, but with some difficulty. I'm pretty sure she would be much more fluent in English now if it weren't for the fact that her husband is basically preventing her from going out and immersing herself and learning the language. I've given her advice to actually keep a log of all the threats and abuse she's received from the husband and she is currently doing that. Do you have any advice I can pass along to her? I think she should go back to South America, but I think she at least deserves an opportunity at a better life here.\nTL;DR:"}

This happened about 5 years ago in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nSo while in Japan I had a pretty irrational fear of cockroaches(didn't stay irrational for long). And since I stayed with my grandparents in a small small apartment there were always cockroaches running around and I'd pretty much freak out and jump a little bit when i see one. My mom bought a small rubber cockroach to prank me while I was sleeping. I woke up and saw a freaking huge cockroach on my face and flipped my shit. Then I figured out it was fake and got real pissed. Then for the next few weeks they kept doing this for me and since my natural instincts told me to flip my shit that's what happened pretty much every time... Then one day I wake up in the morning and I see something resting on my chin and I finally had enough of this shit and since my mouth moved a bit it fell into my mouth.... Me being a dumbass and thinking it was fake Just to prove a point I bit the damn thing in half and spat it out. Right away I realized that was not rubber and that in panic I swallowed one half. The other half was squirming on the floor and I proceeded to scream like a girl and run to the bathroom and try to puke that shit out. Wow was I freaking out and my family didn't understand what the hell was wrong with me until I gave up trying to puke and they asked me what was wrong. I then point to the floor where there's a little half cockroach still moving (they still move even when bit in fucking half) and they just start laughing because they're all assholes. I didn't get sick surprisingly or anything and not my irrational fear of cockroaches is multiplied so much and now when I sleep I have to cover my fucking mouth in a bandana or blanket so I feel like I'm not gonna swallow another cockroach and die....\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not into piss/crap/anal/period stuff, but beyond that I like the darker aspects of sensuality. One strong fantasy (that isn't as terrible as some others) is dressing as a man in a suit and having him dress as a girl (but in a way where he still looks masculine) and doing a power-play RP. I have no desire to penetrate him or anything but I like the contrast of sub male (with \"powerful\" sex organ) and dom female (with \"weaker\" sex organ).

Bathroom problems:\n\nSo, this roommate has something going on with her bathroom usage. She's typically in the bathroom for more than an hour and a half every. single. day. \n\nWe have two bathrooms so this isn't too big of a deal, but sometimes in the morning it can be a pain. Also, she constantly leaves the light on in the bathroom - and will leave the toilet running (our toilet has been having issues) ALL DAY.  Seriously, she's cost us about $120 extra on a water bill (combined) because she left the toilet running all night for almost a week straight. \n\n2.) Cleanliness:\n\nThis roommate has been living in the house for almost 9 months, and I have *never* seen her do a round of dishes, vacuum the common area, mow the lawn, etc. This is a pain in the ass, because we're left cleaning up her mess after she has parties and doesn't clean up after her guests. \n\n3) Drugs\n\nThis roommate does cocaine/is smoking something in her room sometimes. We smelled something weird coming from her room one night before she went out with friends, it smelled like burning plastic and we overheard her talking with her friends about doing coke. This isn't cool with the people living in the house, but we are all kinda doing our own thing/non-confrontational, so I don't really know what can be done.\n\nAnyway, I'm hoping you guys could give me some advice on how to deal with a roommate like this. She's kinda nice and I know she is having some personal issues (mom in mental hospital, friends killing themselves), and I'm trying to figure out the best course of action to remedy these problems without making her cry, basically.\nTL;DR:"}

I would beg and cry for my friends to sleep in my room with me because being alone I would just sit up and be paranoid that something was watching me. I had no money for anything because I had no job. I missed my boyfriend more than anything and started being depressed and combative, getting black out drunk at least twice a week.

My first month went great, I got down 6.5 lbs. Then continuing up until gradation in June. I got down to 177 lbs. I was feeling really good! Thinking I could pursue on...I was wrong. My boyfriend proposed in February and I was now thinking of a wedding and making small decisions for it. Well I moved back in with him in June and the same terrible eating habits came back.

He said he feels ashamed and that's why he's not telling me.\n\nIt might be worth mentioning we've been fighting quite a bit over the past few days and both of us have overreacted to things the other has said, but we haven't argued about anything in the past 48 hours or so.\n\nI understand his feeling of shame for not wanting to tell me, but it still hurts knowing that he felt like he could confide in someone else instead of me first. I'm not sure how I can express these feelings or if I even should, or how to go about with this situation. I feel like he doesn't think he can talk to me about things anymore because of our fighting.\nTL;DR:"}

There is nothing scary here. Nothing poisonous.

At the end of the shoe my toe hit something squishy...   \n\"The cat must have been playing with one of my sons socks or something and it ended up in my shoe.\"  A typical occurrence when you have a cat and a 3 year old.     \nNot this time.    \nI reached in to grab whatever it was I had wedged into the toe of my shoe and immediately felt pain in my finger.

Not sure I should pursue a friend [20 F], among other thing\nPOST: Context: Broke up with my first and only girlfriend [20F] of 2.5 years two months ago and have been solo since. She was the first and still the only person I've ever kissed, done anything with etc. Relationship was toxic and put a massive strain between me and family and friends. It went on too long. I had been in this relationship since right before college,  and I wasn't able to develop very close relationships with anybody since I've been at University. \n\nOnly recently started to go out with buddies and drink (I'm a bit of a square) and have a good time. I'm enjoying being able to do what I want when I want. I also have a little bit of social anxiety of sorts, where I can never seem to say the right stuff to people, especially girls I am interested in. Also, I am a fairly reserved and serious person (Alcohol helps this).\n\nAnyway, there's this girl [20 F] who I've been crushing on for a while. Very social, very sociable, she's a sweetheart. We are both athletes (I play football, she swims) at our University,  so we tend to run into each other On a regular basis. I like talking to her, it tends to be a highlight of my day, even for just a little bit. \n\nI take legitmate interest with her, asking about school, swimming, etc, as well as go to her swim meets, but she only reciprocates it spottingly. I fear she sees me as a bit of a creep and only responds to me because she feels bad. I would like to get to know her better, hopefully develop something and go from there, but I'm not sure if it will be worth my time. I also don't know how to break down walls between us to get closer with her. \n\nRationally, I know it may not be worth my energy, but relationships aren't always rational. I turn to reddit because I don't have close friends to talk this out with.\n\nI apologize for the wall of text.\nTL;DR:"}

They went through a stop sign and were hit on the passenger side, where he was sitting. She was driving and sustained some serious injuries, shattering her arm. She's gone into surgery once, but has to go in again tomorrow. He is in ICU and was somewhat crushed in the car. I was told he has sustained alot of internal injuries and some organs have ruptured. He also had to go into surgery and had to have bore holes to combat swelling in his brain from some hemorrhaging. My mother, who told me, said this next 24 hours is the most crucial, essentially deciding his fate (my mother is an RN, and if I'm not mistaken she was an ICU nurse at one point). \nBetween my sister and myself, who is also extremely good friends with them, it is not good. I have no idea what to do as they are 2 hours away. I tried to console my sister, but found myself just sitting in silence for a while, not even sure what to do.

We'll call him Doug. \n\nAbout a year ago, right after I had my daughter, her dad left me. I was very confused &hurt &ended up becoming pretty depressed. I ran into Doug &we began texting here &there, even went out a few times. He seemed very interested in me but with the way I was feeling about myself I couldn't reciprocate the feelings. I couldn't make myself believe this person that I was so attracted to in every way could possibly want something \"pre-used\" &I ended up writing him off completely. \n\nI've finally gotten to a point where I have accepted everything &am feeling better about myself. I have been a lot happier with my life &the direction it is going. A few weeks ago I received a message on Facebook from Doug &my heart went racing. We started talking again &I was excited to be getting a second chance with better timing. We've hung out a couple times &I always enjoy his company.

He's also mentioned he is worried that if we were to enter a relationship, my my cousin would be upset &never talk to him again. \n\nI was a little devastated but I agreed to be just friends. We've continued talking &spending time together. Which might not be helping much because I can't stop thinking about him. He gives me butterflies, I feel so comfortable around him like I don't have to hide anything about myself. I'm almost convinced I should just stay away to avoid myself another heartache. But I'm like a moth &he's the bright light. I wonder if he's worried I'll just write him off like last time &is just being cautious or if I just lost my chance already?

We only dated for around 5 months. It ended because she couldn't reciprocate the same level of affection that I showed and it became apparent we weren't on the same page in the relationship. \n\nI feel like I'm not very emotionally mature because I don't have much experience with relationships and its making me sort of depressed. I don't know how to get passed or over my feelings for her. She clearly does not feel the same way so I'm trying my best to try to leave it in the past. \n\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that I over think a lot of things and often daydream of situations where it works out or sometimes noticing a few red flags before the break up. I also have to deal with a reminder of it daily because we live only a few blocks away from each other and I have to walk passed her street to get to the nearest subway station in my city.\n\nI've tried to meet other people, if only to get over her, but I've discovered I'm not the type for flings.

Only days after we broke up, my best friend made a move and we started a casual sexual relationship. This lasted from December up until late March. I wanted more and he wasn't willing to commit. He said he didn't feel ready for a relationship because he was still not over his previous relationship. I knew that I wasn't either since I also just gotten out of my relationship. I told him I needed time away to try and get over him and we stopped all contact for two months.\n\nIn that time period, I had eventually decided that I would try to forget about him completely, even as a friend. However, we have a mutual best friend and we ended up reconnecting again recently through him.\n\nWe were friendly with each other but there was still a really high level of sexual tension. About a week after we reconnected, he showed up at my house, drunk and asked if he could spend the night because he got ditched at the bar he was drinking at with his friend. I said yes, and of course he made a move and we ended up hooking up.\n\nThis was 3 weeks ago and now we've gone back to hanging out with our mutual best friend regularly. We haven't hooked up again since then though. He's been warmer towards me, and is seeming more kind although he's still flirty. He hasn't at all tried to make a move again though. I feel confused by his actions. Why did he initiate again so quickly? Why is he no longer initiating, and what could all of this mean? I tend to be naive when it comes to these kinds of situations and constantly worry that I am being oblivious.Thank you for helping me make sense of this.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Anyone have multiple, severe, concussion? Q about symptom, not sure if it's related\nPOST: I'm in my late 30's. In my life I recall 3 severe concussions, and at least 4 minors. The first severe one was as a child when I crashed my bike and, as was the norm in the early 80's, didn't have a helmet and smacked my head on the sidewalk. 2nd was as a teen via a kick to the head (the several minor concussions were also at the hands of a violent home life), the final was in 1999 in a very serious car accident.\n\nI've noticed the past few years my memory is getting pretty bad, which the doctors had warned me about. The weird symptom I have now is something I noticed in the years after the accident. I feel the effects of substances ridiculously quick. As in if I drink a beer, I open the bottle, take a swig, enjoy a conversation, take a second swig, and as I swallow I feel my cheeks flush, I get warmer, and I feel buzzed. It passes, it still takes a normal amount of alcohol to get drunk, but I feel the effects almost instantly.\n\nThe same for medicine. If I take a Lunesta (sleep aid) pill when I brush my teeth, I will have trouble getting to the bed without falling over, I learned to have a glass of water and take the pill after lying down. \n\nI'm not saying drugs work instantaneously, like if I take Nyquil my cough and stuffiness isn't cleared up in seconds, but in just seconds I DO feel the \"my brain just detached from my head and I'd floating away\" sensation that other people say they feel about 10 minutes later.\n\nI hope I am explaining this clearly. One of the worst effects of my memory issues is the loss of vocabulary :(. I have talked to several doctors who say they believe it to be a side effect of concussions, but there haven't been any specific studies on it to say for certain. I was wondering if any other Redditors have similar symptoms after similar experiences?\nTL;DR:"}

Then this blow comes at me and it feels like my insides are churning. That being said, I have been very dependent on her and didn't see it as a problem (looking back, I understand and wish I could change my past actions in that regard). I don't have parents or any other support system and that has to be hard on her. She's my rock.\n\nI had total and complete trust, love, compassion, the works for this girl.

I tried talking to her about it multiple times, and she said she'll work on it but nothing is changing.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by Letting my Brothers onto an Social Experiment I was Planning.\nPOST: Not so recently, my grandma was put into a personal care home due to a broken hip and both of her daughters just not having the time to be able to care for her as she needs to be. More recently, the pitbull that the couple who run this home has had a litter of puppies. Out of the 8, 7 survived and 1 of those is the second smallest of the litter. She is extremely shy and the mother extremely protective of her. I decided I was going to name all of the pups and get the owners of the care home to start calling each pup by the name I had given them. There is Chewie, Shiva, Alfalfa, Spanky, Sugar Plum, Tommy, and finally, the focus of my fuck up, Fluttershy. She is the center of my social experiment. Since these pups will soon be fit to be taken away from their mother, I was going to use Shy as a way to figure out a rough estimate as to how many bronies live in my area, outside of high school and college, by how many prospective adopters catch on to the name. The fact that the pup is named after a pony from a TV show escaped from everyone, until today, when, in a discussion about Amnesia, I mention Alois from the Justine DLC of Amnesia. Both of my brothers ask who he is and I explain to them the previous information and am met with blank looks. I explain to them again as follows:\n\n\"Yeah, you remember, they took Fluttershy (the pony, not the pup) and made her into him in 'A Small Horse?'\" (A custom story for Amnesia for those who don't know)\n\nAnd that's when they connected the dots and questioned after my reasons for naming a beautiful and shy little pitbull pup after an animated pony from a TV show.\nTL;DR:"}

We met as he was finishing college and practically lived together before he left for a 3 month Army tour two weeks ago. When he first left I was feeling needy and read through a bunch of stuff on his laptop. I found out that he had sex with someone else about three months before he left and that essentially the whole time we have been together he has been in close contact with this one girl. I tried to be a good miliary girlf and didn't blow up all crazy to him with him being away, but this broke me inside. I never thought he would do it to me, I thought he was or is one of the good ones. He begged me for another chance, which I guess I have given him, but there are nights where I still do cry hour after hour over the betrayal. Since I found out he seems far more attentive, makes more promises like about us having kids and moving forward like getting engaged. All this before I found out I thought was going to happen. But now, I'm not sure if he is saying out of guilt or just to keep me. I'm completely confused and don't want to be played. I love him so so much but I don't want to be a walkover. The trust right now is hard. I know he can't cheat out there but I don't even know if he is still chatting to the girl he slept with.\nTL;DR:"}

We had planned a massive holiday together through Europe which went for about 9 weeks.   \n  \nShortly before the trip she broke up with me, looking back i could see why, i stopped paying attention to her and we drifted. We still went on the holiday together and we reconnected. We had an amazing time together and came back and the relationship continued.\n\nhere we are about 3 months after the trip and things werent sitting well with me. I approached her for a \"talk\" and we sat and nutted a few things out... not much long after we decided to mutually end things. We decided that it's not the right time for either of us.  \n  \nWe actually ended things really well, we had a good long hug and a kiss, we smiled and laughed and said we will talk to each other later. We have agreed to go no-contact for a month at least, so we can both objectively assess how we feel about each other. She said she has absolutely no interest in pursuing anybody else and i believe her (she has medical issues which can interfere with intimacy and its very embarrassing for her) and that she just wants to be by herself for a while.  \n  \nSo as it stands, we are split up. No matter what we both really want to be at least friends because neither of us want to throw away that incredible portion of our lives. We are on no contact for atleast 1 month pending our feelings for each other. I can't go forward from this expecting anything more than friends to happen because i know i will be disappointed if nothing happened. I want to move on, but i also want to remain friends. is no contact the way to go?\nTL;DR:"}

She sent me an email telling me how did I dare just to fuck up just now. She also wrote that she felt like I never even tried to understand her.\nI feel bad. I really tried, but she never talked about her feelings. She seldom said \"I love you\". Somehow she was the one who kept us together by bringing happy topics and greeting me everyday.\nFinally she wrote she didn't know what to feel. She now feels that everything \"would be soooo much easier now that things 'have changed'\". I feel guilty as fuck. She loved me, and I never believed her. She finally confessed how much she really loved, along with a farewell.\nI'm an asshole. I just sucked life from her and she never told me so. I, I, I don't know what to do.

He does sweet things for her like get her flowers on valentines day (this was before we started dating) and he's pretty flirty in conversation. I feel like I have a good sense of what's going on because I've definitely been \"friend zoned\" before and everything about this seems all too familiar.\n\nI don't necessarily feel threatened...I just feel bad.  I don't really even know the guy so it's not like I really ever talk to him, and he's never done anything drastic enough for the situation to be addressed by anyone.\n\nI can't blame my girlfriend either...I know a lot of times the girl gets blamed for leading the guy on in these situations, but really if she paid any less attention to him, she'd be flat out ignoring him.

I think she feels it would be presumptuous to assume he wants her, and doesn't want to lose him as a friend either.\n\nSo what (if anything) should I do?  Honestly, I do feel a tiny bit weird about his feelings for her. He lives on the other side of the country though, so it's hard to even feel threatened.  The reality is, I can all too easily put myself in his shoes because I've been there before, and the only thing that saved me from the heartache was to realize that I'm wasting valuable time, effort, thought and feelings waiting for a ship that won't set sail.\nTL;DR:"}

One thing lead to another and the police pulled the car over and found people smoking inside.\n\nThe driver and I (passenger) were arrested for possession and possession of paraphernalia. The others in the back seat were not charged with anything. Which does not make sense to me because I was the only one not smoking...

For this, I was charged with possession and the paraphernalia charge.\n\nHere is where I ask, what do I do now? If i plead guilty and go into the first offender's program, I will get kicked out of the Navy ( I don't want this to happen). If i plead not guilty, I believe that I have the resources to fight the case and that I should be able to win, but the problem is that my ship date is early February next year, and fighting the case could take a long time.\n\nThe driver of the car has said that he will appear, or if he can't he will deliver a letter that is signed and notarized to the court officials (we are not sure who to give it to yet) and that maybe my charges would be dropped.

A little history may be necessary to help understand the situation. \n\nWe are both 25, married three years, no kids, and started dating right at the end of high school. She was my first serious girlfriend and I was her second serious boyfriend. We dated throughout college (2 years semi-long distance) and got married shortly after graduation. We then both immediately started grand schools (same city, different schools) and I admit with the stress of schools we did start to drift apart. So about a year and a half into marriage we tried counseling and were making progress but our counselor unexpectedly quit and we had to find another. Our second counselor was no help at all (not for our lack of trying, she just was not good) and we stopped. Some aspects of our relationship were better but we were still drafting apart. \n\nThis past summer, I graduated from grad school (wife still in) and started a job and we tried another counselor. This one was great and was really working but insurance problems arose (briefly, the psychologist lied about if she took our insurance) and we could not afford to continue with her. That was 3 and a half months ago. Since then, things are gone seriously down hill. There is no cheating or physical or verbal violence, but she just does not want to be with me any more. I have tired to change and thought I have showed improvement but she says it is not enough and she is done. \n\nI care deeply for her and do not want a divorce, but I do not know if there is anything I can do. I did call a psychologist for myself and have an appt next week) to 1) fix what is wrong so if she does stay I can seriously improve and 2) have someone I can work on divorce issues with if she does leave.

How should I approach it?\nPOST: Hey Reddit,\n\nMy group mates (let's call them John, Dick and Harry) were working on a project. It's pretty common practice in this class to write every part of the report separately then at the end bring it all together. We had access to a report from a previous semester and we were looking at that for formatting and outline. \n\nDick decided that the things he wrote didn't sound nice enough and decided to copy a few sentences. He \"didn't realize that it was such a big deal in the US.\" (Dick is a foreign exchange student and actually sent me an email afterwards apologizing) Dick dropped the class before we got the report back. \n\nUsually, with the way the course is laid out, we would all be punishable with our professor's discretion. Our professor, however, has been approaching this from the beginning on the basis that the people responsible will be punished - and he has signed documentation from all of us describing what parts we worked on. \n\nJohn and I are being punished because our paper \"closely follows the layout of the other paper.\" I'm not sure if Harry was punished but an email from the professor stated that his decision was based on the fact that not everyone contributed equally to the plagiarism which implies to me that someone received a lesser punishment.\n\nThe punishment that John and I received was a 0 on the project grade (worth 6 percent of the final grade) and a letter grade in the course after. Dick doesn't know how they plan on following through with this punishment since he's no longer in the course and received a notice saying the same thing. \n\nI'm meeting with a board of four faculty members and two students on Monday to appeal the punishment. How should I go about it? What should I say?\n\nAll of the copying is in Dick's section of the paper but our professor believes that John and I have plagiarized based on the \"closely follows the layout\" bullshit. Our professor showed us \"examples\" of this by circling sections where we included things specified in the rubric of the project and said we took it from the other paper.\nTL;DR:"}

As a gift, my boyfriend made me GIFs of a sexual nature and sent them to me in an imgur album. It was highly appreciated on my end, but the only thing that sort of bothered me was the date the album was made and the view count at the bottom of the screen. Imgur says the album was made 5 days ago, and the album already has 16 views. My boyfriend says he made the GIFs and the album just today, and it's a private album so we should be the only ones moving the view count up. This leads me to believe that he has sent these images to other girls online.\n\nIs it wrong for me to believe Imgur over my boyfriend? He has, for the most part, been honest with me, I think. He's sort of easy to read, so I can tell when he's lying when we're face to face, but now that we're apart again, it's different. He's also made it a recent habit to talk to girls on skype who post naked GIFs of themselves on 4chan. I've discussed this with him, and he got upset over it because I demeaned the effort he put into making this present, and as a result it makes him feel undesirable.\nTL;DR:"}

In that time, I've known Doug to have a few very short term relationships, all ended by the girlfriend, but for him to mostly be single.  Doug does all the dating apps - Tinder, Happn, eHarmony, etc - and puts a tremendous amount of effort into finding a girl to settle down with.\n\nThe reason for his bad luck is obvious to me and to all of our mutual friends.  Doug's okay looking, but a bit overweight, bald, and not particularly fashionable.  He's a nice guy, but he's not especially charming or witty.  He lives in a flatshare.  I know that London's expensive, but as a single guy in your 40s, not having your own place isn't going to go well with the ladies.  All of this isn't to say that he can't find a girl - there's someone for everyone.  But he keeps going for knockout girls with successful careers who are at least ten years younger than himself.\n\nOn one hand, I'm getting a little tired of Doug whining that he has such bad luck with women every time I see him.  And on the other hand, he's a friend, and I genuinely want him to be happy.\n\nHow can I (or we) delicately suggest to Doug that he needs to lower his impossibly high standards if he wants to meet a woman and be happy with her?

They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to \"take him away\" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.\n\nI just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.\n\nI just don't know how to proceed; how do I win them over?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Do I have to give reward money if I put it on a poster? (WA)\nPOST: I know the title makes me sound like a jerk, but just hear me out. A little over a year ago, my brother and I had two new bikes go missing from inside my house, each worth about $1400. After they went missing we filed police reports and put up posters with reward for information on the bike's whereabouts and no response. One of the posters at a dog park was torn down the next day and I found that suspicious. Long story (kind of) short, my cousin and his friends go to that park very regularly and it never crossed my mind that he may have stolen it at the time. However, recent events such as him getting into drugs, stealing money from our house, stealing my shoes and misc items from around the house going missing when he comes over. (he's not allowed to come over ever again since he got caught stealing my shoes) I'm beggining to think he stole the bikes too. Now, thinking back it very well could have been him that tore down the poster because he was afraid one of his druggie friends would turn him in for the reward money. Plus, he was the only person to visit that week that didn't live here. My question is: If I put up a poster that says something like '$500 reward for information on the theft of these bikes at this time' and one of his druggie friends rats on him for the reward money, am I legally required to pay him?\nTL;DR:"}

I go to school on the west coast and she goes to a school in the south. We started dating before leaving for school. We recently finished our first year of distance, but that's not the problem. \n\nI fell that I love this girl and I was ready to tell her. However, recently she told me that she wants to wait until marriage to have sex because it's less risky to have sex with your husband than a boyfriend. We do everything else just no actual sex. We are both virgins. I feel like this would be no problem if she had told me this before we got serious, but now I feel like she's revealing a whole new part of herself a year into the relationship. I didn't know how to react or how to deal with it. Now I'm wondering what I should do in the relationship. I know people break up over sex and it's a big part of a relationship. I never considered sex to be that big of a deal personally, but I never imagined that id be in a relationship where it's completely off of the table. When I look for advice online, I find Christian websites that talk about how it strengthens your relationship and I'm sure that's true. I also find personal pieces about women who aren't virgins and then decided to do it, but I haven't found anything that helps me. I feel like if I stay with her and we don't get married then I might of messed up. I do think I love this girl, she makes me happy in every way, but now when I think about this, it frustrates me. And I feel like I can't really love someone if I can't accept such a big part of their life. What do I need to do?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm currently a 15 year old sophomore in High-school and i'm gradually losing the motivation for school I once had. It wasn't always like this, from 1-6th grade I was an excellent student, straight A's pretty easily which isn't that praiseworthy since it's middle school. I moved to a new town and my grades took a slight hit in 7th due to adjustment to new town and new friends, nonetheless they were back to all straight A's, 8th grade was also straight A's.\n\nNow the interesting part is High school. I entered high-school Freshman year with the same mindset I had in middle school. \"I'll never study and still get straight A's\". This of course failed me, but I caught on and my grades we're decent from A- to B-, which of course was a little disappointing.\n\nFast forward to now halfway into the first quarter of Sophomore year my motivation is completely gone. My grades currently are an A, A, C-, A.\n\nAlgebra 2 Honors seems to be my Achilles heel. I failed my first test (57) which was my own fault due to my slacking off and not studying. \nSo I decided to go work very hard and study for the next test day in and day out to get that 100. I was extremely confident going into it and finished the test. My grade? 49. F. Pitiful. After seeing my grade I've just lost all my motivation...I'm seeking out to all the insightful people on Reddit to just help me. I really just need someone to give me any kind of advice.\nTL;DR:"}

(I don't completely agree with that. Since i believe when you marry someone you marry their family). On another note I'm unsure how to feel on my end and find it very off-putting that my mother would say something like that, after almost a year of knowing her and especially since she doesn't fit any of the typical stereotypes about someone of her ethnicity.

We had an \"epic discussion\" about the rationale behind why people (such as me) watch reality television, which was fine until he told me that he was disappointed that I do. \n\nTo clarify, I don't really enjoy tv all that much; I think it's a cheap medium among other issues (which I of course didn't tell him). He tried to show me one of his favorite shows that he thought I would like. I did a not so nice thing and started teasing about the show, making commentary that pointed out its predictability. He got really offended; I didn't realize it at the time, but he said I was being rude. He said he felt like I didn't respect what he does, which I understand now.\n\nI let him know that I was profusely sorry, that sometimes I just like to tease and prove people wrong, but I take it too far without knowing (he said that was a pretty terrible trait to have lol). I also explained that I appreciated his passion, but I just don't like to take anything too seriously, and I'm really bad with dealing with it when people are sensitive about something, since I don't really feel that strongly about things like that. I told him I really hate hurting people's feelings, and he said I could use some more tact.\n\nLater on, I told him I felt weird about everything, though I said it's kinda my fault. He was nice and said it was kinda his fault too. He said we should still hang out, and that he felt bad for ruining my night, and we both apologized again (though I feel like there's a possibility he might have said this to get laid since we were in his bed).\n\nAt this point, I feel a little bit like a terrible person, and that we're too incompatible to continue.

We have always used a condom and we were thinking about trying without, and while that was happening we also talked about pregnancy and all that stuff.

There are children (5) involved ages 2-8\n\nIt's been 2/3 almost 4 years watching this relationship fall apart. The cheating started slowly as emotional. Soon became physical once or twice. Fine, an affair is an affair none of my business. After 4 years it's developed into a dangerous sketchy path in my opinion especially since there are children involved and people's lives. \n\nHer Facebook account was logged onto my computer, so naturally I snooped as I know what she's up to, as she tells me. At this point, she is meeting random strangers off Tinder, Plenty of Fish etc. And having sex with them.  Sometimes for money, gifts etc. Her Facebook inbox is full of messages to strangers, guys, sending graphic nudes etc. \n\nShe's fooled around with friends of hers husbands, while fooling around with this wife. This is only the tip of the iceberg. \n\nThis is and has effected friends and my own marriage as she is sketchy and my own partner is very nervous when she is around as she has put many of us in bad positions and uncomfortable situations.  \n\nHer SO is not stupid but I don't think he understands the extent of what's going on. He's also previously divorced (kids from this marriage) which I think might add to his hesitation for addressing any assumptions he may have. What's also alarming is she is still having sex with her husband. \n\nProblem: Do I tell him? And if so how do I tell him without actually telling him. I don't want to be involved in this. Just want him to know, with proof, but remain anonymous. Ideas?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm looking for some advice for how I can help out my lodger, and also how I can navigate a delicate situation.\n\nShe is a 30-something year old immigrant who works in a coffee shop, but she just got a voluntary position at a research library which is her chosen career path.\n\nShe's been hinting that she's going to have to apply for a tax credit, because she's going to be working fewer hours. The alternative is that she may need to borrow money from her parents to pay the rent.\n\nNow I'm tempted to offer another reduction, because it's great that she's doing the internship to help her move into work that she cares about. However I already reduced her rent a couple of months ago to a lower amount. This was basically because renting sucks and landlords are assholes - I wanted to get a friendlty housemate who makes a reasonable contribution to the mortgage, but who I'm not fleecing.\n\nAlso I'm reticent to take responsibility for her finances. She's said herself that she struggles with motivation, so if I make things easy for her she may just sit back and not really do anything with the volunteering opportunity...\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do. A few options that came to mind include:\n\n* Don't say anything, but drop some hints that I might be flexible, forcing her to take responsibility for asking for help\n* Look into her options for benefits, as an EU immigrant\n* Be direct about it, and tell her I'm concerned that she may not be able to pay the rent level we agreed\n\nAny ideas appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

He's a total sweetheart and big old mush who has probably had a pretty rough go of things. We are really trying to do the [two week shutdown] but discovered he has some serious anxiety. He escaped our last cage twice before we reinforced it with zip ties. [Then he just bent the metal and slid under.]  I bought a new, [heavier crate] that we reinforced like fort knox and got carabiner clips for the two doors. We have done LOTS of treats in the crate (including a hardy chew bone filled with frozen peanut butter) and he goes in fine. Once he's in and the door is closed, he panics. He ripped the tray of the last crate up in only minutes while we were still in the apartment. I wonder if his several successful escapes have encouraged him to thrash about in there like he does, but who knows. He has [some marks on his nose] that might be scars from who knows what happened to him (he was found in Trenton).\n\nToday we tried a new tactic because I didn't want him to impale himself on metal while I was at work. When he escaped the first two times, he didn't destroy anything, so I left him isolated in the bedroom with his crate open and lots of treats after a big walk. [Alas, he did not like that option either.] While that really sucks about the carpet, I'm mostly just relieved that he has not hurt himself yet.\n\nThis evening we went on another big walk/jog and have been practicing the crate in 10 minute increments with lots of treats (no worries about him not gaining weight, eh?). Nonetheless, I don't know what to do with him tomorrow when I go to work. I want to do right by this dog and do NOT want him to get hurt. Any suggestions on the safest way to leave him?\nTL;DR:"}

During our first year together she invited me to a party where she got drunk and I had to take care of her. At one point we were separated for a few minutes and she found her way back to me. In that time she said \"My girl friend just kissed me, is that okay?\", not wanting to argue I said \"it's fine, sit down\", to which she replied \"I know it's not okay, I'm sorry\".\n\nA week or so later I asked her about that night, because I had concerns about her kissing other people when she knew it wasn't okay. I wasn't mad at her kissing another girl, but the fact that she knew it wasn't okay, but did anyway. My main concern was her cheating on me and using her drunkenness as an excuse. I wasn't mad at the action of her kissing a girl. She then assured me that she wouldn't ever cheat on me. \n\nFast forward to a week ago, we got to another party with a female friend. Everyone is having a great night, but then my girlfriend taps me on the shoulder and say that she was just kissed by her friend. This didn't bother me at first because I thought her female friend just gave he a peck. However, she later admitted it was mutual. This bothered me alot.\n\nToday on the phone, we got into an argument about how I'm making a big deal out of nothing. I tried explaining that my main problem was that she knew she was doing something wrong, but did it anyway. She understood that, but still saw nothing wrong. Everytime I brought up something she said that night to support what I was saying (Like her saying \"sorry, I know that bothered you\"), she'd get angrier because I was \"using her words against her\".\n\nWe ended up hanging up on each other, I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

At first she wasn't cuddling, I thought she was just cold because shes done it before. \n\nWe watched an episode, then the next one starts and then she said \"Can we talk?\" my heart sank immediately, I had this horrible gut feeling that she wanted to end our relationship. She did. \n\nHer reasoning was because, the distance, school and it felt like she wasn't dating me. (Shes in Pharmacy school so it is a lot of work). \n\nSure I felt the same that we have lost a bit of the fire but that happens in a distance relationship. Something just doesn't feel right about it to me. I mean we've been dating for 8 months of distance and we were fine her first semester. But I don't know, any thoughts/advice?\nTL;DR:"}

This winter break, he has invited me to stay with him at his parents' house, which is about an hour away from his college campus.\n\nI would be so excited to see him, and I do love his family. The problem is his family's smoking habit. They all smoke cigarettes, inside the house, outside the house, on the furniture, etc. I grew up in a house without pets, smoking, not even aerosol air fresheners in the air, so I am very sensitive to it. My boyfriend, on the other hand, doesn't smoke but isn't bothered by the smokey smell in the house.\n\nI'd be happy to stay with him on campus, then drive to his parents' house for the day, then back at night to sleep. But sleeping at his parents' house would be extremely uncomfortable for me. When I spent the evening there a few months ago, I had to wash my clothes that I had been wearing almost immediately because the smoke had permeated the fabric--even after only a few hours!\n\nWhen we have discussed logistics about my visit, he seemed to accept my response that \"I'd be more comfortable sleeping in your apartment on-campus.\" But I think this issue will  come up again if our (awesome) relationship continues as it has been, and I want to be able to have this conversation before it becomes too much to discuss.\n\nHow do I express my concern about this without hurting his--or his family's--feelings?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/Parenting\nTITLE: Daycare called CPS on us. Anyone else have experience with this?\nPOST: 2 weeks ago my infant came home with a tiny bruise on her arm. It was small and reddish and after some panicky googling, I concluded that maybe she got to sucking on her arm, or it possibly got pinched in the Velcro of her sleep sack. Of course it was all speculation, but regardless, I figured that it wasn't a huge deal because it didn't bother her, and it was so small. \n\nFast forward to Tuesday, I am changing her (now 11 week old) and notice the same thing on her leg. I was quite faint, and I touched it to see if it was sensitive, and it didn't phase her. I got her dressed and took her right to daycare. \n\nThat night, my husband calls me in tears saying that a social worker has been there asking my family very slanted questions. I rush home and got interviewed which was so hard. We rush her to the local children's hospital to get her evaluated to make sure there wasn't a medical cause for the easy bruising. There, we were treated like child abusers. They had a security guard sitting outside of our door the entire time. They left the the door open so staff could keep an eye on us. A forensic photographer documented took pictures of it. It was humiliating and awful. I just held my daughter and cried. No one has even been close to rough with my daughter. \n\nOnce a few doctors and nurses saw what we were there for, they started being really friendly to us. I think a few realized that we wouldn't hurt her, but they had a job to do, which I understood. If they didn't investigate hard enough, and a child was being abused, it would be terrible. \n\nI'm not even sure that the bruises didn't come from the daycare itself. I came in to her laying in a seat on the floor, and a toddler crawling all over her once. She just wasn't hurt, so i wasn't really upset about it. Not to mention a toddler busted his head open there last week on a sharp wood corner.\n\nAnyone else have experience with this at all? How did you handle the situation? \nHere's a picture of the bruise.\nTL;DR:"}

I showed up around 8 with a few other people and someone had bought nearly 10 McChickens for some reason. Fast forward to around 12 and I'm pretty drunk and kind of hungry. I walk upstairs into the kitchen and what do I see? *Motherfucking McChickens* in all of their crispy, shitty, third-world country quality glory. In my inebriated state I realized that they had been sitting out, un-refridgerated, for about 4 hours now and I they probably aren't good, but I figure I can stick them in the microwave for about 15 seconds to heat them up and kill all of the bacteria. This was a terrible idea. I'm walking back to my apartment across campus at around 3am and my stomach starts to hurt and I realize I have to shit and I won't make it back unless I relieve myself, and the only building that I think will be open is the chapel that's on campus. Church's are always open, right? It was. So I go into the bathroom to do the deed and as I'm hunched over in bowel-bending glory shitting my brains out, I get the urge to throw up and I realize I probably shouldn't have eaten 3 of the 4 hour old McChickens. So here I am stuck on the toilet when I spew my food goo all over the church bathroom in the most unholy of ways. It was awful.\nTL;DR:"}

We all met through our love of one song, and as soon as I started singing, they too, started singing. That's how i ended up making out with Janet while Jennifer was laughing about it with her other friends. After this finished, I managed to get along with Jennifer really well, and ended up talking for the rest of the evening. She was constantly giving me compliments, about how I was attractive, intelligent and funny. Although Jennifer was under the influence of alcohol, after she sobered up was insistent on me sleeping at her house, and was quite keen on us catching up even after that. So after the party finishes, I head back with Jennifer to her apartment where things ended up getting quite heated. Despite her being on her period, she gave me head and that was all for the night. She had to get up quite early, around 8 am for church and so I had to leave too, we end it on a hug and she once again says that we should talk soon.\n\nDillema: This happened on Saturday, and on the monday I decided to shoot her a Facebook message. It appeared as though she had quite a dull personality over facebook, however that wasn't really bothering me. I asked her if she was keen on hanging out on the weekend or if she was free any time soon to which she replied \"yeah, that would be good, although I'm going to my beach house on the weekend so I can't\" that was that and I decided to leave it there after a bit of casual chat.\nWe haven't spoken since, and despite her saying that she was going away for the weekend she had uploaded photos of her at her house seemingly getting ready for a party. So she obviously stayed.\n\nShould I bother asking if she wants to catch up on the weekend? Or is it a lost cause. I'm just confused, she was quite adament on talking and catching up while I was with her, but lied about where she was this past week.\nThanks, any advice is appreciated\nTL;DR:"}

Now that i've began to gain weight (a couple years later) every time I decide to begin running again, I end up pushing myself too hard, too quick and then I get injured.

She broke up with me with no warning or any indication. Just stopped talking to me. I had assumed something terrible had happened when she suddenly wouldn't return any calls or texts, but when I stopped by her home she kicked me from her doorstep, refusing to talk to me or explain anything.\n\nIt's been months and I feel like a shadow of my former self. I stayed No Contact and was doing well until I went back on Facebook and saw pictures through a mutual friend.

She doesn't even seem like the same person who so used and abused me.\n\nI go to therapy and am on anti-depressant. I have a history of depression and so I've always taken proactive measures to deal with it. But after all this, nothing seems to make me happy. It feels like I'm drifting through the days. I don't know what else to do to move on. I've tried it all. I'm always worried I'll run into her.\n\nThanks for reading.\nTL;DR:"}

I had gotten all my groomsmen lined up, or so I thought. One of the guys I was going to ask has been my friend since I was in 10th grade. We've always talked about being in each others wedding etc. \n\nWhen my fiance' and I had finally set a date my buddy sent me a text saying he supported me getting married he just didn't agree with it. He doesn't get a warm fuzzy about my fiance'. He says there are things that rub him the wrong way he just can't put his finger on it. \n\nAt first I was going to ask him to be a groomsman and just shuffle him at the end, away from my future bride. However that thought changed when my fiance' went on FB and found that my buddy and his g/f had both blocked her from FB and pinterest. Now she doesn't want him to have anything to do in the wedding party. I'm torn because of the friendship that he and I have had all these years. He is the only one that doesn't get a warm fuzzy about my fiance'. At first I chalked it up to you don't have to agree with who a person is dating but if you are friends you'll support them no matter what, now I don't know what to think. While I want him to be involved if he doesn't agree with my choices, what's the point, no matter what history we have? Easier to ask people on here rather than talk to someone in my life about it because I'm a man and we don't share feelings.\n\nAny fellow redditors been in a situation like this before?

My gf is petite, thin, but has great curves. She has some insecurities herself but I on the other hand am a bit flabby in places and pretty darn hairy all over. When we have sex I always refuse to take my shirt off because I worry she'd be turned off by my body hair and stomach. This is partially because I know she used to be sexually active with guys who were a lot more attractive than me (I'm talking about barely-hairy, abs, and full-on gains type of guys). Also I need to throw this in here but I'm pretty sure my dick is the smallest one she's seen because before we had sex she told me she always gagged while giving bjs but she dominates that thing like its nothing. Sorry, tmi. I should be proud. \n\nAnyways, I keep telling myself I'll start hitting the gym more, and she encourages me to do so as well, promising that she'll work hard on her body too. But for some reason I get discouraged by the idea of her continuing to work out since she already has a great body. It bothers me, not sure why, and it makes me feel more sensitive.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: Broke up a week ago, got closure when I probably shouldn't have.\nPOST: So last Monday my now ex-girlfriend of  two years and I mutually broke up. My grandmother is in the hospital and it's stressful on my family, she had her family problems so we decided we needed to just end it (and later I found out she had just been unhappy for a while and never tried to fix it with me). Basically I had the typical break up anxiety to talk to her, was not eating and just was having a rough time in my thoughts. I sent her flowers to try and patch things up, didn't work. Obviously I knew it wasn't going to be, \"Oh hey! I'll send her flowers and that'll make EVERYthing better!\" It was more like, \"Let's send a peace offering to at least talk about it a little.\" and we talked, it seemed like she was swaying both ways. \nThe denial in me was like, \"yayayayayay.\" but there was something still... not right to it. One of the things we agreed upon in the breakup was that she wanted to know about my grandmother's progress and yesterday (it just turned midnight here on the east coast) I did just that. It seemed like she didn't want to talk so I was like, \"alright, what's the deal?\" and we talked, I tried to plead my way in again because I still care for her and everything. She was my first real love, we all know how that goes. But ultimately I got my closure and it was, \"I just want to be single and I don't see us getting back together.\" and I can accept that because I know sometime down the line we're gonna see each other, our state is not that big. \n<br>So in the future, near or far, we'll see each other and be friends again. I can already feel me becoming me again because I have closure to this situation, where as my head the past week was like, \"DUDE THINK. HOW CAN YOU GET HER BACK!?\" and now it's just, \"Hey, you tried, but you'll see her again later in life. Or maybe not, just text some friends.\" So I'm fine now, it'll take time to really get over her but I can finally think about other things.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: With the recent shootings, mostly in gun free zones, why are those restricting guns not being held responsible?\nPOST: Our government and legal system asserts that citizens of the US have the right to [self-defense] and in some states even the right to alter ego defense, defense of others, or defense of a third person.  As recently as 2008 and 2010 the supreme court ruled that the second amendment ensures American's the right to \"protects an individual's right to possess a firearm, unconnected to service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\"([1]  Guns are also an effective means of self defense and a survey of criminals shows that many have been \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\" and that \"Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\"([2]  Obviously how effective, whether they are the best defense, injury rates, etc. can be debated, but they clearly are an effective means of self defense.  One of the much more important aspects of the facts here that most people do not seem to be aware of is that the supreme court has also ruled in 2005 that [police officers are not constitutionally bound to protect citizens](\n\nSo, as things currently stand legally, American's have the right to guns, and the right to self-defense, and the police have no responsibility to defend citizens.  Therefore, the responsibility and the rights to do so fall squarely on the shoulders of individuals.  If an individual chooses to not defend themselves with a gun and something happens to them, that was clearly their choice and since it was their responsibility only the criminal need be held responsible.  BUT, when a gun free zone is created, the right of the individual to defend themselves has been taken away by a third party.  That third party could be the government when we are talking about government buildings like court houses, or a business when we are talking about malls, or theaters, or the state when we are talking about college campuses or public schools.\nTL;DR:"}

Thankfully, the water was clean so I quickly retrieved my property as quick as I could.

Quickly dried it and opened the back to find more water so I turned it off right away (it was still working). Another dry session with tissue and place the phone in a pack of rice as I know from my experience that it is meant to \"absorb\" the moisture.\n\nThis occurred in the morning so the phone was in the pack of rice for the whole day when I decided to check if everything works. The phone won't turn on. I dismiss this as the battery was quite low in the first place so I let it charge for the whole night. \n\nStill nothing. I was concerned and research more to find nothing. I decide that I should check it out myself and open it up. Apart from a bit of rusting on the vibrator, I see nothing. Even the red indicator that shows water damage is not triggered so hopefully if my phone still doesn't work, then, the insurance covers it. Although, it would mean making something up to tell my dad about it.\n\nWhat I don't understand is that the phone is meant to be \"water-proof\" but it is still damaged somehow.

I am 24 years old and this thinning progression clearly has been occurring for some time and I was oblivious. I am in shock and I can't help it and start crying in the bathroom. My little cousin must have the ears of a greater wax moth because he was at the bathroom door within seconds asking what was wrong. I told him I was fine and would be out in a minute; I couldn't pull myself together I was in shock. I am not supposed to go bald nobody in my family is bald, why me? I open the bathroom door and borderline sprint to my grandma give her a hug and say bye, I get out of the house to my car before more family notice my state. I drive home and look at my phone with a myriad of anger texts asking why I was crying and left before even saying hello.\nTL;DR:"}

So this morning I looked on her phone, basically she asked him her feelings towards her. He said he hates that she's \"the one who probably could have been\", to which she responded \"I might still be the one\". Then he said he was alone in bed, she likewise (bullshit, I would have been with her that night), he replied \"don't tempt me, because I will come round\". Then the conversation moved to our last holiday with no mention of me, as if she went alone. Then they signed off with \"love you\".\n\nShe finished in the bathroom so I couldn't read the rest. Sounds like an old flame, but this doesn't look good. Now she's gone to work for the day, being in a room, with him. Not feeling great.\n\nWe bought a flat together a month ago, so this makes the situation a lot more difficult. I'd also hate breaking up with her as she's usually my rock. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Saturday my friend was celebrating her 21st at a club a city, keeping in mind this is the city I work EMS in.\n\nI was hesitant going for a few factors including that I haven't been out partying since needing a G Tube (Earned myself a brain injury last winter), some physical issues, and it is the city I work in. I never want to see people from work off duty. \n\nIn the end I went. My SO and I booked a hotel in the city to stay away from having to drive to point A to point B after drinking and so we can actually get plastered. \n\nFast forward, I was wearing a cute outfit and arranged the outfit so I was able to drag the tube up inside my dress to hang out the front a little for easy access. That was fine.\n\nWe get there and we all started drinking, of course me being the main attraction because I use a tube to take in stuff through the hatch. There was a lot of \"Chugs\" down my tube and mixing drinks. I did a lot of \"birthday shots\" with my friend (The birthday girl) and it was just crazy.\n\nBy maybe 230am I was plastered. The big guys in black shirts dragged me to the side of the building because I was blacking out and falling over. I started throwing up out of my G Tube and mouth. It was disgusting. My poor dress. I remember crying and yelling \"Oh my god, I'm going to die\". It literally felt like when you are throwing and you feel your stomach tighten, and that is when the everything started coming out.\n\nIt was a hot mess. I was called in as a \"21, ETOH, active vomiting\". My buddies picked me and drove me to the hospital where I sobered up. The ER thought I would get less drunk if they emptied my stomach smh They were really cool about it though and stopped in to see if I sobered up each time they came through the ER.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Reconciling after infidelity\nPOST: Market nsfw in case of possible later edits and language. \n\nI apologize in advance for the wall of text. I'm (27m) having trouble reconciling with my wife (24f) after her affair one month into our marriage. We have been together for 8 years, a rocky beginning for the first year or so ( leftover shit from a previous controlling/mentally abusive relationship she was in before me) and married for just over a year now. I had confirmation of the affair from her after it fizzled out mostly and then she cut contact, trickle truth type admittance from her. Because we are close to our families and have mutual friends I don't feel comfortable telling anyone we know and not having anyone to talk to besides her is really affecting my ability to deal with this. The reasoning behind it was a few things, ongoing depression for most of her life, stress from a car accident and wedding planning, friction between her and my family, her stupid best friend that basically encouraged her, and an opportunic asshole who slipped in at the right time, and manipulated her into thinking he understood her depression because he had been there, and that he Cared about her. I know she's not blameless in this and played her part as well. Anyways, I range from having trouble accepting it even happened, to a weird detached not caring, almost like the affair was a previous relationship, utter rage, and confusion/despair. Since she admitted it happed she has been very open and answers any questions I have and is giving me anything I need, and trying very hard to make things work, but I don't think she could have fucked up worse than she did, it's so bad.  But I've hit a wall, I still love her, and want her to be the one I spend my life with and have kids ect ect, but right now I feel like her affair has made that impossible, its almost like she's my soulmate/first choice/ love of my life whatever you want to call it, but is no longer an actual option. Anyone who is willing to help, I would greatly appreciate it, and will answer any questions you have.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by thinking a beagle couldn't reach food\nPOST: Some backstory, I work at a boarding kennel, and this happened just a couple hours ago as I was preparing to close up. So just before we close we do feeds, and certain dogs that are brought in together have to be fed separately (e.g. if one is on meds, or in this case, they're both piggies and fight over every crumb). I had taken two beagles outside of the kennel in and left them in separate areas so that they could each eat whilst I went to feed the rest of the dogs. Here's where I fucked up: two other dogs also had to be fed separately, so I took their bowls and set them aside so they could be fed later, up on a counter 3 times the height of the beagles, thinking they'll be alright as all I have to do is open the door to 3 kennels, slide the bowls in, and shut the door (and also I'm only approximately 12 feet away). So I go to do this, and as soon as I'm inside the building, I hear the sound of metal on concrete. I think little of it, as the beagles often flip their bowls over to ensure every inch is licked clean. Approximately 90 seconds later I'm back outside, only to find that not only has one beagle eaten all her own food, but also somehow jumped up (there was nothing she could have climbed) and finished off 2 other large bowls of food. Again, within <90 seconds.\nTL;DR:"}

We were supposed to hang out Monday but she ended up going out to eat with her mother and a friend of hers. She said shed be over during the night, but she never came and said that it was because her mom wanted her to go shopping with her, yet she had her own car. I was pissed off because I should have left to go to school earlier and I stayed around for her.... I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing but she also lies about when she's going to bed, I tried calling her last night and she just hung up and claimed she's trying to sleep, but you know how on Kik how the delivery messages work? Well it showed that she very much wasn't trying to sleep. Call me a nut or whatever idgaf. I just want input from a non anxious outside source. She claims to love me, to want to stay with me and that shell be open with me but she doesn't bloody text me at all. Not to mention she said she wants to hang out more but of course that doesn't happen. I feel used. Idk what to do because she'll talk to other guys she doesn't know but not me. What the fuck.

Since then they've been texting on and on for I guess the past 5 years but I didn't think it would be this intense since he lives 500 miles from her. Since that day 5 years ago, my brother (they are both 21) has been mostly unsuccessful with girls. He had one girlfriend at the end of high school but that didn't last long, none throughout all of his 3 years so far at college and hasn't gotten much action from others. One day out of the blue, he said that he and this girl were in a relationship. Since then, they have seen each other in person once and after that she has always cancelled on him when they planned to get together. I don't really understand it because she spends a lot of time on the phone with him (and texting is nearly constant). Worse off, he claims that he is in love with her after 4 months (and may I reiterate that they have only met in person ONCE in the last 5 years!) He plans to keep this relationship alive indefinitely, and I believe that doing that will destroy any chances of him finding true love in a closer place (that won't cancel on him on every attempt to see her).

She's my first real relationship, and things have been going very well. Although there is one thing I am trying to get past: her history with other people.\nHere's where things get hard for me. Before her the most I had done was kiss a few girls here and there. Nothing to the magnitude of having a girlfriend. However her history is much different. I'm talking multiple ex-bf's, FWBs, one night stands, and bicurious behavior. \nThings in the relationship have been going very well, and very smoothly. \nThe issue is I have some insecurities when things in her past come up and she talks about them. She knows I was a virgin before her, and doesn't care, but when things come up in her past I get a little uneasy about things, I try to take it as well as I can. Like I said the relationship has been going very well and I would not want to end things for a stupid reason like me having insecurities. \nSo to people that have been in this situation, where you are vastly out-experienced in the relationship/sexual area: how have you accepted their past. I see no reason to end a relationship because of it; sometimes is just hard to look past and be confident about the future.\nTL;DR:"}

After a few tussles and careful supervision, the two dogs don't get into arguments anymore (he even lets her steal his food.)\n\nBut overall she came to me really good, no accidents in the house, sits real well (almost too well, I can't get her to stay standing,) knew her name, doesn't jump on furniture or people even when prompted to. \n\nI'm sure that whatever abuse she received in the past made her very cautious, she does NOT like playing of any sort.

Then I moved in with my boyfriend and his much younger dog, and when they play together sometimes, especially when they go on for long enough, she'll nip him or the other dog, and sometimes bark (something she never does.)

So my partner and I are both 19 years old and have been dating for 5 years. Over the past few months she has stopped wanting sex entirely, and she obliges to have it once or twice a month only because I pester her a lot. Today she told me that she may have become \"asexual\" in that she neither needs nor desires sex at all.\n\nI have the highest libido imaginable; If alone I could masturbate 1-5 times a day. I don't intend on breaking up with her, because I have a great relationship outside of sex, and I don't logically see the difference between masturbating a lot whether in a relationship or while single and alone, but this is something that I know will become more and more frustrating as I am left to my own devices to fulfill whatever sexual \"needs\" I have along with her just not really wanting sex and appearing to not really enjoy the sex I do have with her. \n\nShe seemed kind of upset that, when asked, I said that I think sex is important to me and that I think it is in most relationships. Her point of reference seems to be that she has read about couples who just forego sex entirely, kind of implying that it is only the strength and authenticity of their bond that keeps them together instead of something shallow and physical like sex. I don't think she believes me when I say sex is an important thing in almost every serious relationship. I don't know if I believe myself. I feel shallow for valuing sex, and I'm not sure if I am right for wanting sex so much. \n\nIs this just the outcome of all long term relationships? It seems bleak to believe that it is inevitable, but most things are, I guess.\n\nRight now it isn't a huge problem, because it hasn't been like this for too long, but I know this is going to cause problem down the line, and with her saying that she is basically asexual, the thought of this just never really resolving makes me anxious.\nTL;DR:"}

I have a hard time talking about these feelings with my partners because I feel like it would really hurt them to say that I've been thinking about a new relationship.\n\nThe most troublesome thing to me is that it's not even a specific thing or person that starts to spark these feelings. it's not like I see an attractive girl at the gym or on campus and immediately start fantasizing about her. Instead, I'm fantasizing about some sort of ideal partner that's entirely in my head. It's no specific person, just a collection of idea about how the perfect girl and all the fun things we'd do together that for whatever reason me and my current girlfriend aren't doing.

I'm perfectly happy with everything in the relationship but there seems to be some stress about whether or not we're planning for children. \nWhen we first met children were a hard 'no' in his life. After a few months he said it was a possibility if the right woman came along. He still tells people now that he's happy that he doesn't have children and he looks forward to having money in the future for not having children. He actually makes fun of his friends for having children. He's raised an apart adaptive son for 9 years so I understand that he's done the child raising thing before. It ended in heartbreak and loss so I'm not sure if his reaction is because he has genuinely decided he doesn't want kids or he's just really heartbroken that he raised a kid and then lost him. He's a fairly closed off person emotionally so it's difficult getting a straight answer about it. \nI've talked to him about possibly wanting children and he says if I really want one he'll do it but I'm really worried that he'll resent me for having a child or that I'll resent him for not. I'm still unsure of whether I want children but I'm afraid I'm just convincing myself that I don't want kids to make him happy. \nI'm wondering if any of you have been in similar situations and how you dealt with it and what you wish you did.

They had one of those security tags on them where if you broke it off it would explode ink everywhere. Well the cashier had forgotten to take it off and we didn't notice until we got home. \n\nAbout three days later (it was about a 30 minute drive to the store we purchased them from where we lived, so there was no sense in driving back the day of) we brought our receipt back and asked them to take off the badge thing. They refused saying we were attempting to steal them although we had clearly walked in with the pants in hand and directly to customer service. \n\nI understand some people will take stuff of the rack and give a previous receipt asking for money back, that sorta thing but come on..? Do you think a clean cut mother with a 4 year old girl and 7 year old boy is going to steal child's pants? That also made a $200 purchase three days earlier? The manager even treated us like criminals and we ended up having to throw away a perfectly good pair of pants because they thought we were stealing.\n\nI will now always check in front of cashiers as they put the clothes in the bag that they remove those things. And I will also never shop at that retail chain again after there horrible customer service.\nTL;DR:"}

Since getting this job, our relationship has slipped further down his list of priorities to the point where he shows no interest in me or my life (social activities, work, school) and I'm lucky if I see him 1 every couple of weeks. This may sound like a lot given the circumstances but we live fairly close to one another.\n\nHe now chooses to spend his free time at home and won't even call me or text me as much as he used to. He flakes our on plans too.I basically feel as though all romance, affection, or attention in our relationship has come to a gradual halt. And when I bring up, I get that I'm being clingy. Am I being clingy? Is there anyway I can ask him for a little more attention and effort on his behalf without being too demanding?\nTL;DR:"}

I asked what he was calling about, he said he couldn't tell me, but he was calling from the NYC District Attorney's office, and an agent had a few questions for any employee of my company.  They didn't know my name, they'd just called the company's general number.  He passed the phone off quickly to this \"agent\", who said he needed to talk to me in person.  I asked what about, he said he couldn't say over the phone.  I asked who he worked for, he said the UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE.  I chuckled and said he must be kidding me, he said he wasn't.  I asked if I should be worried, he said absolutely not.  Then he said he'd call again tomorrow to set a meeting.  No more details.\n\nI googled the number ((646) 839-2477) and it's from a landline in Midtown, even though the NYC DA office is in lower Manhattan.

I was on vacation in italy with my family, and from day 1 it started. I assumed it was a bad bed, and looked forward to the next hotel we would go to after the first week, but that didn't change anything, even my own bed at home isn't any better. It seems that the longer I sleep the worse it gets, so it seems that it has something to do with laying down for extended periods of time.\n\nOne might start to think of my size by now, but I actually lost 5kg's on said vacation, and didn't have these problems prior to my vacation.\n\nOne thing does spring to mind, is my older brother (well half-brother, but meh) who has been diagnosed with a very rare disease where his liver and lung doesn't heal, and therefore if he doesn't go light on them, they get worse. (he's lived 1 year in china with work, and that gave him some lung pains) I however find it very unlikely that I have this, as both parents need to carry the illness and even then theres only 1/4 a chance to get it, and he and I have different mothers.\n\nIt's not that big of an issue, it's just more of an annoyance, but I'm curious as to what it could be?\nTL;DR:"}

Anyway so before I actually begin with the story let me tell you that about a week ago I hooked up with a really beautiful girl I've always had a crush on. So after a few days of getting to know each other a bit better, we went on our first date and everything was so perfect. I learned she liked ACDC a lot, and she learned I loved rap. I didn't state any one person though, so she may have assumed I liked Eminem and/ or Snoop Dogg (which I do.) Everything is going fine and dandy until yesterday. During school I told her she should come over to meet my parents. She called her parents and they were fine with it too. Great right? Wrong. Here comes the tifu. So I got home yesterday and decided to listen to some music before she came over. I plugged in my headphones, the ones that really suppress outside noises, and started singing along to Big L's '98 Freestyle. Well it was getting to the end of the first verse, and my mom let in my girlfriend so we could all talk. They walk in, and since I'm facing away from them I didn't notice either. Right when they walk in I sing the line, \"If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool.\" I hear a door slam and I quickly turn around. I see my mom standing there with the most disappointed look I have ever seen. I took out my headphones and asked what the hell just happened. She explained they just walked in to hear me sing that line, and then my girlfriend burst into tears and ran out. Shit. Turns out she left, and now she won't answer my calls or texts. I'll need to show her the song tomorrow at school. Hopefully she'll understand.... Hopefully.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been in one short relationship which was not anything serious at all. I see everyone around me having crushes/dating and I feel a bit left out. Someone even asked if I was asexual. I am just uncomfortable with being super-close, for example: holding hands, kissing, etc. I thought nothing of it, until a girl I had a crush on told me I wasn't datable because I won't do anything people in love do. I cried so hard after that. Like everyone else with mental health issues, I'm always told \"it will get better\", I'm almost a legal adult and nothing has changed. I am getting very depressed and feel hopeless, like no one will ever love me.

Yes I go to therapy, and yes I take medication. \n\nIn my short relationship I tried to do everything a normal person would do. I forced myself to hold hands, but my hands got very sweaty and I was uncomfortable. This person left me because I was too distant + not so mentally stable.

Did bowing my head at mealtimes really bother me that much? Etc. \n\nIn the end, I decided that I didn't care enough about the head bowing thing to go to war over it, but I just wasn't comfortable being \"required\" to attend and participate in church services that aren't my own. As for Santa et al, I explained as calmly and respectfully as possible that while I would never undermine her parenting, that I also wouldn't lie to my son, especially when my ex will be telling him the truth no matter what I do. He still loves Christmas and Easter egg hunts and all that (I mean, he's 3!) but he's taught that it's all pretend. \n\nHer response basically went like this:\n\n* How can we be a real family if you won't participate in our important traditions? You can't be a part of my family if you don't do this. (Church - Apparently it's an all day affair on holidays with services, bible study, and then kid activities). \n\n* We can't teach them two different things about Santa and I want them to believe as long as possible because it teaches valuable life lessons. (I think it teaches good behavior under threat of punishment... Sound familiar?)\n\nSo as you may have surmised, after lengthy discussion (read: argument) we decided that our values just don't match and we are splitting up. It's been a week since then. It's awful, and I'm taking it really hard (I'm avoiding going home and writing this because I don't know how to face her right now without getting upset). Losing the kids is the worst part, because we've been a family for a while now and it's hard to let that go. She's moving out and is supposed to be gone this week. So...yeah.\nTL;DR:"}

I was staying home alone for a week while my parents were on vacation. My friends had this \"amazing plan\" to scare the shit out of me. They were at my house and left one of my windows cracked so they could get back in later with airsoft guns and scare the living shit out of me in my sleep. I dropped them off and brought a lady friend over. They assumed I was asleep and 3 of them came over at around 1am. I was still wide awake and i hear the window and people whispering. I immediately get my shotgun and wait to see whats happening, my friend ill call him a racks his pistol. I go fucking crazy, im freaking out i have no idea what to do. Diddnt even think to call 911. I figure ill surprise them and hope I can shoot them first. I go downstairs and theyre in my den area, basically im around a corner and when i turn around it its a large room. I turn, gun pointed ahead of me, and basically come face to face with them, in my panic i point and pull the trigger. I realized at the last second it was pointed at my best friends face. There was no better sound ive ever heard in my life then the sound of the chamber being empty. In my panic i never loaded the gun. Now were sitting here dead silent like holy shit i just almost shot my friend, my friends white as a ghost he goes to throw up.

This guy has been doing this job by himself for several years and has to pass the torch onto me.  He's about 15-20 years older than me, I think.  He doesn't talk a lot about himself and I don't pry.  So we've been working closely for 4-5 months.  He's always been genuinely patient and kind with me.  Never losing his cool at any point, something I admire because in this job I would have lost it after someone like me asked the same question for the 5th time in a row.  He seemed like he was genuinely nice and liked to tease me for the fun of it.  He even told me that I can't quit because I'm too fun to tease.  Now, mind you, I'm in a long term relationship and didn't think much of any of this and didn't invest into it.  However, last week something changed and now it's awkward.  I don't know what happened. He's just stopped talking to me.  Whenever he talks to me, he's as stiff as a board.  Everything is ultra formal.  I just thought he was busy until today when I pass him, our eyes happen to meet and I smile and he didn't reciprocate.  It even appeared as though he was frowning.  I hear him talking to other coworkers and they seem on really good terms.  But he's not talking to me.  It's like a complete 180 and I don't know what to think of it because I have no choice but to work with him.  Thoughts?  Any similar experiences?\nTL;DR:"}

I was so wrong. \n\nTime passes by, we meet and have a couple of drinks, and then we come over to my place to start with the kinky stuff. \n\nI want you to imagine this: we go to my bedroom, I put a collar & handcuffs on him and make him undress me with his mouth only. The task was going well until he took my shoes off. He just stopped, stared at me, said the safe word and said \"I can't breathe, I'm sorry\".\n\nFor some weird reason, the lotion kind of... fermented? I have no fucking clue.

We rarely fight, we crave each others company, and we are both very serious about our relationship. \nThe only thing weighing us down are my jealousy issues. \n\nIt is impossible for me to go out ANYWHERE in public (groceries, the mall, the gym) without getting extreme paranoia that he is checking out other girls or thinking how attractive other girls are. When we are not together all I can think about is him looking at porn or gonewild posts on his computer. I can't even watch tv with him because whenever there is an attractive girl on the screen (which is often) I think that he is imagining having sex with her and lusting over her. I basically force us to only watch animated shows together because of this.. and even then the jealousy will still be there. \n\nHowever, I am painfully aware of how 'crazy' I'm being. I know that he would never cheat on me, and I know that its natural for people to find other attractive people attractive without it being a sign of infidelity. But knowing that does not stop the feelings of hurt and pain and paranoia.\n\nI have never been cheated on before, but I have witnessed my parents not being faithful to each other. Also, I worry that my self-esteem may be a cause of the issue. I try very hard with my appearance by working out, eating right, but it never feels like enough. \n\nI just want to be able to relax and enjoy a movie or a walk with my boyfriend. I love my boyfriend with my whole heart but the jealousy is honestly just too painful and damaging. I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

She has a lot on her plate at the moment- she has a very heavy workload from college, as well as a number of friends to keep in contact with.

I have no hate or dislike for OSx (other than it comes on machines that are very expensive), nor do I find Linux all that scary since that's what I use to compile code at my university.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because I'm in a bit of a debate with a friend who is harshly bashing Windows with no real backing and I'm wondering where this bias comes from. He's saying that Windows has no place and its only use is for Gaming and nothing else. I know Apple did that \"I'm a Mac, I'm a PC\" ad campaign which kind of brought about a lot of dislike for Windows, but a lot of those complaints are rather dated and go back to the Pre-XP era of Windows or can be attributed to completely ignoring antivirus protection and spam. \n\nI say this because the only people I've heard say they have had those problems (blue screens constantly, running slower than it should even though they have no gauge of how fast it should run, etc.) with Windows are people who never gave it a chance or tried to understand any of the causes. To top it all off, when their Macs fail they think it's some strange, awful, unique situation that doesn't happen very often, even though it's probably just as common as it is on a PC since they're both coded by humans and not gods with perfect foresight for every situation their OS could run into (I have no idea of statistics, so don't quote me and I'm fully open to being corrected).\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [28F] colleague [60sM] hits on me sometimes and I don't know what to do\nPOST: I'm 28F, and I look very young (mistaken for 18 often). I know this older colleague from a while back when I was starting out. He used to be nice but then he got divorced a couple years ago and turned creepy. His new lady friend is also 28F. \n\nThere have been situations where he's made sexual remarks towards  me in the guise of joking, and to be honest I didn't fully understand them because he's older than my father and English is not my first language (although I am almost natively fluent, so you can't tell). Then at the Christmas work party he hit on me quite strongly. I actually didn't take it seriously so I went along with it, but realized afterwards what was going on. I feel like he finds any opportunity to touch me. Which I would be okay with - I was born in Europe - but he does it creepily.\n\nThere has been no animosity and I do respect his work. He is also influential and has even offered to give me advice, like a mentor. It's very weird that he can separate the creepy behavior from professional behavior. When we discuss my work, he is very professional and not creepy, but at other times he makes very sexual jokes, and outside of work blatantly hits on me.\n\nI don't know what to do. I am concerned that the flirting etc will give me a bad name. Yet he is actually a helpful and useful person for my career, and is professional when I ask for help. At all other times, he is not. If other people are around, he is more reserved. I mostly act very innocent which actually shuts him down very well, mostly because I am a bit slow to understand really, which makes his sexual jokes fall flat.\nTL;DR:"}

It's really hard for me to get over zealous about things so it is very personal when I come to with things like that. All I will get from her is a smirk or a funny look, while she practically ignores me and moves on to something else. The same thing happens when I text her. I will get a \"Cool.\" or an \"Awesome babe.\"  When she tells me something and im all over it, I ask her questions and I am genuinely interested in what is making her excited and I try and find out more. \n\nLast night I voiced my concern to her and all she said was, \"sorry.\" I told her how it made me feel and that it is making me anxious to go to her with things that are exciting to me and problems that I have and that I am bottling them up when I should be sharing. All I asked her was to pay a little more attention to what I say and I try and be more interested in things that make me excited just like her. \n\nDid I over react or push her too much in telling her that?

So my now ex-girlfriend and I had broken up about 3 weeks ago because of how we were both busy and couldn't really see each other outside of school, but she was very indirect about it. (It ended in me thinking that we were just on a break but after a while, I figured out that by break she meant breaking up.) She still wanted to remain friends and walk with me to classes and chat and stuff.\n\nWell fast forward to two weeks after the break up (when I realized that she broke up with me and it wasn't just a break). I felt kind of overwhelmed and began to over-think things. A mutual friend had told me that she did the same thing to her last boyfriend (asking for space, saying that she wanted to get back together) but never did. This thought caused me to over-think even more and I felt utterly confused. So the following day, I asked my ex for some space, saying that I was going through some things.\n\nI quickly regretted it, I guess because of how foreign it felt and how I didn't fully understand the meaning of space until it was given to me. I tried talking to her 2 days after I asked for space to swallow my pride and ask for my friend back. But when I sat down with her to tell her, we kept being interrupted and I guess that point never got across. I feel so awkward with her now, since I see her everyday. \n\nI want to be on good terms with her, but I don't know how to get out of \"space\" and how to mend a friendship. She's a great person and I'd rather have a friend than no one at all. I just don't know what to do... \nAny advice would be very helpful, thank you for your time!\nTL;DR:"}

I was driving on the airfield (doing the daily inspection) and to no surprise, there was nothing good on the radio. Finally I came across the classical music station and said to myself \"aw what the hell\" and gave it a chance. \n\nSoon the orchestra that was currently playing had filled my mind and ears with amazing sounds. It was surprisingly catchy and I could imagine random scenes happening around me. For the past month I have been getting out of the office more and more conducting airfield checks and inspections simply to listen to the classical music station while driving.\n\nThe songs capture my imagination. With no words or singing, I can develop these amazing scenes in my head, everything from imagining a nice hike in the woods to a chaotic battle taking place. And other times it just relaxes me and creates a nice background noise to help me focus.\n\nThe reason I choose not to discus my newly found passion is because my egotistical co-workers will most likely make homosexual remarks or talk about how lame it is. My wife would just consider it boring and change the conversation. And friends, well the few I have at this base would probably just do the same thing as my co-workers.

We decided we would stay together until we had to leave for school, which is when we would break up.\n\nThroughout that time she would make little comments about \"how I am leaving her anyway\" and little things like that.

I have gone to the bar a few times myself and I actually really like the girl, she's very sweet. I don't feel jealously towards her at all. \n\nThe problem is that my husband wants to develop a friendship with this girl and has gotten her phone number and in my opinion, that's super innappropriate. I've seen their texts (through snopping, don't judge). In one message he says \"We should hang out more outside the bar, I bet if we did, we'd find we have more in common\". She immediately shot it down saying she didn't think I would like that. He then said, \"Yeah, I just meant as friends\". \n\nIs it just me or is that a suggestive text followed by damage control after getting shot down? I confronted him and he is adamant that he just wants to be friends with her, but even that seems inappropriate to me. He has a wife at home. Making friends with 20-something females doesn't seem good, does it? \n\nWhat are your opinions?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/weddingplanning\nTITLE: Does anyone else have unenthusiastic family? [Rant?]\nPOST: Fh and I have been together over 3 years, engaged since February and are planning a long engagement to be married in spring 2016.  We haven't done that much planning yet because we have been distracted by my graduation (next week), my finding a job (two job offers yay), finding a place for us to live near my new job, and fh transferring his job to the city we will be living in. He is very excited and has many crazy ideas, I'm not super into wedding stuff but I really like organizing and crafts so I'm sure it will come together. \n\nThe problem I am having is not really a huge problem but just kind of annoying I guess.  When we announced our engagement to my parents (we took them out to brunch to tell them) they basically said \"ok\" and then changed the subject.  I understand not everyone's big on weddings (myself included) and I wasn't expecting a huge reaction but I did expect something.  Since then my mom has only made a related comment like one time(about the ring fh had designed for me) and my dad has literally not mentioned a single thing related to it at all. My parents have been separated for many years and are amicable so I don't know that it's necessarily about that.  Perhaps it's just that it's so far out and we have literally nothing concrete planned yet, but it seems like lots of people have family that are really happy for them. I don't think my family dislike fh they just seem indifferent to the engagement.  Granted my sister is always very sweet about everything. \nOn the other hand when we told fh's parents they were super excited and immediately started asking us lots of questions (to which we didn't know the answers) so I know I'm not just imagining that this is a thing. \n\nOn the upside friends have been very excited and interested and fh is ahead of himself with crazy plans.\nTL;DR:"}

My parents are super supportive of what I do and I have this \"seminar\" of sorts I need to attend in Bombay so I'm heading there with 20 other people. The friend who's also coming used to work with me and is one of my best friends. But for my parents, boy best friend means boyfriend no matter how much I try to convince them. They don't have problems with me chilling with him here but if I can't have him over to my place alone so that's like the boundary. \n\nThe seminar starts on the 6th of the next month. Dates are 6th, 7th, 8th and I fly back on the 9th. My friend and I decided to head there a little early, on the 4th and have a mini-vacation. We've been planning it for about a month and everything seems fine...except I can't bring myself to book the tickets. \n\nI have NEVER lied to my parents about something so major. Even as a child my parents were never too overprotective, so I set boundaries for myself and maybe went over the edge sometimes but not in a major way like this. Since my dads booking the room for me at the hotel and he thinks my best friend, who's a girl, is going to be there but the truth is a 22 year old guy is going to be sharing a room with his daughter and I don't think if my parents find out they'll ever be able to trust me again. \n\n20 other people are going to get to Bombay on the 6th so basically the 4th and the 5th are the major lie days. I'm so anxious! It's 3 am here and I have a final tomorrow but I can't get this off my mind. Should I make something up and cancel the first three days with this guy? Should I grow a pair and just go? \n\nHelp.\nTL;DR:"}

First, I am 23 and she is 19 and we've been dating for over a year.  The biggest thing is that she doesn't want me discussing our relationship with anyone. ANYONE. If we have a fight and I'm upset, I'm not allowed to call even my parents to talk about it.  She found out I called my mom once after a fight and then got even more upset and now believes that my parents hate her (which they don't), and even after telling her that my parents don't hate her and that they probably understand that people in relationships have fights from time to time, she still won't believe me.  This is really the part that bothers me, I believe I should be able to talk to at least my parents about MY life. To make it worse, I found out she had talked to her friends about our relationship, which really doesn't seem fair at all.\n\nTo add to that, she never has anything nice to say about anyone.  She's always commenting on how ugly this girl is, or how gross this guy is, or how stupid her project teammates are, or how badly someone is dressed.  It's getting really irritating and I told her about her habit, which she responded by saying one nice thing the next day and then returning to her old ways.\nTL;DR:"}

Reddit, what's one of your worst nightmares that has almost become reality?\nPOST: This weekend I went on a 7 mile hike with my friend. We both drank quite a bit of water and were looking forward to using the restrooms back in the parking lot. These restrooms were your typical state park kind of restrooms - there was a single toilet seat above a deep hole in the ground, a tiny window that barely let in any light, and a heavy door that trapped all of the lovely smells inside. So, like any other person I quickly go in, lock the door, and go as fast as possible so I can escape the smell. I unlock the door and push on it to leave, but it won't budge. I try the lock again to make sure that the door is fully unlocked, but the door still won't budge. Luckily, my friend was waiting outside, so I called to her and asked her to help. After she stifled her laughter over the situation, she begins to pull on the door while I push as hard as I can. It was around this time that the horror sunk in - I might actually be stuck in this dark, stinky, bathroom for an extended period of time! After struggling for some time we were finally able to get the door open. Nightmare escaped.\nTL;DR:"}

This has never been a problem for me, and I would consider us both attractive. I thought she just wasn't in the mood often but her saying she is attracted to other people kinda changes things. She was a virgin when we met, so it could be that after the year we've been dating I'm just not as exciting as some guy at a 4th of July party.\n\nI kinda freaked out and she said that she wasn't even going to bring it up, it was just some thing she had been worrying about. We discussed breaking up, but neither of us wanted that.

I have never been in a situation like this before.\nI 23F and 23M have been dating for around 4 months now. When we first starting seeing each other we would have sex or at least mess around every time we hung out (3 - 4xs a week). Around the 3rd month he started having issues with staying erect during sex, or foreplay.\n\nCut to now. we only have sex maybe once every week at the moment. I know that this has only been happening for a month, but to me that is really hard. I have a relatively high sex drive, and it really is one of the things that makes me feel intimate with a SO.\nWe have talked about it a lot and I know he is currently really stressed due to trying to change jobs and having to study to qualify for the job he wants to get. He also has said that he is putting a lot of pressure on himself when we try to have sex which makes it hard to get into it because he doesn't want to disappoint me. He's just never in the mood anymore. The 1 or 2 times that we have done it recently have just been randomly in the middle of the night--maybe he just feels less stressed then? Anyone else experience this?\n\nI have told him that sex is an important part of the relationship for me and he is asking if I can just be patient while he works through these things. I guess I am just having trouble with this. When you constantly get rejected for sex, it gets more and more hard to initiate or try to be intimate especially since I don't want to be the person putting more stress or pressure on him.

He was really normal but his whole kindergarten-senior years were spent with a drunk dad, a bitchy sister, and an uncaring mom. I should add that he spent most of his time with me and my family. Ever since he graduated highschool, he \"woke up,\" yeah, that familiar phrase. If any of you guys out there know any conspiracies or anything political, he talks about topics like: Alex Jones, New World Order, liberals are satan, media is meant to fool us (kinda agree with that one tho), and 1984 will happen when Obama leaves office. One thing he keeps saying is that Obama was elected to give the blacks some comfort while it hides the fact that the \"rap-game\" takes over and makes black people kill eachother. That last stuff really scares me. He moved to live with his grandparents about a year ago in another state. I thought that would help him, but his grandparents are GOP-radical type people so...yeah. \nEvery time I say something to him he always responds with the same sort of mumbo-jumbo about how all-my-friends-know-it-so-it-must-be-true, BS.\n\nI have tried to reason with him, but as my dad puts it, conspiracy theorists will always win. I don't think I can help him at this point. I personally feel one reason he's acting like this can be related to the quote \"idle hands are the devil's playground.\"\n\nAny advice you have is welcome!\nTL;DR:"}

In general, when we talk, things are also good.  We don't fight, and there's usually not any tension.  At the same time, we're not committed to each other, and are free to date other people, with an understanding that we'd be open and talk about if one of us started seriously dating someone else or something.  And I trust him that he would. \n\nThen he dropped this on me, and I really don't know how to take it.  He's saying it's because he doesn't know how his roommates would take me staying there for that long.  What?  I mean, I've had so many different kinds of roommates, and none of them would have ever had any issue whatsoever with a friend from across the country coming to stay for less than a week.

To the point where it would be maybe once every 2-3 weeks. I've talked to her multiple times about how I'd like to have sex more but it always boils down to her being too tired, not feeling pretty, not clean, not in the mood, etc.\nShe does have difficulty reaching orgasm without a bullet but I never fail to get here there whenever we have it on hand.\n\nLately I haven't been suggesting or instigating sex and waiting for her to do it. Generally she just teases me or riles me up then says she's not in the mood. It's frustrating.\n\nAlthough I would like to have sex 1-2 times a day I'm completely reasonable when it comes to a realistic amount.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I thought I could afford college, but I'm afraid I messed up. Help?\nPOST: I'm afraid I've gotten myself into a bad situation.\nBackground: My parents live on the other side of the country, and I moved by myself back to the Northwest where we all used to live. I support myself, and have managed an AA degree so far by doing two years at community college on a Pell grant. \nThe unfortunate thing about living on my own and doing the whole college experience on my own is that I found out the hard way that there were things I didn't know about private loans. I got accepted into a local private university-its pretty expensive, but because both my parents and I make very little, I get lots of financial aid, and I figured I could just take out a student loan. I started to apply for the loan, and realized that I need a cosigner. My parents don't want to cosign on a loan because they don't want to be responsible for my debt (even though I tried to assure them that I would make it my responsibility.) I found this out about a week before school started. Now I have an owing balance with the school, and I have a financial hold on my account, meaning I can't register for classes next semester and they won't release my transcripts. I've already applied to a cheaper school, and I'm hoping I get accepted there and can transfer after fall quarter is over, BUT they're going to want transcripts of this school, and as far as I know they won't release them until the owing balance is paid. The exact amount is unclear (they just selected me for financial aid verification, so part of my funds are also on hold) but I believe it's about $5,000 that I still need. I could really use suggestions, because I need somewhere to live and go to school up here. What are my chances of being approved for a loan without a co-signer? Is it worth a shot? Any good resources for scholarships or some sort of academic funding? I've thought about trying fastweb, but it seems like with all the competition on that site it might not be worth my time.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My BF [M/23] of a year admitted to trying to hook up with my [F/23] best friend [F/21], I feel like it's my fault\nPOST: We dated for about 8 months during our senior year of college. I broke up with him before I left undergrad to pursue graduate school in another state. He offered to move with me but I said no, because I knew deep down that although I loved him, he wasn't the one for me. We maintained contact and were basically dating even after the breakup. Then we tried to go no-contact for a bit, but would slip up from time to time. Finally over winter break I returned home (where he is) and we decided to give it another chance. \n\nI think I was ready to try because the things I didn't like about him before (what made me think he wouldn't be the one I'd end up with) weren't as important as they were. Those things are his lack of future ambition, lack of interest in intellectual topics, lack of motivation to pursue goals, and incredible impulsive behaviors. I thought that I could get past those, because we have a lot of fun and I know he loves me. Then, only two weeks into our second try, he calls me and tells me that he has been asking one of my best friends (who still lives in his state) if she wants to hook up with him. It turns out she does have feelings for him, but she said no. When I was upset he apologized, but then suddenly he switched moods. He said that I had been putting pressure on him, and that I would pick fights over nothing (somewhat true - I was not myself in the relationship), and he didn't know how to handle his stress. The thing is - I want to believe that. I want to believe that the person I fell for would never do something so terrible to me, but I also am wondering if that's really why he did it.\nTL;DR:"}

Growing up, even though his birth-father was out of the picture at a young age, he was always a sexual being. \n* He's more promiscuous than he should be, and he has a tendency to flirt with girls, including flirting in a sexual way. He's toeing the line of being unfaithful with different things he's done (he has not physically done anything with anyone during our relationship, and the height of his unfaithfulness has been acquiring nude photos from girls. Not everyone sees this as cheating, and I'm not quite sure where I stand, myself). \n* I know he loves me, and I truly believe him. To him, from the way he explains it, sex and love just aren't the same thing to him. Sex can be incorporated in love, but sex doesn't necessarily mean love. To him, he has those sexual urges that seem to overpower his common sense, more like a primal instinct than anyone else. \n* I don't know how much of these problems I can attribute to him just being a dumbass, or how much I can attribute them to stemming from a psychological issue from childhood sexual abuse. \n* Either way, I don't quite know how to deal with all of this.

It feels like they're a complete mess when I'm not around, so cutting them out completely isn't an option.  So how do I stay true to myself while still maintaining relationships?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [30 M] broke up with my cheating [24F] girlfriend and I'm devastated. How do I cope/get over it? Please help me.\nPOST: [Original Post:](\n\nShe told me 2 weeks ago that she had a drunken romp with a friend of hers about 2 months ago. Me being the angry 'never cheated once' type, I ended it with her.  I felt bad about the things I said and talked to her about it a week ago for closure.  I made the mistake of kissing her when she asked for it.  Since then she has been apologetic telling me she is in love with me.  This frustrated me more, so saturday I met her to give her all her things and request that she delete my number in front of me.  After doing so, I felt great.  But the reality of it being over has set in today.  I can't stop thinking about her and the good times we had.  I can't let it not effect my work life.  I have seen a therapist and am seeing one tomorrow.  Everything, no matter how insignificant triggers it.\n\nSadly, this on again/off again relationship of 8 months has been the closest I have ever been in my 30 years of life to reaching love (which could be a naive delusion I am having).  But it has been the farthest I've progressed in a relationship.  She kept asking for more of me and I hesitated, but ended up giving her nearly all of myself.  I feel like I cant find that again.  I feel so insecure and devastated.  I know damn well that this woman is not right for me, but I am bargaining with myself.  Considering contacting her again even though all logic and sense says not to.  I've also sworn her off in the past and reached back out to her after 3 months, and I'm afraid I'll do that again.  I know this is very common in this world and could even be much worse, so I would love to hear from those with experience.  I've been having trouble breathing normally all day.  I feel like an immature teenager.  Please help me.\nTL;DR:"}

She says I had nothing to do with breakup, which is part true part false (you can ask more about that in the comments), so, right now we're FWB but not really, because it's not just casual sex, we're bffs but with added casual sex, so we're more than FWB but not in a relationship.\n\nNow, we have talked and she made it clear she didn't want anything and that we're not exclusive, I'm okay with that, but I really want her to be my gf, of course I haven't told her because that would ruin everything.\nTL;DR:"}

We spent the weekend together last weeked. No sex or kissing. She told me she loved me a couple times but said she wants to \"do her\" for awhile. \nThis week at work was terrible as the office mma douche began to pursue her heavily. Lost of instant messaging and txting her. I over heard him calling her at 9 am in the breakroom on her day off. I suffer from anxiety and ocd so I lost it and confronted him. I was very calm about the whole thing while talking to him but he immediately threatened me to a fight. \nI told her about the incident. She said it's my fault because I have not accepted that they are over. I said if she wanted to keep me in her life as a friend then she has to stop contact with him. As i would do if anyone I knew threatened her regardless if she was wrong.

I would like somewhere to start and go from there and I think my health insurance is most important at this point. I can upload a picture of more detailed options tonight when I get home from work if that would help but to put it very shortly my choices are between a Health Reimbursement Account or a Health Savings Account.

Two blonde haired light eyes beauties that might not be slam dunks but damn were they enticing. My roommate and I have cooked up fantasy after fantasy with these two and we've just been pussy footing around pretending they'd totally be into hooking into us, despite them both being in relationships( and Us As well at the time). Anyways, fast forward to tonight and they both come over to my apartment. My roommates at work but they each have a bottle and don't wait for him, and so we start pounding shots. So I'm texting my roommate and he doesn't believe me. He's working on the other side of town and has to see for himself, so he's rushing home while I'm getting good and plastered with these two girls. They both start alternating bathroom breaks being girls and their dumb bladders so each one is one on one with me one after another. They Sachs tart to come onto me. Hard. One girl is already starting to feel me up, but I know my roommate prefers her over the other girl for his own reasons, so I don't want to leave him with nothing to look forward to. So me being generous, I talk my roommate up to one of them to give him something to look forward to when he comes home, just to mess around you know? Nothing's gonna come of it. \n\nMy roommate gets home and quickly catches up in the Smirnoff Olympics, and that's when she drops the bomb. The one I've been wing-manning HARD for my roommate says she has a secret. She's been single for months and has had a hard on for both of us. And since my roommate was \"such a great guy\" she just jumped for it and lo and behold, they're on the other side of my wall fucking each other's brains out while I listen and pretend to do calculus homework. Oh and the other girl got sick and went home.\nTL;DR:"}

I (25 m) travel a lot for work and am constantly in hotel rooms and hotel bars and usually I am alone. This week I was lucky in the fact that I had a young female co-worker from a different country come work on a project we had. So as you can imagine, we were 2 young people drinking in a hotel thousands of miles from home and one thing led to another and we started to hook up. It was fun and awesome and before we knew it we were sleeping in the same bed every night. One day (this morning) we had sex and I went to go take a shower before we headed in to the office. This is where things headed south.\nI went ahead and closed the door (I didn't lock it.. who would?) and ran the shower. Hopped into the shower and really needed to have my post-sex pee session so I said 'Fuck it' and started to unleash this massive stream of the yellowest most powerful piss I had ever had in my life. What happened next you ask?\n\nSHE RAN IN TO THE SHOWER TO JOIN ME. She jumped into the shower and hugged me while I continued to piss. She stood in my puddle of the darkest most potent piss I think I had ever taken. She got a little on her legs because I couldn't stop myself fast enough.\n\nONCE SHE REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED it was over. She started to freak out, she called me nasty, disgusting, saying \"what is wrong with you???!!!\" , the works and ran out of the bathroom.\n\nSo I finished my shower, got dressed, and now i'm sitting here at the office just waiting for her to walk in and give me the most disgusted look of \"I stepped in your piss and got some on my leg and now we have to work together\". \n\nThankfully I fly back home to NY today and hopefully won't have to work with her for quite some time (or ever again.)\nTL;DR:"}

Since I was maybe 7 or 8, I have been masturbating \u2013 I am twenty-one now. I masturbate about two-three times a day, with most of them coming (excuse the pun) before bed. Always having trouble sleeping, and I find that by doing this, I am better able to rest.\n\n I have a beautiful girlfriend of six years that helps me (we have sex three-four times a week), yet I feel as though she cannot keep up. I have exceptional stamina and when I climax, I am usually looking for more within five to ten minutes. Although this is a problem, it is by no means an excuse to get rid of her. Any replies concerned with me ending the relationship will be ignored; I love her very much and I don't believe that my level of arousal is grounding enough to do so. \n\nThat said, it has gotten to the point where I lie in bed for about three hours before falling asleep (she has the \"bed hit pillow = unconscious gift\"). I masturbate beside her, before sleeping yet I harbour feelings of sadness be it because I have a woman beside me while doing so, or because I have to do this in order to get any rest). \n\nI admit I get extremely frustrated sometimes when she does not feel like putting out \u2013 and we've had our little spats about it, but I understand that I am not very ordinary in my wants and ultimately it is my fault.\n\nIs this simply some sort of conditioned response due to my many years of masturbating \u2013 and thus there's no hope for my eternal boner, or is there an underlying cause to all of this?

We love each other and we're good to each other. He wants to move us forward but I just can't get over this nebulous anxiety about locking myself into one path for life and potentially missing out on what could have been.

I look at him sometimes and it's like I'm seeing a friend more than a romantic partner. Part of me is convinced that's pretty natural after 3 years, but it still freaks me out.\n\nAll this angst and ambivalence seems to be coming to a head. I am not a sentimental person, RA.

She has been in a couple of very long relationships, is unemployed and is out with girlfriends a couple times a week partying or having drinks.

She sees the differences and i told her that it makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nWe hung out a lot this month. I have had no structure or sleep because we were having sex all night plus i'm not used to sleeping with somebody next to me.

Before this we had never met. My question comes in two parts.\n\nThe first part begins here. The user pulled me to another channel and we had a sexually explicit conversation (like phone sex in her words). In the course of this, I asked for a photo of her person (through Teamspeak). When I asked \"Do you have a photo or something?\" I was expecting a normal picture of her, but clearly I did not consider the context and she set her avatar to an explicit photo of herself. Not knowing her age, I screen-capped the avatar and put it through multiple search engines hoping to find out if she was using pictures from the web.\n\nAfter some time she told me that she was 17. I deleted the screenshot immediately thereafter.\n\nWe continued to communicate through [Steam] and Teamspeak, the nature of the communications being like so:\n\n>Person: \\*Poke\\*  \n>DerniereChance: Hi  \n>Person: \\*Lays against you\\*  \n>DerniereChance: You're friendly today. \\*Wraps arms around you\\*\n\nThe second part begins here. I invited her to another Teamspeak server after she was banned from the previous one for what transpired in the first part. On this server, we did not have sexually explicit conversations. However, she once again did set her avatar to a sexually explicit image for a brief period of time before setting it to a non-sexually explicit image of herself.\n\nAfter she left, other users began discussing the legal ramifications of her actions.

Not sure if its relevant, but we moved across the country for grad school, so we don't have any good friends/family and we've relied pretty heavily on each other for emotional support.\n\nA few months ago I started noticing that she was sometimes sad for no reason and would not tell me why. I assumed that she was missing her friends/family so I planned some day trips for us to take together, encouraged her to try and meet more people (go to parties, etc.), surprised her with flowers, etc. During this time, we also started having sex less and less.\n\nA couple weeks ago we had a much more honest conversation and she told me that her feelings for me have changed and she's not sure if she loves me any more. She still cares for me, but she sees me as a friend, not a boyfriend. She said her feelings started changing in February and she doesn't know why. There's no specific event that caused the change.

He has friends at work but he never hangs out with him, after I tell him he should have guy time. \n\nLast night out of the blue he tells me that he isn't happy. That he loves me but he can't give me what I want; marriage and children. He broke up with me. He text messaged me this morning saying that it isn't easy for him and that he still cares for me. I just don't understand what I did to make him so unhappy. When I asked him, he said it is nothing I did or didn't do. \n\nI am just so confused. I live in a very expensive apartment and I have no family or friends here. We still live together but I am sure that is changing soon. What do I do to get over it and stop crying non-stop? I haven't eaten or slept since he broke up with me last night.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not an emotional guy. But I'm feeling feelings for my current bf [51M], during my divorce. I've been separated from my wife for 2 years. This has almost nothing to do with the fact that he's clearly a man. I'm open about dating him, and all of my friends and family are cool. We've been together for 10 months, and it has been the easiest and most wonderful relationship I've ever been in. He's ridiculously phenomenal, not 'woo, I'm having sex!' phenomenal, but really... I wish I'd married him first. I'm literally 4 months from finalizing the divorce with my wife. He wants to lock it down. I want to lock him down, seriously. Jeezus. What the hell. Logic says that it's WAY too soon for something like this.  Emotions suck. Please help me with perspective.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: My friends horribly unfortunate medical debt situation.\nPOST: This might be the wrong subreddit and for that I apologize in advance. I would like to start by saying I really tried to Google this, but its a pretty specific situation. I am not 100 percent clear on the details as I don't want to come across as too nosey, but this sounds too shady for me to not try and help. \n\nMy friend moved out of state for a few years and got extremely ill a few days before she was supposed to come home. She went to the hospital feeling very weak where she was basically told nothing serious was wrong with her. They suggested some over the counter medication and sent her on her way. She drove about 10 hours home(miraculously), and upon entering her house her mom immediately forced her to go back to the hospital. This time the doctor was able to recognize the symptoms, and prescribed her the appropriate antibiotics. The doctor also noted that a few more days without professional attention and her body may have actually shut down. \n\nNow im not too sure on how the medical expenses break down between the two hospitals, but she ends up 9k in debt because she has no medical insurance. Is there anything that can be done? It seems pretty asinine that a hospital can charge you thousands of dollars for a misdiagnosis, especially one that severe. Maybe im just that naive though...\nTL;DR:"}

The title is pretty self explanatory.\n\nWhen I was about 3 years old, my mother took my me shopping to Asda (UK Walmart). I was always looking to play with people in my young age and I found a kid in the store to play with so I started to run towards him. However, when I ran to play with my new friend a horrifying revelation was made.\n\nThe \"kid\" was not in fact a kid but instead, was a male dwarf. From this, my father had to try and explain to me that his dwarf in his mid-30s was not in fact a new friend but a man that I wasn't allowed to play with while also trying to contain his laughter.\n\nAs you can imagine, the dwarf was probably quite scared, you know what with a hyperactive 3 year-old boy chasing him around Asda trying to play with him.\n\nLooking back, we always laugh when the topic is brought up.\nTL;DR:"}

There was this awesome band playing that the whole audience was really getting into. During the show there was this really cute girl next to me the whole time that I ended up dancing with a little bit.\n\nAfter the band was done playing, me and my friends were walking away, and the cute girl I mentioned was walking towards me. We made eye contact and she smiled, stopped to talk to me, and said \"hey\". This is where I fucked up.\n\nFor some reason, my brain didn't really register what was happening, and i just walked right by her. When I was about 5 feet away, I thought \"Oh shit she wants to talk to you! say something!\". Now I turn my head towards her to say hey back, but my legs still kept walking away. Also, instead of actually saying \"hey\", I looked at her and made a loud noise along the lines of \"Heeaaaauuugh-ayy!\".\n\nAfter this happened, we both just looked at each other, then turned around and walked away. We both kept looking over our shoulders at each other, and kind of hesitating from walking away, wondering if we should attempt to salvage the scenario. But nope, we left that situation alone.\nTL;DR:"}

Long story short, even though she repeatedly agreed to hang out she kept ditching me.\n\nTonight, it all came out because we were supposed to hang out and I drove to her house only to find out that she wasn't there and hadn't really planned to hang out.  I knew she had lied about why we weren't hanging out and I stupidly vented to her parents about it.\n\nWhen I returned home and basically threatened to cut her out of my life entirely, she freaked and wanted to talk right away.  I agreed and we talked.  I thought things were good, because we worked out our problems and it looked like we could at the very least be friends still.\n\nProblem is, as soon as she got home her parents went off on her.  It seems that they believed every word I told them about her lying to me and took that to mean that she was lying to them and was therefore a horrible person.  Now they won't talk to her at all.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask of Reddit is advice on how to try and fix her relationship with her parents now.  It's my fault that things ended up this way, and I feel that it should be my job to at least try and fix it.\n\nI know I was rather vague.

It's never been bad, it's sort a light crush, but, lately it's gotten bad. She's dropped a few hints that suggest to me she wants a relation. Anywhere from flirting with me, to hugging me.\n\nWhat truly made me stop and think she may have feelings for me was when she and I were talking late one night. We described what we wanted to do once our senior year was done. She was going off to College out of state, and then we got into the subject of romance. She began describing her \"prince charming\", and oddly said Prince fit my personality to a T, hell even my description sorta.  \n\nI joked with her that her ideal guy sounded sorta like me. She laughed and told me how oddly coincidental and she wonders what it means. She didn't elaborate further, but, for her tone and the way she looked at me, I got the feeling she meant me.\n\nAhhh, but, what if I'm just being egotistical and beleiving what I want to hear? She's never before made any sort of romantic gesture towards me and since that night she's not done any \"flirting\" or elaborated further.

My wife and I were staying with my parents as we had just moved out of our apartment, and we were going to move into a new one. Anyway, we were staying in the basement bedroom as it was the largest, was out of everyone's way, and was pretty soundproof. Being this secluded, we fucked the shit out of each other. My little garbage can next to my bed was filled to the brim with used condoms.\n\nNow, all of my nephews were over one day, and they LOVE their uncle Cyram. I mean, I am the coolest guy in the world to these kids and they want to come right to my room and play my video games and talk to me. One of my nephews, who was seven at the time, I think, is curious about all of these things were in my trash can. I didn't notice it soon enough, but he picks one up and holds it above his head as he's walking to me asking \"Uncle Cyram, what's this?\" and I watch in horror as a glimmering glob of my chromosomes falls right onto his face. \n\nThis is when my sister (his mom) walks in, and both of us stand there, moths agape at the sight of this. We hesitated longer than we should have, but we got him cleaned up very quickly and laughed about the whole thing. Honestly, I can't wait until he's in his late teenage years so I can tell him all about this! Needless to say, I still tie my condoms up to this day! My nephews still come over to my house to visit so I have to be sure this NEVER EVER happens again!\nTL;DR:"}

We do not live together but he spends most of his spare time at mine. I buy and cook at least 80% of the food here which he eats, but I don't mind that part too much. I'm starting to feel a little irritated by his willingness to go out, but unwillingness to pay for doing so. Say for example, he will suggest ordering a pizza or going out for a meal. I am usually pretty agreeable (this may be the source of my issue in some ways) and will go along with it. He will almost always leave me to pay the bill; in a pizza place and they ask for money? He will walk off. He wants to go to events/concerts? He will get me to get the tickets and then never pay me back. Sometimes tickets are upwards of $80 each. My family have noticed that he isn't willing to pay for drinks on nights out and will just wait for others to pay for them instead. I find this embarrassing. It isn't that he doesn't have the money, he would just rather not spend it. He grew up in a household which was dirt poor and I know this probably heavily influenced his financial habits.\n\nI am naturally pretty giving and not frugal, I am also not good at confrontation and would feel uncomfortable arguing about this so I just feel like I'm getting resentful. How do I go about getting him to pay his own way?\nTL;DR:"}

How can I help her build more courage and initiative?\nPOST: We've been together for around 10 months and are pretty serious. There is a lot of love and good times. There have also been many disagreements. As an example, disagreements tend to come when we have plans to meet up, and she says she can't because she has to go clean her room. Unfortunately we're both really busy, and probably wouldn't be able to meet up for another week so I suggest (not angrily) that she could clean her room a time other than when we had agreed to meet up. She then gets really mad, saying I'm pressuring her and usually there's nothing I can do/say to change her mind. A couple times I've gotten fed up and very mad, and it's convinced her, but I don't want to make her do things, at the same time, we need to have more seriousness about commitments to plans. \n\nI know there's underlying issues with her family who pressure her a lot, and her mother always wants her to be home when she's not at work. Her family is Indian and in a very tightly knit community and I'm white. They don't know about me because my girlfriend thinks they'll hate me because I'm not from their community and lock her up in the house if she tells them. \n\nIt's a complicated situation, I know there's a lot of pressure on her, I want to be able to help her to help loosen up her parents but it's hard because they're very oppressive and controlling and I can't do anything indirectly. Her mother uses guilt a lot to make her do things. She'll sometimes cry for hours when my girlfriend won't do something she wants her to, telling her she's putting her in so much pain and how could she be so negligent of her own parents and family. Usually it's for something as simple as my girlfriend wanting to go visit another city for the weekend.

She has come a long way in class and gotten better in the house, but it is such slow going outside. We use a lot of the \"nothing in life is free\" approach inside the home to build self control and incorporate a lot of \"tricks\" while playing fetch so she has to work for the throw. Her self control has gotten better, but everything went out the window during our training session yesterday. It was an hour of frustration for her and I ended up in tears for longer afterwards.\n\nWe met with a trainer and her dog to see if we could get them to calmly meet on leash and have them play to teach her better habits around dogs.  We couldn't get within 30 ft without her losing her shit yesterday and this is after she has been able to meet dogs right through a fence at RR.  As long as the dog was in sight she was in an excited state and would barely listen to me. She doesn't have great leash control as it is, but this was a full hour of her trying to pull my arm out of socket even if I was 100 feet away from the other dog.\n\nI feel like we've made such little progress with all the hundreds of dollars I've spent on training and it has all been for virtually nothing.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it because I have never been so disappointed or felt so hopeless in our training.  She has met and played with dogs in an indoor playgroup and does fairly well, she just has no self control and doesn't give a shit about anything else other than her tunnel vision when outside. I've found one treat she is willing to take after trying pretty much everything, and it seems like she only takes it because I want her to.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: Should I pay to break the lease since I'm the one leaving?\nPOST: Female, 24, broke up with Male, 28, after 3 years. We've lived together for two years. We moved out of a cheap, shitty, month-to-month place into a nice place with a year lease. Three months in and I am more unhappy than ever and have decided to move back home and break it off with him. We still live together pretty civilly for now. We've been friendly, semi-still acting like we're in our relationship while we both figure out the moving situation.\n\nHe just realized today that we would be splitting the cost of breaking the lease, rather than me paying the full cost by myself. I have a full-time steady job, but I make about $200 a week. His job is not steady--though he always seems to find work--and he makes about $600 a week. Rent is $850 a month. \n\nI argued that he can afford to live here without me, thus it is his decision to break the lease, which costs $1000. I am more than happy to split the cost, but he thinks I should pay in full, because I am technically breaking the lease by leaving, since my name is on the lease. \n\nI don't think this is fair. We have always split the rent and bills perfectly even, even though he makes a lot more money than I do. Even if he is unable to find work for a period, he can file and receive unemployment for that time, and he also has a savings of about $6,000 that he can pull from.\nTL;DR:"}

He definitely is the kind of person who enjoys having time to himself, and time with his friends, but he enjoys spending time with me too, which makes this all very confusing. He says that he still loves me, which is true (he's not just being nice about the break up) and I still love him. We are pretty darn awesome together. \n\nBut he is also in crisis about commitment. His belief is that we either have to break up now, or we'll end up getting married and being together forever. Now, this is not something I ever talk about, or push for. In fact, any time we've ever spoke about moving in together, or getting married, it's been him that's suggested it. TBH I don't even think about marriage etc at this age.\n\nWe're on a break at the moment, just to give him some time to himself. I'm willing to give him more time by himself or with friends to make it feel like the relationship isn't suffocating him. \n\nIt feels like the idea of being together for a year is giving him cold feet about relationships in general.

This is currently my 2nd bought with this affliction in the past 6 months.\n\nThe first time I went to the gym hungover and dehydrated and worked out way to hard on my arms. The next 3 day they proceeded to blow up like balloons so naturally I checked myself in at the ER to only find out my Creatine Kinase (CK) levels were at 40,000. Normal is 100-300. I was also told my liver levels were a little elevated. So I spent 5 days getting pumped with IV to lower my CK down to 5000 where I was told I could go home and just take it easy and drink tons of water for 2 weeks.\n\nFast-forward 3 months later I am getting ready to start P90x. The first day consisted of arms and chest. I do said exercises making sure I am drinking A TON of water. The next day my right arm is a little swollen. Being paranoid I immediately think it is Rhabdo again and go to the hospital. When I am admitted my CK is at 11,500. I again am told my liver levels are elevated. In specific my alkolase. I get pumped with fluids and then am discharged 5 days later.\nTL;DR:"}

My CC is tied to the same bank that my ex-wife and I set up our 2 kids savings account.  So when I went to look at my statement I noticed that the kids accounts were low, I mean really low.  \n\nI started investigating and I discovered large withdrawals starting in early 2015.  I texted her asking if she knew anything about these withdrawals, and if not we have a problem.  She said she did those.  I asked her if there were large kid expenses  that she didn't tell me about.  She said some but mostly for bills and prepping the house for sale, but she was going to pay them back.  She has pulled out 2K per account so total of 4K from both accounts.  I've since closed both accounts and reopened new ones in just my name so that she can't pull any more money out.\n\nShe has a 6 figure job, 15+K in child support, a credit card to put kid expenses that I pay for.  So she is not hurting for money.\n\nSo options:\n\n1.  Have a note drawn up with a payment plan where she will pay the kids back the money she took\n\n2.  Let her open savings account under her name for the kids and she can put money in those. (not a fan of this one)\n\n3.  Just forget that she will ever pay it back and move forward.\n\nSo redditors what should I do?  I'm pretty upset that she viewed the kids savings account as her personal piggy bank to make withdrawals when she needed it.\nTL;DR:"}

In doing so, he told me and my parents that he was going to see a movie and have dinner \"with friends.\" I knew that it was a date because my gf (Ana) is close friends with Dan. \n\nFast forward another couple weeks and Cole tells me that he is going to his friends house for the afternoon. No big deal. I hear from Ana that he was actually out with Dan again. My mom also believed that he was at another friend's house. \n\nLast Tuesday Ana tells me that Cole talked to our parents, and that my dad was cool and supportive, but my mom was a little uncertain. She just told me again today that my mom is becoming more ok with it all. \n\nDespite what I've heard from my gf who I love and trust, I still have a feeling that he didn't talk to our parents.

I happened to meet my current man by chance 4 months ago and we had an instant connection. I feel real potential with this guy and see a future wirh him. He seems uncomfortable about my recent divorce and he said he hasn't thought about the future for us yet (marriage) because it's too close to my divorce. I was very hurt by this since he asked me to move across the country to be with him in about 3 months.  We have a very new relationship but we've found a niche that's perfect for us. We're extremely comfortable together and things are great. I love him but we have yet to exchange it verbally. This is where I get anxiety because I felt my ex never fully committed to me and I need my BF to say this to me before I commit to moving. This has caused me to have a meltdown and cry twice in front of him. I would hate to move for a man who may not be totally serious about me. I don't need a ring before I move but it'd be nice to know that I'm more important than \"just some girl\".  He's adamant that I am but I really need this verbalized. What can I do in this situation? I potentially won't have a job waiting for me in this new place and that is causing a lot of stress for me, although he does not seem to be concerned that I'll remain unemployed. He seems so calm about all this but I'm more and more worried. I believe he loves me but I'm too afraid to say it first on the chance that he doesn't... Im a pretty anxious person so this has been causing me a lot of anxiety recently. Most days I have zero problem moving because he's exactly what I want in a man and life partner.

I have about 5 years of relevant experience now. However, my most recent contract ended in August and I've had to take on a casual labor (landscaping) position to make ends meet. I don't mind the hard work at all and I see it as just a stop-gap measure while I look for another job in my field.\n\nThe problem: I never imagined that this situation would be a professional problem. Since my last contract ended, I've continued to go to events and network in my field while I look for a new job. I've started to find that when I tell other professionals that I'm landscaping now that many of them have the same reaction: raised eyebrows, surprise and disapproval. \n\nThe worse problem: I've had two interviews recently and both of them asked what I was doing now. When I told them I'm a landscape laborer they both had the same reaction: raised eyebrows and a quiz about why I'm doing that and why I'm applying to their organization. \n\nIt's humiliating and discouraging to have other professionals in my field disapprove of what I have to do to make ends meet.

After that we'd like to head northward towards the Lapland region.\n\nWe'd like to explore the different cultures as we work our way up and possibly get a chance to do some scenic hiking. A few of us are into folk and metal music, somehow over the years I've gotten to know more Finnish bands than English ones.. checking out some live music would definitely be on our list. Local food stops and markets would be good too =D\n\nWe're all students so don't have a huge amount to spend on travel and accommodation, looking at Hostels mainly. Would bus/coach services be a good way to get around?\n\nWe're up for some pretty ridiculous adventuring so wondering how far north we can go? Is there much to see if we were to cross up into Norway? Our main concerns are airport connections. So far from my research, Ivalo airport seems a safe bet with flights back to the UK available for \u00a3150 - \u00a3200.\n\nAny ideas would be appreciated, we're still in the early stages of planning so nothing is set in stone yet, hope to book rally and flights within a couple weeks though.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by offending a Jewish coworker with an accidental holocaust reference\nPOST: So I was in a standard office meeting with a Jewish coworker and for some reason we got on the topic of the new interns and the cubes that they had to sit in. These cubes are extremely tiny, square, and provide only enough space to look straight forward, hands on keyboard, that's it. They are like little claustrophobic concentration chambers. In fact, one could say they are even \"concentration cubes\", which is precisely the term I decided to use.\n\n\"Concentration cubes\" - what a f*cking idiot. \n\nI said this phrase a few times before abruptly stopping when my brain made the connection. I think I even at one point said we're \"forcing our interns to work\" in these tiny \"concentration cubes\" or something like that. \n\nIMPORTANT: I WASN'T trying to make any sort of holocaust reference, it was simply an adjective I chose to describe the cube and it wasn't until a few moments later that I realized it was very, very close to the phrase \"concentration camp\". Not sure if he realized this was unintentional or not, but he certainly picked up on the connection. It was quiet. After a moment or two of awkwardness we just sort of moved on talking about normal office stuff. Good job, me.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [18 F] don't feel as committed to [18 M] boyfriend\nPOST: I guess that's to be expected at this age.\n\nI met my boyfriend in the second year of high school. He and I share a lot of common interests, so we hit it off pretty quickly. Unsurprisingly, we started dating a short while after. It wasn't always smooth sailing, but he became one of my closest confidants and best friends.\n\nFast forward to this year, we both left town for different colleges. So long distance. Towards the beginning of the year, we kept in contact with skype and messaging. Admittedly, I began to find myself swept away by the change of scenery around this time. With heading to college, I found a new job, new friends and I was pretty busy trying to juggle everything. The red flags first popped up when I found myself becoming less concerned with responding to his messages. Eventually, even talking to him felt like a chore. In all honesty, I could feel my attraction to him waning, and I was sure at the time that I needed to end things.\n\nTo complicate things, I also noticed myself developing a fairly significant crush on another friend of mine. This probably compounded the issue.\n\nMy boyfriend noticed my distance, and he confronted me about it. I told him the truth about how I felt, but what I didn't expect was a sudden onset of feelings of guilt and loss. I started crying midway through. He's my first boyfriend and the 3 years certainly weren't meaningless to me. Much to my chagrin later, I chickened out of ending things and asked for a 'break' in the relationship.\n\nNow, I'm really uncertain about where I stand. I feel absolutely awful about putting this much stress on my boyfriend. I'm really not as attracted to him as I was before, but I worry that this is just a temporary phase (maybe from moving past the honeymoon stage). Or if I'm just going through a \"grass is greener\" moment with my friend. As my feelings are right now, I definitely don't want to continue with the relationship, but I'm worried this might change. As in, am I just losing sight of a good relationship because of distraction?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Guy chasing payment, advice (it's not as heinous as it sounds...probably)\nPOST: A while back, an ex-friend (it'll get obvious why later on) and I were driving, and were involved in an accident. Fortunately, there were no injuries of any sorts, just car issues. Long story short (and also because I have no idea what I was thinking), I reported myself as the driver instead of this ex-friend. This may be important...both of us are international students in the US, I'm still going through college while the other party has returned to their country.\n\nNow, said ex-friend has returned to their country (different from mine) for a few months. Recently, ex-friend contacted me, saying that their previous car insurance company denied a claim, and requires them to pay a certain amount of money. (I'm not sure about the details, but there was something about deductibles) This ex-friend is pretty much forcing me to cough up the full amount because I'm registered as the driver of the accident, which sounds pretty insane to me. I say no, and he assured me that in no uncertain terms that if this issue is brought up in court, I will definitely lose. There were no witnesses at the scene of the accident when it occured, and it doesn't help that I'm not a law student, but this ex-friend is.\n\nThe way I see it, there's no legitimate way out of this for me. However, is there any way that I can \"ghost\" this ex-friend? They only have my cell phone number (which can be easily changed) and my Facebook account (definitely not a problem, lol), and I was considering the possibility of transferring schools so that it's impossible for them to track me. Any other suggestions may also be helpful.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: I have two questions dealing with issues I've been struggling with the past two years.\nPOST: 21/F/CW: 135lbs/61.2kg/5'4''\n\nI've been steadily dropping weight for about the last year just by choosing vegetables and the stairs (SW: 150lbs/68kg). In recent months it has progressed to watching calorie and nutrient intake, and focusing on muscle groups (I'm training to be an aerialist) but there are two things that are holding me back.\n\n1. What is the most calorie effective \"bang for your buck\" alcoholic drink to drink? I realize all of the implications that question begs, but here's the long and short of it. My work and personal friends often converge on bars/pubs to bond and unwind after gigs. I've managed to stave away from the pub food permanently but can't seem to find a low-guilt option for a drink. I'm a red wine drinker, but understand that the carbs and sugar from that is not the best for dropping weight. In general I've cut my alcohol intake drastically already but I can't help but know how bad drinking my calories is.\n\n2. I have and always have had (really, really really) large breasts my whole life and no amount of weight loss or training has ever changed them. At my lowest weight last summer (~125, with D / DD), I looked like an awkward barbie doll. I dropped /maaaaybe/ a cup size when I was working out, but still looked dangerously top-heavy. Body weight exercises and dramatically healthier diet kept them nearly a cup size lower than what I normally am, but any amount of heavy work outs or food consumption outside of the strictest guidelines and they were back to normal. Any suggestions?\n\nThe second is the most vain of my goals. I am already so happy with my overall health increase and being able to wear shirts that show my tummy, but knowing my recreation after hours won't catch up with my fitness would be nice, and looking dainty and perhaps even demure instead of sexy and risqu\u00e9 in just tshirts would send me over the moon.\n\nSorry this got so long. >.>\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I play league of legends together regularly and we both really love the game. He, however, is much better at this game, as well as practically any other game, than I. I've never really enjoyed playing any video/computer game. Until I was introduced to league, that is. I'm not very good and he knows this. When I first started playing I was awful. I played a lot and became better with his help but even at level 30, I play \"as if I am level 10\" (according to him). We really like playing with each other and not alone, but it seems like half the time we do play, we fight. I mess up, buy the wrong items, walk the wrong way, feed, don't use skills correctly, ect....   and he gets a little frustrated, which makes me really angry. I want to do well and to make him proud. But when I get angry in response to his being annoyed over how bad I am at the game, it starts a huge fight. I just feel hopeless whenever I dissapoint him in a game and I blow up in response. I tell him that I need him to remember that it's just a game all the time, and he does know that. But if we lose the game (which is a team game, and my badness really affects the whole team), he acts as if he's wasted an hour and I feel absolutely horrible. Other than this, we rarely have any large fights. What can I do to stop the fighting?\nTL;DR:"}

There was a flirtation between us, but nothing ever came of it. The guy was just flat out playing head games with me for some reason, maybe cause he hadn't had a gf before and didn't know what to do. He would always want to hang out and never actually make/go through with the arrangements. \n\nSo, after a long time of this, I got so tired of the head games, I decided not to waste my time any more and to live my life. I started dating this guy [22 M], \"T\", who I am still with. We have been together for a year now. At first, G voiced his negative opinions about my dating T, sometimes even when sloppy drunk. But I simply ignored this because there was nothing I could do after I gave up with G and found my bf.\n\nAs time passed, G accepted my relationship with T and we stayed in contact. However, lately, my relationship with T has been rocky, and I have been talking to G a lot (almost constantly). I can't stop myself from feeling all of those old feelings toward G, yet, he seems so much different when it comes to my relationship with T. He seems very in favor of it, actually. Could he actually have gotten over it and have no interest in me at all anymore, or could he just be covering it up from where the whole previous thing with my dating and his disapproval happened?\nTL;DR:"}

I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter from a previous relationship whom we both love dearly; however this isn't the point of my post. My problem right now is that J and I decided to pack our belongings and move to a new state in June. It's been hard on us financially. He found a job as a security guard pretty quickly but I have had absolutely no luck. I've been a stay at home mom since I was 19 so I have NO job experience. It seems like NO ONE wants to hire me because of that. I have been turned down and hung up on after the person said, \"Sorry,  I need someone with more experience.\" \n\nSo not only am I being turned down one after another, J is not being understanding. He is calling me lazy, worthless, a bitch, stupid, a gold digger, a moocher... basically anything you can call someone with no job. It hurts a lot. We're both in dire need of money to pay our rent. His security job only nets him about 1200 a month. Our rent here with all utilities rounds out to $1000\n. \nBackground: J and I lived together in our home state and I was on state assistance, and we managed to split the rent and that is how we paid for it previously. We moved to this new state because he has family here and it just seemed like a better opportunity at life. We were originally staying with his mother but things fell apart with her husband being really violent/anger problems and we were kicked out and forced to stay in a hotel for a week before we could find a place to take us. \n\nHis grandmother paid for the first two months of our rent here because it should have only taken two months for us to both get jobs. I can't get cash assistance here because I was already getting it in my other state but I do have food stamps right now.\nTL;DR:"}

We met through some mutual friends, and have hung out in larger groups a decent amount of times over the time we've known each other; however, it's only been once or twice ever hanging out with each other (both times which were great, but a while ago). Due to busy schedules and the way the wind blows (if that's the best way to describe it) we hadn't really talked in a while. Though, with college starting back up this semester and some other circumstances, we've reconnected and I invited her to go bowling. We went this past Monday and had a great time and got ice cream afterwords, and just sat and chatted for an hour. Now it is Thursday, and after seeing her last night at a social event, we made plans to go mini golfing this upcoming Monday.\n\nNow to the part with which I need advice.\n\nYou see, I really like this girl, I have for a while, just, I guess never really made a move or had a chance to. Now that we're talking and hanging out more I would really like to make a move before we fall comfortably back into the dreaded \"friend zone\". But I want to go about it the right way as to avoid screwing things up if she'd prefer to just stay friends. For example, avoiding professing my hypothetical love for her, instead proposing the idea of going on a date. Nothing serious, just to see if it works. \n\nSo how would you say the best way to go about this is. Also I would assume it would be best to do this when we go mini golfing this Monday. \n\nI was thinking something along the lines of \"Hey, not to overstep any boundaries here, but what do you think about going on an actual date. Nothing to serious, just for fun\"\n\nBut then again my ideas haven't gotten me far usually, so I'll leave it up to you.\nTL;DR:"}

I'll be honest, I'm really not a fan of kids, and this one whines a lot.  I can't help but overhear this from my room, and it annoys me.  When they're all here I'm way less likely to come out of my room because it's crowded in the living room and I don't really want to encounter them.

For 4th of July weekend, we both went on a trip to the same location (Socal), and this time texts were probably 6 hours apart from each other.

The past one month has been long distance. Yesterday, I was chatting with him online, text only and he fell asleep during the conversation due to time difference and lack of sleep on his end. It's happened before, and I don't mind. He stays up at odd hours so we can talk while I'm away. \n\nAfter he fell asleep/signed off, I wrote on his Facebook wall saying \"This bitch right here thinks I'm so boring that he fell asleep. <3\" Exactly as is. I got an email about 8 hours later saying I had emasculated him in front of all his friends, how he doesn't call me derogatory terms in front of my friends so he would appreciate that I did the same, and what part of me thought this was a good idea. The email ended with \"at least I know that next time you berate me it'll just be a fucking joke.\"\nThe whole email was also colored with swearing, so it read quite angrily.\n\nI am really confused on how to respond. I will be waiting for him to get online so I can actually have a conversation instead of an email. I did NOT mean my comment in a derogatory or emasculating way. I was trying to be teasing/cute but I apparently failed miserably. I personally feel that he is taking this too seriously, but I understand how messages in text can easily be misconstrued. Regardless of how extreme his response seems to me, I feel horrible for making him feel emasculated and want to make sure he knows that I didn't have any negative intentions with my comment. How do I apologize while still addressing my issue with him taking this so seriously?\nTL;DR:"}

The last year we were living back in our hometown, saving up to go back to school. We were living with his family in a pretty small house. Most of our friends were out of town, so we didn't get out a whole lot. Both of us were pretty frustrated and depressed with our living arrangements, jobs, social life, etc.\n\nHe wound up sort of taking it out on me, associating me with home and not wanting to be around me. He didn't appreciate me and was short tempered. I was getting clingy, focused so much attention on him and wasn't paying any attention to my own dreams/aspirations or anything. We broke up basically because neither of us were happy with our lives and he thought breaking up with me would change things. We didn't really talk or interact until about a year and a half later.\n\nIt's been just over two years now, and our lives have changed drastically. I'm starting a career I love, have plans for my future, have some great friends and generally love my life and am happy with who I am. \n\nHe dated a woman that basically terrorized his life, but other than that has done well. He seems pretty happy with his life as well, except for relationships. We've been talking a lot lately and he keeps saying how much he regrets the things that have happened, how I was the best girlfriend he ever had, how he didn't realize how good he had it until I was gone. He's away for the summer, but we agreed to go out for dinner when he gets back.\n\nReddit, do you believe that people can change after a few years? If I were to give him a chance, could things be different? Does anyone have any experience getting back together with an ex?\nTL;DR:"}

I find the idea that humanity has unlocked the power of the stars awe-inspiring and fascinating... and that we are willing to use it to destroy each other, equally so. Somewhat morbid, perhaps. But a man has his obsessions. Anyways.\n\nI think I've read enough about the Cold War period to get the gist of things. Many accounts I have come across must be rather exaggerated though, since it's usually the exaggerations that stand out and get propagated in the media. So to those who got to experience the real thing -- **what was it like?** Did the possibility of a final world war affect you in any way as you grew up and lived in the era? Was it like going through the 2012 Mayan calendar bullshit, except it was perpetual and *actually possible*? Or did you just take things in stride?\n\nI get the feeling that I have a somewhat \"romanticized\" view of things. Stuff like 99 Luftballons and Trinity (the interactive fiction one) tell me that the threat of a nuclear war was tangible enough to motivate people to produce such media...

We had some ups and downs, but nothing too bad. Long story short, I fell for this girl and she knew it. The last week we were \"together\" she became super distant and we had very little communication. This filled my head with doubts and worries, and after reaching out to her about it, she told me that she needed a break. I don't do breaks, so she ended it completely instead... and promptly started hanging out with another co-worker / acquaintance of ours. Which hurts. Bad. \n\nSo anyway, after about two weeks of trying no contact, things were just incredibly awkward at work. Also, a bunch of my co-workers and I car pool together to go snowboarding and I haven't gone because she goes every time. With her new friend I might add. \n\nSo I decided to reach out to her and talk about trying to get on better terms. The conversation went well, and I could tell that she was very much over me, and I made sure to keep myself in check during the talk so things didn't escalate into an argument or anything. \n\nSo now that just leaves me, in this horrible heart broken position. I'm trying to keep myself busy with other things (gym, snowboarding) and hanging out with friends outside of work as much as possible.

Who, for example, would assume the existence of a SquidsGoneWild subreddit (even if they're a fan of that genre of NSFW). Or if they thought it existed, how would they know that was its name? Moreover, for NSFW in particular, not nearly all fans of a particular subreddit are willing to become members of it.\n\nThen there's the problem of default reddits and the self-amplifying effect: that a subreddit grows in size largely based on its existing popularity within reddit itself (and not as a simple function of its popularity in the 'outside' world).\n\nLastly, there's the problem of picking a number to multiply a given subreddit size. If I'm looking for the number of, say, CircleJerkers in the states, I could multiply the number of r/circlejerk members by (picking a number out of a hat) 15, the ratio of non-redditors to redditors I expect to be roughly that of the US population. \n\nBut for Europe?

I don't normally let my brother sit on my lap, but since at least 12 guys were packing onto a couch made for like 4 people, I let him so sit on my lap, at first I smelled something funny, but I just thought it was because I just didn't deodorize enough, so I just let it go. Well, after the picture, he gets off to go play with one of pur cousins, meanwhile I stay on the couch talking, and then I smell the smell again, and, also, my lap feels wet, and for some obscure reason, I think it's just because he was sweaty... That was a stupid thing to think. So I go down to smell my leg, and I smell the amalgamation of both piss and crap in one big wiff, and I'm not happy, so I go to my brother, who still has his underwear on his head, and I pull him over to my parents and then they bring him to the bathroom. While I go to find my backpack as fast as I can to get my spare jeans. I changed as fast as I could.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/needadvice\nTITLE: Major work issues-not sure if I should be a whistle blower to the head of our company\nPOST: I have been at my company for over two years, and have received promotions and accolades for a job well done. However, the company has grown quickly and some people who have moved into positions of power have let it go to their heads. There are now power struggles across the company and a division between the departments. There are severe breaches in protocol, especially in the HR department. It has gotten to the point where employees do not feel they can discuss their issues with confidentiality. Managers are going back on their word in regards to benefits. Overall, the company is being torn asunder from the inside. I have written an anonymous letter to the head of the company, explaining in detail the concerns and examples of the offenses that have taken place. If I can say anything to the owner to fix these issues and better the company, I feel like it would be worth it. This is new territory for me, and my SO suggested I bring the question of whether this is a good idea or not to the good people of Reddit. What would you suggest I do-send the letter, knowing full well that, if it were discovered that I wrote the letter, I could be retaliated against (even though there is a policy against any retaliation towards employees who complained), get other people in trouble for discussing their issues, and open the possibility for disciplinary actions, including termination. I do not want to put anyone else in the line of fire that was brought on by myself, but no one else will stand up to these people, and I have sat idly by for too long. Has anyone been in a similar situation, or wanted to do something but decided against it? Thanks in advance for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

Shortly after, I had sex with my first love because I was feeling so down and out and NEEDED someone to be there for me (bad idea all around). My first love started becoming interested in me and such. This is about the time I realize I should have been a lot more patient with the guy I want to be with. We start talking again and I tell him about me having sex with this guy. He freaks out and says it'll be a long time before he wants anything to do with me.

He flirted with me - long held eye contact, lots of smiles in my direction, compliments. Over the course of a week or so we ran into each other several times. He hinted at wanting to get together with me outside our group. I initiated the agreed-upon event and got a \"quite possibly\" response to each of the free dates I suggested. Not knowing what \"quite possibly\" meant I tossed back a \"10-4. Let me know\" response. Haven't heard from him since (it's been a week). I think this is a \"letting me down gently\" sort of move. We have a lot of friends in common, and every one says \"he's the nicest guy\" so I don't think he would have led me on purposely. I know he's a year or so off of a divorce...I'll be seeing him in our group tomorrow. I can't to be friendly but NOT flirty. \n\nAre there any alternative theories about why a seemingly nice guy would lay it on thick with flirting to only be super aloof and cold?

Our relationship is great other than this issue. We have fun together, rarely argue, have built a life together and have a bright future ahead. We were each other's first for everything. A problem in our relationship had been that he feels he is missing out by not getting to have sex with other women. He has been having doubts about getting married because of this. I have been trying to be understanding and open about it. We had a threesome a while back and we both loved it. It's something that I'd love to do in the future. After the threesome he told me that the urge to go out and explore was gone, but then he said that it's crept back up on him lately. \n\nI just don't think I could let him go through with it without being hurt. It's got to do with a lot of my own insecurities. I've lost a lot of weight and I'm still losing weight, so that's a big issue. He has also said that he doesn't really find me 'sexy' even though he loves me, enjoys sex, couldn't imagine marrying anyone else, etc. He basically says that he's pretty sure I'm the one that he wants to spend his life with and I don't have to worry about him leaving me for anyone else, but he doesn't think that he would be happy if he couldn't have se with other women. I am trying to believe him, and even though he's never cheated and never given me a reason not to trust him, I'm still scared he'll like someone else better than me. \n\nI don't know how to tell him that I'm not okay with him having sex with anyone else without me. I don't want to make him feel trapped (which he says he does sometimes) and make him ultimately leave me. I don't want to be the crazy, jealous girlfriend. I just want to be enough for him.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I (22/m) got invited by a friend (21/f) that I used to be romantically involved with to a local Christmas market and I don't know if she intends it to be a date.\nPOST: My friend and I have known each other since freshman year of college, and this year when we began the semester both of us were just out of relationships. After spending the day together for the second day in a row I ended the night by kissing her. After this we went on several dates and were spending a ton of time together, and in that time we both found out that we'd had crushes on each other for a while. But it ended when she decided she didn't want to get into another relationship right away. I was fine with this and we continued to be friends hanging out at least once a week.\n\nNow the semester has ended and it's been a couple of weeks since I've seen her so the other day I texted to see what was up. We chatted for a while until she mentioned that she was going to the local Christmas market in the next couple days with her little sister. After I said the Christmas market was cool because I'd seen it last year she said I could come too. I responded by joking about how fun going to the Christmas market with her and her sister sounded and said maybe. She immediately responded to clarify that \"yes that was an invite\" and that if I didn't want to go around with her sister we could go do something else christmas-y together, so I said I'd go.\n\nI didn't think much about it at the time, but now that the day that we are going is coming up I can't help but wonder if she intends this to be a date. I would try to gauge the situation myself but I'm terrible at that. I would ask her directly, but I'm worried about coming off as someone that's spent the last semester pining over her because of our history. Basically I don't want to approach it as a date and then scare her off if I'm wrong, but I also don't want to assume it's not a date and ruin things by seeming disinterested.\n\nIs there any really obvious way to tell if she thinks it's a date? Is it too weird and forward to ask her if it's supposed to be a date?\nTL;DR:"}

Despite the problems we're working on, they're secondary, and don't invalidate our relationship.\n\nHOWEVER I think I may have accidentally asked another girl out.

I want this second girl to be in my life as a friend. She's both cool and intelligent, and different enough to my usual friends that it's refreshing.

I could use some advice for finding out whether she's interested as a friend or just 'interested'. Since I want to befriend her, I don't want to be a boring tool and play hard to get, or play any silly mind games. At the same time, I feel like directly asking her if she thought this was a date could go wrong. For one thing, it'd be a slap in the face if she did, and for another, I'd look like an egotistical prat if she didn't.\n\nMy current plan is to meet her, hang out as normal and be my normal self, maybe casually drop references to my girlfriend, and then later invite her out with a bunch of my other friends, so it's a less intimate atmosphere.\nTL;DR:"}

If she wanted to open/close/run the floor, she would be.\n\nWhen she comes in, I usually ask her to take a register to allow the other register person (who has also been there since 5) to take their break. She will often refuse, or act like she has taken a register and then five minutes later I will look up and she is performing another task. Every time I try to get her to take the register, (which is very important for us to meet speed of service and sales goals) she never does because she does not like the register.

I don't want to jump into bed with someone whom I don't respect anymore and I'm no longer friends with.\n\nI have conflicting wants/needs right now. On the one hand, I need to get laid. Is a known devil really better than an unknown angel? Should I sleep with him just so I can relieve myself of my sexual frustration?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My (30M) GF (26F) just broke up, I think she might blackmail me.\nPOST: I'd like a little advice please. The other day, after a really fun date night in which I proposed to her (and she said yes), my then-girlfriend of 11 months woke me up by kicking me in the back, punching me, and being very verbally and physically abusive because I was snoring, apparently.\n\nShe stormed off to her friend and next-door neighbor. When she came back she shouted at me that I'M abusive, that I choked her, called her names, etc. I did no such thing, yet from what I can tell this is the story she's been telling all of her friends. She's also had a pattern of dreaming mean things I would do, then believing they actually happened, but never anything this bad.\n\nSo, after we broke up I'm finding myself with about $1000 of her possessions at my place. Bike, laptop, books and whatnot. She called me once and said she would not pick them up nor should I attempt to see her, then 'ghosted' me and I'm very afraid she might lie and that these possessions might be a future liability somehow. Should I sell them? Leave them on her doorstep? She lives in a high traffic area so they'd probably just get stolen.\n\nShe's established a long history of lying and being manipulative, I just don't want her to come back and accuse me of further abuse, stealing or anything like that.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel sorry for her. When I was at my wits-end about him I had contacted one of his exes through FB and she helped me so much (reassuring me that I wasn't crazy and that his bad behavior was not only life-long, but had gotten much worse). \n\nWe're talking scary drugs, arrest warrants, no money, sociopathic tendencies, asexuality, the works, which he can hide for awhile, but not for long.

I think I already know the answer to this based on me already feeling a bit creepy having found her on facebook but here goes. \n\nMale, 25. On Sunday I was out mountain biking. About a 1/4 of the way around the trail I caught up to a girl who was having a rest and as I do when I see other's stopped for a chat. She ended up actually riding the rest of the trail with me. When I stopped to grab something to eat, she would stop too and wait so I guess she was happy to hang with me or she could've carried on her way. She ended up falling off and breaking her bike so I went a little slower than normal so she didn't have to walk back to her car on her own. I kinda just awkwardly departed asking her name and saying nice to meet you and have a good trip home etc.\n\nI should've asked for her number but didn't although did get a name so had a quick look on facebook when I got home but couldn't find her. Then today in my 'People You May Know' section she randomly appears. Question is do I message her? \n\nI don't particularly want to date her (whilst I would in an instant in normal circumstances she lives 2 hours away which I feel is too far but she travels to the same trails I do so this is more as friends). I just think she was real cool and would love to ride with her whenever she's in town - from what I gathered she doesn't have many friends that are in to mountain biking so it would be fun to show her around some of the natural trails. Women of Reddit, would you be weirded out if you were messaged something along the lines of \"hi if you want to ride some time hit me up etc\"\nTL;DR:"}

I found myself becoming jealous of my friends who get to go out to the pub/bar and hit on girls and take them home, or flirt with girls at parties. \n\nThere have been times where a girl has shown interest in me, and it's only due to the fact that i forgot to mention my girlfriend to them.

My girlfriend has had previous boyfriends and is pretty sure she wants to stay with me, marry me, have kids in the future. I'm not going to lie but that does sound nice, but i feel like i am missing out on my teenage years of enjoying life by tying myself down to one girl at such a young age.\n\nHalf of me wants to stay with her because she makes me happy, then 5 minutes later we are arguing over some pointless shit and i hate being around her.

We see each other maybe 1 time a year, so I took advantage of it. I pulled her aside to \"shop\", and told her I wanted to open a dialogue about sex. She was a little uncomfortable, but understood.

So I'm not sure how to proceed, I took a page from the christian community and am considering just asking her to enter a relationship with me because I really do like her that much.\n\nA couple things to consider is that while we were on our adventure I communicated that I needed a lot of space in relationships trying to silently acknowledge that I was ok taking things kind of slow and I would be comfortable with her being a flight attendant (being gone a lot of the time ect.)\n\n Lastly she brought up a guy who had confessed his feelings to her earlier on in the summer and how she did have a crush on him but was ultimately uninterested. Once again this is a huge friendship only flag to me but on the other hand she may be thinking that if she tells me she's not into anyone that she wants me to go further with her.\n\nShe does a lot of stuff that I feel an interested party would do. Like tonight at dinner for example she held my gaze for ~15 seconds, in front of other people.\n\nHow should I proceed r/elationships?!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How do I consciously convince myself [24f] that my boyfriend [28m] really DOES love me?\nPOST: I've been dating my boyfriend going on about four years now, and he is my first real boyfriend. The relationship is great: we go out all the time, laugh, have mind blowing sex on a regular basis, he treats me great. I lost my virginity to him, he lost his to me and I have never dated anyone else for this long. The more serious we get, the more insecure I get. As a whole, the relationship has made me more of a confident person: he compliments me and makes me feel good about myself, but I have a crippling fear that I will eventually unintentionally push him away. \n\nI have been struggling with depression and self esteem problems for most of my life and although I feel as if I have been keeping it at bay recently, sometimes I am scared that my boyfriend is falling out of love with me, or will somewhere in the near future. I know the problem lies with me, though - he is a perfect boyfriend, and I can't think of anything that he does wrong. Tiny things manifest themselves in my mind as huge, threatening problems. For example: I have no problem with him watching porn, realise that it's normal and all of that, but sometimes I get a little afraid that he watches/follows specific cam4 girls and this spirals out of control and I eventually assume he's cheating on me with girls on the internet. No matter how much I tell myself I'm being completely irrational, I somehow manage to lose sleep over it. I'm also afraid of talking to him about any of this because I'm afraid he'll think I don't trust him or something.\n\nI really don't know what I'm asking here, I just need help with accepting the fact that someone really actually loves me, and not push him away because of silly scenarios I make up in my head. How do I do it without creating a conflict that doesn't need to be there? How do I actually take \"I love you\"'s to heart?\nTL;DR:"}

We have only been dating for two months but he seems to have become way too comfortable with me. First off, I am bisexual and this is no secret from him. Every now and then I'll make a comment about a girl who walked by or a waitress but never anything more than \"she was cute.\" He, however, has been constantly checking other girls out (which is natural of course) but has had the nerve to say things such as \"I want to (nsfw comment) her\" and going into detail. I have since stopped making comments about other women and definitely NOT commenting on other men, yet he continues. I can't tell if this is just a test to see my reaction or if he honestly doesn't realize the lack of etiquette here. I don't care that he looks at other women but I definitely don't want to know the dirty thoughts that come to his mind.\n\nAlso, he has been talking more and more about his ex-girlfriends recently. I make it a point to NEVER talk about an ex unless directly asked. I didn't mind hearing tidbits of his past, however, when he went into detail about a girlfriend cheating on him because he didn't sleep with her for a while or how great his most recent ex's legs were, that kind of pissed me off. \n\nI haven't mentioned any of this to him because I can't tell if I am overreacting or not.

We've met in person a few times and have good chemistry. \n\nHowever, she's got some body image issues, mainly stemming from her being very tall (6ft) having a wider set of shoulders, small breasts and a somewhat masculine looking face. When we first met, we were just friends and I had zero idea what she looked like ( relationship began online ). After she and I became girlfriend and boyfriend, we exchanged pictures and stuff. I'll admit, I didn't find her exactly my type at first, but I had a good feeling and managed to move past it. But today she sent me a naughty pic of herself, I replied back with compliments, and I seemingly did okay, but she got all depressed and said she was unattractive and unfeminine. I tried to console her and told her she was too hard on herself, but it didn't help.\n\nShe now thinks I find her unattractive, which isn't true. I can't seem to convince her otherwise and she's been in this mood for a good 6-12 hours. Very irritating to me, because I almost feel like she no longer trusts me. I'm rather hurt by her not having confidence in my reassurance. \n\nNext part, I'll be honest: If she wasn't as compatible personality wise and intellectually, I'd have probably never go for it. But I didn't fall in love with her looks, but with her personality and intellect. I'm... ugh I don't even know how to describe how I feel, other than like I messed up somewhere. \n\nI love her, how do I fix this before it becomes a problem later? I want to be with her, bailing on her is not an option for me emotionally, because she's the only woman I've been with that didn't use me.\nTL;DR:"}

However now people we both know are telling me that we should get together but she still doesn't know about that.

Not many people know that she's dating and when they found out most are surprised to hear her boyfriend isn't me. \n\nNow when I mentioned things are getting odd she's been acting more friendly than usual recently, asking me to go with her after school to get Slurpees, tagging along with me off campus to get lunch despite the fact she had no money to buy anything, and even sharing her lunch with me at times when I forget to bring some. She didn't do these kind of things a month ago but now she is, it's not a bad change but still it makes me wonder what to do. However she seems to tease me about things from last year, when we were leaving school she said she saw her boyfriend then quickly glanced at me and said she wanted to see how I'd react, she also threw an eraser at me and said \"maybe this'll have sentimental value to you,\" there's other examples as well but these were some of the more prominent ones. \n\nI've been talking to some friends and they're willing to support me but of course I don't even know how to tell her all this.

After interviewing with the company, they extended an offer.  Yay!  The offer is a 3-month contract-to-hire.  \n\nI'm a bit weary of why the contract portion is so much shorter than what was originally discussed.  In the interview, the manager said they have several permanent positions available and asked if I'd be interested in going that route rather than a contract, and I said I would be.  I'm wondering why the contract is so short though - a few friends think it's due to this being the shortest period they can contract through the staffing agency before hiring.  Others are a bit more paranoid, myself included, and tend to think it may be a chance to weed out faster and may suggest they have less faith in my abilities.  \n\nHas anyone worked with staffing agencies on contracts before?  Do contract durations mean anything?  Do I realistically have a chance at transitioning to a permanent role from this, or am I setting myself up for 3 months of work then nothing?\nTL;DR:"}

She dropped out of school and smokes pot during the day and goes out to the underground music scene to do hard drugs and have sex at night. That's all well and good for most teenagers, but she has a kid. Her kid is basically 100 percent my responsibility. (The Dad left almost immediately after Rachel fell pregnant) \n\nNow Rachel's got bored of this lifestyle and is now wanting her Ex boyfriend back to help with the kid etc. So she wants him to move in, and I have a massive issue with this. The main issue being I work for a non-profit, have my own lifestyle to pay for and her ex is a gigantic \"alpha\" asshole. He's on welfare and smokes all day while spending the rest on his car.\n\n**This is 100 percent of the reason I don't want him in my house.**\n\nShe gets hysterical about it. She cries, screams, gets paranoid if I tell her it's not happening. Blames our family's collapse on me. Calls me a racist for not letting him into our house. She kicks in walls and doors.\n\nI figured I only have about a year left of being obliged to care for her but I am really not sure if I'll be able to get through it without stabbing myself in the throat, it's just too much pressure.\n\nI'm sorry if I missed anything important, I'm really in a foul mood and quite stressed. \n\nI have no idea how to get through this, or what I should do?\nTL;DR:"}

We started out as roommates around a year and a half ago. \n\nI know, I know. Never fuck or fall in love with your roommate. I don't need a lecture. It just happened. We've been friends for almost a decade and have \"hooked up\" in the past. \n\nEverything in our relationship is amazing. Except for one thing--he usually refers to me as his roommate, or as nothing. Only his best friend knows that we are together, but all of my friends know. I refer to him as my partner in conversations with my very best friends, or even conversations with people at the grocery store. I understand it's kind of weird to have to tell all of your friends your former roommate is now your girlfriend. But I didn't have a problem with it. \n\nI know \"boyfriend\" is just an arbitrary label for others and it's not really important. I'm not really concerned about the label, just the acknowledgement of being in a romantic, emotional relationship with someone. I think I'm a smart, funny girl with an amazing personality  and I'm ok to look at. But this whole thing is making me doubt everything about myself that I've worked so hard to build up. After being referred to as \"my roommate\" or nothing, I often wonder \"what's wrong with me that I'm not good enough to be anything more??\" I feel like all of his friends see me as the roommate who obviously has a huge crush on him that isn't reciprocated. \n\nI've brought this up before. I don't know what to do anymore. What do I do? I know I shouldn't let it bother me, but I've been in relationships before where I've put in 100% only to get shit back.\n\nIf you see this, I'm sorry. But my friends are tired of hearing about it and I don't have anyone else to talk to.\nTL;DR:"}

A couple years ago we ran into each other when my best friend worked with his girlfriend. Over the past few years he would drunk message me on Facebook/poke me and send flirtatious messages. I mostly didn't respond, but every now and then I would write back to the non-flirty ones. Fast forward to last weekend, I get a message from Rob asking me to complete a survey/study for a class. (I didn't think anything of it, I get requests like this all time from friends in college) He asked me a few questions including: Who is your favorite teacher ? What was your first job? I answer thoughtfully and didn't think anything of it. Later that day, I am going through my emails. I receive an email from Apple saying that my account is locked due to someone answering my security questions incorrectly too many times. I change my password, move on, whatever. Then it clicks in my head... I check my security questions and sure enough..they match 2 of the 5 \"survey\" questions. I send a message immediately to Rob... what the hell? I can see him reading my Facebook message, but not responding. This guy is also in a band that has a large following on youtube, and is \"internet famous\", but what the hell man? I have no idea what he could possible want with my AppleID. Credit Cards,buying his own music, buying apps, photos, I don't know what, but regardless the password would reset to my own email. It's too much of a coincidence that this would happen on the same day. At this point I'm just pissed and want an explanation. I also want to email his girlfriend about this odd incident. What would you do?\nTL;DR:"}

We've had relationship bumpiness, just like every other couple, but in times of bumpiness, it seems like the drama/fight gets amplified by the fact that my boyfriend almost always defers to his brothers advice. In the past, his brother and I have had some tension between us, and his brother has tried multiple times to break us up, calling me a gold digger, bitch, etc. I tried to patch the relationship up a few years ago, and extended an olive branch to my future brother in law. I thought that things were good between all of us, until recently the boyfriend and I were talking about prenups. I have consistently stated that I would be against signing one, and today I said it would be a deal breaker for me. My boyfriend beat around the bush before it came out that his brother had said \"don't tell your girlfriend that it's my idea, but you should get a prenup.\" I am upset and hurt. And my boyfriend says \"I have to go against one of your guys' best advice.\" \n\nMy boyfriend will be receiving two small settlements within the next 5 years.

Most of the time the answers are the same, ultimately you've got to chase what makes you happy, also because to live unhappily would negatively impact those around you. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nThis leads to a second question: at what point is the line drawn, how 'bad' (subjective term) of a person do you let yourself become to get it? Could it be argued that if you choose to stop yourself before you hurt others, you never really wanted it more? Are 'evil' people and criminals just people gutsy enough to really chase what makes them happy? If so is there really anything wrong with that? In terms of evolution, those strong enough to get what they want are the best suited to survive, right? Any thoughts would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Jake texted me, and we were going to hang out with at his dorm after dinner, so I had to  drive and pick him up. Two other people from that dinner, which Jake met for the first time also lived in the general direction, so Jake offered them a ride and I was okay with it. One of them was a guy and other girl named Jane. We all sat in the car and had some conversation, and I thought Jane was pretty cute. I dropped them off one at a time, but didn't get Jane's contact since it was kinda brief and I thought it was too weird to ask, but now it seems like I've missed out on the opportunity to get to know her. Jake added her on facebook after the event,I didn't, and now it would be too weird because too much time, like half a year, has passed.\n\nI told Jake that i'm interested in meeting her and he's willing to help, but he doesn't really talk to her much either, so now we're both stuck on trying to find a less creepy approach to suddenly call her out of the blue.\n\nHere are two approaches I had in mind, even though I had never really experimented with them\n\n1. Jake can tell her that I'm interested in meeting her, even though this is like super straight forward and could potentially be creepy, mind you though i'm generally not bad looking, and certainly dont come across as a creep\n\n2. Jake can set up a dinner or something with all 3 of us together, though the approach again would be out of the blue, but it seems like there's no way to get around it.\n\nmaybe go with 1? and try not to give a crap?

It is only the last year that we have been able to move close to each other.\n\nI feel the relationship has stagnated over the last year and im just no longer as interested in being with her as i was in the earlier years. I still think of her as my best friend and a person i can trust with anything, a person i care for etc. but I feel like it isnt the same anymore. Time spent together isnt as fun or exciting and i cant see a future together, at least not right now.\n\nNow, my problem is we have invested a lot into this relationship. We have made big commitments to each other and promises however I feel by leaving her, im in a way betraying her trust or breaking a promise. I cannot shake this overwhelming sense of guilt if we do end it.\n\nShe has \"broken\" up with me in the past, however this usually results in her calling me back within an hour and pleading for forgiveness in tears. I want to keep her as a friend but realize that may be impossible, more importantly im concerned about her own health and dont want her to spiral into some kind of depression post-breakup, she has had depressive episodes before and shes prone to things like this.\n\nTo be with someone for so long and end it simply because im not feeling it anymore seems strange. There has been no big fight recently or major issue. Its just a slow degrading of my feelings towards her romantically. I have tried reinvigorating the relationship but feel its hopeless, my feelings are not longer there and every day i feel more sad that it has come to this. I feel she senses it and she has suggested numerous plans to create some excitement, holiday destinations etc. but i simply cant find the enthusiasm to go through with this. \n\nHow can i tell her this?\nTL;DR:"}

About 2 weeks ago, I went on vacation and thought about him a lot while I was there and decided I should probably explain myself and why I liked him but had terrible trust issues.\n\nWhen I got back he invited me to go get food after school, which was a normal thing for us. He forgot about it and I called him a bunch of times but he was no where to be found, he eventually called me and apologized.\n\nI didn't get to see him before we went on winter break then I had family stuff to do until post christmas.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, how should I help my girlfriend in expanding her circle of friends?\nPOST: Bit of background for you. My girlfriend of just over a year and a half has been feeling depressed recently over her lack of a social life. She didn't make a lot of acquaintances when she was away at college (before I knew her) but had a close knit circle of friends with whom she is no longer in contact (I don't know why). She sees a few close friends from high school periodically but they're either very flaky (making plans, then cancelling time and again) or wrapped up in their relationships.\n\nI have a few hobbies which afford me good friends outside of work (I play in two musical groups and also play soccer) but, aside from me, my girlfriend really doesn't have anyone to talk or meet up with on a regular basis. When I have plans I try to include her as much as possible but she's pretty shy and feels left out because of the common connections that my groups of friends share (music etc.). \n\nIn the past month she has been feeling sad about not being able to rely on anyone other than me (her words) but is very shy and lacks self-confidence when meeting new people. How should I best tactfully suggest ways she can expand her social circle and meet people with whom she shares common interests without a) seeming arrogant in trying to 'fix' her and b) damaging her self-confidence any more?\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for about 4 years, married only for a few months. \n\nI'm having a hard time getting past my husband's online behaviour. To put it shortly, he is very flirtatious (?) On Facebook and instagram and snapchat. He's been caught chatting with a girl on facebook about the usual stuff before, about how he liked her and wanted to see her and all that jazz, but nothing ever got physical and I shut it down immediately before anything else had progressed. I made him block that specific person on all accounts and even send a message to her saying that both he and she were being very disrespectful towards me, and how she knew we were together but had continued to pursue him which had made me very upset.\n\nBut that was over, and we have been communicating better and both working through our issues. Now, he was always the very flirtatious type, but nothing ever really suspicious or over the edge. But lately, he's been commenting on photos of his \"friends\" bare butts  and others pictures with cleavage and profile pictures with smiley faces and \"very nice :)\", \"you're looking 100%\", etc etc...but what really has been ticking me off has been those photos that everyone has been sharing that goes something like \"like 3 pics and I'll rate you\" or \"comment your name and I'll give you a emoji\" which is always about would I date you, screw you or whatever.\nAnd he's been doing a lot of those. Commenting on girls pics and then sending back comments like that. \n\nMy question here is, am I just being a psycho based on past infidelity? Am I being reasonable in getting mad? \nWhat should I say to him?\nTL;DR:"}

Been speaking for about 5 months now. Call it cheesy, but I've never quite known anyone like her. We're more than likely going to step it up at some point, and we talk dirty to each other fairly often - I really turn her on by telling her what I'd do to her based on what seems natural to me - but we don't get to see each other much. To make matters worse, she recently said \"you're going to be incredible, I just know it\". No pressure then.

I'm now in quite an awkward situation as I've told her what (I think) I'd like most (positions etc.) and that I've \"been with\" a few girls before; I guess I have, just not gone all the way. She seems to expect me to be some experienced, excellent lover, and I'm really worried about disappointing her both in terms of not being 100% honest, and if/when we get around to getting it on. I'm guessing my chances of performing fantastically on my first time are not great.\n\nHow would you go about dealing with this situation? Or, as the girl, how would you feel if you'd known someone a few months, had expectations of them that turned out a little off?

It went really well and it felt like nothing had changed. Not necessarily like we were in a relationship, but it felt really natural, friendly, and as if we remained friends all this time.\n\nA few weeks pass and I decide to message him again-- this time there was the same friendliness and good conversation as before. However, this time he asked if I wanted to grab coffee sometime this week to catch up some more. I said yes and now we have plans.\n\nWould I be thinking too much into it if I thought he was interested again? I know the general relationship rule of, \"grab a coffee actually means get back together,\" but I also don't want to get ahead of myself.

So.. after much discussion, we decided to move in together.  We both know that it's a bad idea only because we haven't known each other for very long.  It's just something that would help both of us out in our crappy situation right now.  The good news is that we get along just fine.  We make each other very happy and we have tons in common.

We've attended the same school for two years (a high school college dual enrollment program), and I've had a crush on her from the moment we first met (not even joking - she walked over on orientation day and said hello to my best friend, and I fell pretty hard). I even asked her out about a week after we met (in a ridiculously over-the-top and embarrassing manner which I don't want to post even anonymously), and she replied by saying that she didn't want a relationship. Since then, we've been friends, but there's been some obvious tension as I still have a crazy crush on her (which she may or may not even realize). I asked her to prom months ago, and she initially accepted, until about a week later when she realized that maybe I didn't want to just go as friends. In these two months, I've tried to remain civil and just be friends, but it's hard. \n\nPersonally, I think we'd be really perfect for each other, and have a ridiculous amount of stuff in common intellectually and emotionally. We get along great as friends, there is never a lull in the conversation, and we have similar senses of humor. She just doesn't want a relationship with ANYONE right now, allegedly because it would get in the way of school. This is even more ironic because until I met her, I had no interest in a relationship of any kind and viewed high-school relationships as pointless and shallow.\n\nAnyway, now it's college season for us high-school seniors, and we've applied to some of the same colleges. We actually had the same top choice and were both accepted, but today I found out that she turned down her acceptance offer. So, what I'm here to ask:\n\n1. Should I still try to pursue a possible future relationship considering everything (if more details are needed just comment and I can add, I just figured this post was getting pretty long)? Should I try and make a move now or wait?\n\n2. Do you think she declined the college offer BECAUSE it was my first choice?

In fact, I now see her more regularly than him. \n\nUnfortunately, she cheated on him and they have now broken up. He and I were talking about it tonight, taking a walk, and the conversation turned in an unexpected direction. See, this is the first time in the decade of friendship that we have both been single at once. He broached the idea of \"friends with benefits\" and I agreed that I would be okay with that, but not right away since his ex is a good friend. We both admitted to finding the other decidedly attractive, but never bringing it up before out of respect for each others' relationships.\n\nAs the night wore on and we were talking more, things got a bit more physical than expected. I let him kiss me, something he'd never done before. We made out for a while, fooled around a little bit. We didn't have sex, but it was close to that. \n\nNow I'm in a bit of a pickle. While this was a \"long time coming\" for the two of us, his ex is such a close friend but I know she would completely fall apart if she knew we even kissed, nevermind anything more!

I told him nothing more would happen for a while, which he agreed was for the best. Also agreed we wouldn't mention it to her for now, since she would not handle that very well. I'm not good at keeping secrets and I'm worried that she might hear it from someone else, which would probably be worse than if I owned up to it.\nTL;DR:"}

We're both in country for another 6 months or so, but after that neither of us really know where we'll be going. I have trouble living in the moment, so I keep thinking about that deadline and it makes me a tad wary about getting serious with someone, I'm curious if other people think that's something I shouldn't think about. \n\nI'm also super inexperienced when it comes to dating in general. I was at a pub with this girl and we were flirting and having a good time, but I ended up leaving early as planned due to being a tad sick. If I'm being honest with myself, I also probably bailed because I don't really know how to go about taking a girl home and I felt like that expectation was there a bit. She was disappointed that I left early (as am I in retrospect,) but we made tentative plans to hang out. Other buddies at the pub were quick to point out that I blew it, but I'm not really looking for a random hook-up. \n\nI'm also a virgin, which I feel a little self-conscious about due to my age. While I've had a couple of girlfriends, my only lengthy relationship was with a girl who didn't want to have sex before marriage, and I never got the hang of taking somebody home as I mentioned before. \n\nI really like this girl.\nTL;DR:"}

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nSo here it goes:  \n\nI found my boyfriend's reddit account (gasp shock awe if he found out) while looking up some advice on a different topic. By complete chance I came across his profile because this person's post seemed like something he would ask around that timeframe. I know he loves reddit so I just peeked on the profile and BAM there he was.  \n  \n\nWe've been dating for roughly a year now and this is where I seek your advice: I noticed that he posted stuff (roughly a year ago) regarding our initial flirtations and his views on relationships. He did imply in one post that I was dumb, he also stated in another that he would like a long term relationship eventually but, being an alpha, asked if he should continue with the spinning plates theory (continue to have a lot of options), essentially asking if cheating is condoned....  \n  \n\nHe hasn't posted much since those posts just shy of a year ago, but the things he did say were relatively hurtful and I am questioning how he views me now....he says he would never cheat, but these posts completely throw me off.  \n  \n\nSo sorry for the rant; the questions are:  \n\n* Should I bring this up to him even though these were posted during the earlier stages of our relationship?  \n\n* Should I let it go since it was pretty much a year ago now?  \n\n* Would any of you bring this up to your SO? How would you go about it?  \n  \n\nI feel like I shouldn't feel shitty about things said about me a year ago and I feel like I should probably just let it go...but I would love anyone's advice on what they would do in this situation!

We like to have company and often have friends over at our house just to chill. Lately, he's been inviting his co-worker and his girlfriend over to hang out. Her and I got along really well from the beginning, we have a ton in common and we are interested in the same things. We also grew up in similar circumstances and have the same views on things. Neither of us have a lot of other female friends so it was cool to have another girl to hang out with instead of it always being a sausage fest at my house.\n\nWe have all been hanging out at least a few times a week for around a month. I even message her on facebook sometimes too. I have been nothing but nice to her and vice versa, I really enjoy hanging out and talking with her. Basically I was under the impression that we were on the path to becoming good friends. I feel (felt?) like I could trust her if I needed to get something off my chest, and she has even opened up to me about a few things in her life which made me feel like we were becoming really close. What was even better was that my boyfriend and I had another couple to hang out with together, and that's what we all did. \n\nThe last couple days they haven't wanted to hang out, understandably. I really didn't see it as a big deal at all. However, yesterday, I got a text from my boyfriend while he was at work. His coworker told him that they haven't been coming over because his girlfriend gets uncomfortable when I talk to him. Which is really confusing to me because (1) I CLEARLY am in a relationship, (2) we are all supposed to be hanging out together, so of course I talk to him, and (3) I only ever talk to him when we are all together, its not like I text him or have him on social media at all. It hurt my feelings that she would think there was anything going on. I have done nothing but try to be friends with HER. So my questions are: (1) should I confront her about it? (2) should I even try to continue friendship with her?\nTL;DR:"}

There's only one blemish on my resume, and I'm not proud of it. \n\nAround a year and a half ago, I took on a position organizing a fundraiser for a small local group. Right from the get-go, this role was a disaster. The group was undergoing some major restructuring, and I did not have the support I needed to do thorough job. Additionally, the work-load, which was initially supposed to be around 10 hours a week, ended up being far more. The role wasn't a good fit, and it showed in my attitude (I was stressed out all. the. time). Anyway, long story short, I took the group through the critical period of organizing and supporting the fundraiser, but left around two months later. My leaving was difficult, and they made it very clear that they had expected me to stay. \n\nHere's the thing - I really want to clear things up with this group. Both for personal reasons (I know I didn't do a great job, and I want to let them know that I could have done better) and political (this is a small city, and I worry that word would get around).

Once I was 15, and saw people living their lives and discussing memories from when they were kids, only then did I realize how uneventful my life was up until then. That and the fact that I actually couldn't recall the majority of my childhood, because it had no notable events. I don't really blame my anyone. My parents kept me in the house only because they wanted to protect me, and they worked all day (still do). As a result of this, I never developed much social skills. Although, on the contrary, I was given a good characteristic out of all this. I loved learning. Because I wasn't concerned with friends or women, I was able to learn and study a LOT. I learned a lot about science, history, industry, music, economy, the trades, human anatomy, etc. These skills are very useful and to a certain degree make school an exciting thing for me. So now, at 16 years old, I've started caring about my appearance, the opposite sex, and started making many friends. It's a very enlightening experience.

Whenever I ask for a picture, she hesitates and always complains that she does not like taking pictures. Now what's the big deal now? Why take picture for some stranger? The pictures were also quite revelaing to her cleavage and the guy complimented on that too. All she replied was with agreeing with him and was flattered. \n\nNow, the guy basically asks her if she would date him. And she said totally, without a thought about me. I was texting her at the same time she said this too, and they are now in a long distance relationship behind my back. I dont know how to confront her over this and it really breaks my heart to find this out. I never expected her to cheat on me, what should I do? Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

(xpost from /r/advice)\nPOST: I don't want to make a big long post about this so I'll keep it as short as possible. I'm 22. I have $7,500 in savings. I work a part-time minimum wage job, which is of no importance to me. I have an AA degree and am two semesters away from graduating with a bachelors in business. I live at home but it's very rough living here. My mom is abusive and my dad blames me for it. I don't have a car, license, or know how to ride a bike. I called around in my area for driving lessons and they all told me I'm too far away for them to come in a car and teach me. So transportation is limited.\n\nI don't require much to be happy. All I need is a good laptop, a Kindle, decent income, and a clean studio apartment. My ideal day would be to wake up, exercise, read, write, go to work, sleep, repeat. My family isn't very supportive when it comes to my mom's abuse and they all blame me, so I can't get help there. I used to live with an abusive ex that was very violent and I'm tired of being around abusive people. I would like to leave the state/country and start over completely. I don't want contact with my family. I have lived a very sheltered life and want to change that, so a new state or country is ideal. I will be lucky if I live fifty more years and I want to enjoy life instead of being around miserable people.\nTL;DR:"}

We've tried explaining why we're doing that thing now, schedules where he has some choice, letting everyone pick one activity, giving him a smaller choice that doesn't screw with the larger schedule... I've also tried helping him cultivate a more positive attitude by getting everyone to list off fun things that they got to choose that day. Or helpful traits, like complementing him for changing activities well.\n\nWe also sometimes do counting and some limited discipline if things go too far (short time outs with talking, loss of video games, going home)\nTL;DR:"}

Even her very lacy, strapless, hot pink bra was in the laundry pile. The panties to be washed were all thongs. \n\nAnd, of course, this is all underwear that I haven't personally seen her wearing in months. When we go to bed she's usually in her regular cotton panties, which is fine obviously, she should be comfortable, but then it's like she's a different person when I'm not around. \n\nIt's bewildering, and frankly kind of disturbing to me that she wears this stuff when I'm not around but doesn't wear it when I am around. \n\nSo, I guess my question is for the ladies - do you think this is a sign of something?

A few days ago i got the answer to my test and it showed me being infected with chlamydia, for which I'm now receiving treatment for.\n\nThe thing is, i haven't slept with any other guy in the last year besides my boyfriend, so naturally i confronted him about it. He claims he haven't been unfaithful while we have been together, and he got no answers for how he may have gotten the disease and he is getting a check up at the doctor some time next week.\nNow i want to believe him, i really do, but i just can't shake off the feeling he might be lying. He seems sincere enough and apologizes a lot and wants to make amends. I just can't see any other way for how else he could have gotten it. \n\nAs far as i have read up on chlamydia, it only transfers during sex and the time between symptoms (if you are one of the 1/4 of people who get them) and infection is about a months time, meaning i would have gotten infected about a month ago. \nI just don't deem it plausible that we could have been together for 9 months before i contracted the disease, but to be honest I'm not really sure how chlamydia works for gay people.\n\nSo now i ask you guys for advice. Should i forgive him and trust his words when he says he hasn't been unfaithful or should i dig more into it / perhaps put the relationship on a break, or what should i do?\nTL;DR:"}

Nevertheless, in this past month, I've been hanging out with my friend, this girl and this boy whom she is with it seems (they don't show any sign of affection), and I get the feeling that she, even though she ignored my approachs (messages from whatsapp or facebook inviting her to hang out), she is like sometimes interested in me and always telling me to hang out with them.\nAt first when I was rejected I started to ignore her, and obviously that's when she started to give me more attention.

Her personality and physical tratis were and are extremely attractive, almost intimidating. We dated, we hung out and we laughed a lot. The sexual side was great as well. But there was one problem. She is not a very emotionally open person. I asked her about it a few months ago and she told me it takes a lot for her to open up. I didn't push too hard. I figured it would take some time. \n\nFast forward to this past weekend and the week prior. She had been acting a bit distant and I knew something was up. We met up Saturday with some friends for drinks and eventually things went south. She broke it off with me saying that she didn't feel like we were close enough for being together for 6 months and it wasn't fair to keep going. \n\nI can't force her to have feelings for me but I know the past 6 months wasn't just nothing. I honestly wasn't my open self around her because she wasn't open around me. It's like we were both waiting. I know I should have been more assertive and confident.\n\nI've had 2 somewhat lengthy relationships in the past at about 2yrs each and several flings so this isn't my first rodeo.

One girl studies a medical degree. A couple of times she's gone away on placement for several weeks. It was a compulsory placement where she would be paying bills in a different town where her placement was, and so we reduced the metered bills for her. \n\nBut because she doesn't have anymore lectures, coursework or exams, she's leaving early. There's 3 months left on our contract. She will still be renting her room and paying the rent on it. But what is the fair thing to do with bills?\n\nBecause of how bills work in this country, both of the water bills plus the internet bills will be the same regardless of if we are all here or none of us are here for a period of time during our tenancy. For example if we had all gone home for a month over christmas, those bills would have been the exact same price as they are this month. And with the gas and electricity, there is a daily rate, again which we would be charged regardless of the number of people here or on holiday etc. \n\nDoes it seem fair if the housemate leaving pays for the internet and water plus 1/4 of the standard charge for gas and electricity? Then the bit of the gas and electricity bill that's actually for our usage, is split between the three of us actually here?\n\nAlso, I only found out yesterday that she's moving her stuff out and not coming back anymore. Nothing was agreed/planned in advanced between us all.\n\n**According to our tenancy agreement, we are all jointly liable for bills, so any reduction for her is a nice thing IMO!\nTL;DR:"}

We hooked up then spent the entire night just talking, honestly it was one of the most intimate experiences of my life (I know).\n\nI mentioned he should come and visit and was serious, something about the night just really resonated with me. He messaged me the next day saying what a nice time he had and gave me a few spots to check out in Sydney, and I sadly sorta accepted it might be the last time we would speak for awhile.\n\nAbout a week later, he writes me saying he's probably going to be in town. He had been to a festival last year close-ish to where I live and had managed to get tickets again, and was going to stop by my city before heading on to the festival. I was elated, and he asked if I'd be down for him to stay with me even. I said of course, and then he said if it wouldn't be happening in the next few weeks he'd also been planning a US trip later in the year.\n\nI guess I'm writing this because I'm kind of dumbfounded at how a random hook up has suddenly evolved into something like this.

We've been a couple since we were about 15 years old and have seldomly had rough patches in our relationship. \n\nSince a few months I've noticed that my feelings towards her have changed. Although it sounds clich\u00e9, the best way I could describe it right now is as if she were my best friend or even my sister, not my lover. We live in different cities and live very different lives at the moment; I'm pretty outgoing, like partying and love living the 'student life', whereas she's much more focused on her studies and rarely goes out at all.\n\nI know that I would live a really, really happy life if I would end up with her. Somehow I got the feeling that in the end we belong together, but I'm not sure if the relationship is working right now. When I told my gf about the way I felt she started crying and we agreed we would work on it together. It's been a few weeks since that moment and even though I know I can't force my feelings, I'm not feeling the same way about her as I used to.\n\nSince I've never had these doubts before, I guess I'm just wondering if any of you have gone through this same situation as I have and if you have any advice for me. Should I just wait and see if my feelings for her return or should I stop seeing her, for at least a while? This account is a throwaway since my gf is also on Reddit. I gotta say it feels good talking to you guys about this, I hope you can help me in any way whatsoever.\nTL;DR:"}

We've fought a lot lately but honestly I thought I was going to marry this girl. I also lost my virginity to her so there's a pretty close connection there too.\n\nThis whole past week she said she wanted her space because we'd been fighting a lot. And so I gave her the space she wanted. I didn't really talk to her much or see her at all this week.\n\nI was supposed to take her out on a date to this really nice restaurant tonight and we were just going out with our friends on our own last night. So that happened and then she texted me once she got back to her apartment and told me to come over. I went over there at 2am and that's when she proceeded to tell me she had slept with another guy 3 days ago.\n\nI'm so beyond heartbroken. I honestly thought this girl was the one and come to find out that this happened. I don't even know what to do. I've never felt so low or so shitty about something in my entire life.

Mind you this is the third time its happened, but a different guy every time and never turns physical.

I found out later that morning that she would be home in a few days.

My biggest problem is that I love her, but I'm not sure if I can stay with her.\n\nAlso I am not always the most attentive, I understand how someone would want to seek attention elsewhere.  I just wish these feeling would be discussed before actions.\n\nAny advice please, but keep in mind I really dont want to leave her.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm looking for jobs online, mostly through LinkedIn, Indeed, and the like, and getting really, really freaked out about getting a job back there. I'm not looking to move back until June, so I haven't started applying in ernest yet, but I'm getting nervous at the opportunities (or lack there of) that I'm seeing for what I do (I'd be happy with anything still in marketing, honestly).\n\nHere are my primary concerns: \n\nWill I need to move back east before I'm able to properly apply and interview for jobs? This would require me to quit my current job, which I'm told is a no-no, but not doing so could make moving back difficult logistically.\n\nI'd like to get a pay-bump since I've been making roughly the same amount my whole career (went from 45k to 46k ..yippee..) is this realistic given my somewhat light experience and the more competitive market? Is what I make *now* even realistic?\n\nHow do I even *find* a job? Am I using the right resources? Are recruiters a good option? I should mention I had a tough time finding a job out of college, as many do, and am pretty freaked out by the prospect of having to search again. \n\nBasically, any tips, tricks and resources you guys have to make finding a new job 1000+ miles from where I presently live and work a little easier, would be HUGE.\nTL;DR:"}

My friend, (let's call him Kyle) taught my other friend, ( let's call him Mike) and I, how to make ourselves black out. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. A simple process of kneeling down, hyperventilating, then standing up after about 30 seconds and putting your thumb in your mouth and blowing (like blowing air into a balloon) then you gain consciousness a few moments later. Me being my curious and stupid self, it sounded fun at the time, so of course I tried it in the middle of the class period. So I do everything Kyle told me to do, and just like he said, I woke up from consciousness with my head down on the table. We were all laughing and entertained by this stupid thing to do. So Mike told me to do it again, so I thought okay no big deal, this is kind of fun. So I go through the steps again, and this is where the major fuck up happens. I wake up laying flat on my face, slowly regaining my vision and hearing. I look up from the concrete floor to see the entire class and the teacher circled around me. At this point I was thinking \"Oh shit this is not good\". My teacher grabs me by the arms and pulls me up and walks me to the bathroom to wash my face off. I didn't know why I needed to do that until I saw my face when I looked in the mirror. My mouth and nose were covered in blood, and my tongue kept poking something sharp. I open my mouth to see two of my teeth chipped completely in half. Fast forward about 45 minutes, and my mom shows up, and she is *livid*. She takes me to the dentist to see what they can do, and I get an appointment to get my teeth fixed two weeks later. Needless to say the bill wasn't cheap. And that's my story of making myself pass out in wood shop and costing my mom a lot of money to fix my teeth.\nTL;DR:"}

Ex decides to tell my current girlfriend's best friend about how I supposedly have slept around(I am bi, I have had sex with a man and a woman. I like women more, but there is an attraction. I let my ex know this very late in our relationship). And best friend believed her.\n\nSo, best friend, who doesn't like me already, tells girlfriend's parents.

Her prom (btw we go to different schools, hers is all-girl and mine is all-guy) is next week, and she hasn't said a thing about it until today. My plan was to order a tux this weekend, so I texted her today essentially saying, \"is it safe to assume that I will be asked to prom, so that I can go ahead and order the tux?\" She responded by saying that she does not have time to ask me to Prom so yes, I'm going with her. She does have a job in which she works at least 4 nights a week, and it is nearing the end of the school year so there are tons of homework and finals to worry about, not to mention getting ready for college and everything that goes along with that. So I do understand that she is extremely busy and doesn't have a lot of time on her hands right now, yet I still feel upset that she didn't take the time to do anything or even say something sooner. I would have been completely understanding and okay with something as small as a 5 minute phone call or something like that, but a text makes it seem like she doesn't even care. So my question is: Do I have a reason to be upset or am I being too hard on her for it? Also, for any other high school couples out there who have been dating for awhile, do you still ask each other to prom in cute/funny different ways or is it just a known fact that you are going together?

I've experimented with it before and enjoy the occasional high, but have an addictive personality so I don't use it a lot. Now I'm lactose intolerant and recently found out so (developed it somehow, I'm not really sure) I have not been eating dairy at all for the last few months.

One of my friends delivers pizza and always brings extra so, being the barred out stoner I was at the time, I decided to munch a couple of pieces. About 15 minutes later I take a bong rip and instantly yak on myself after coughing for a couple seconds, then yak again. And again, and again, and again, probably for 10 minutes straight. I had thrown up on my jacket a little so someone got me a trashbag, I put the jacket in it and my brother took me home to pass out. When we got home I put the trash bag next to the trashcans which weren't scheduled to go out anytime soon. My wallet and only key to my car were in the jacket, but it smelled like yak so I left it outside so the house wouldn't wreak. In the morning I wake up and to my great displeasure the bag is gone. The trash is all still there, but my yak jacket has straight vanished. I'm guessing a coyote thought the smell was food and picked it up and took off. Had to get a new car key made which costed $40 and had to get a new license which was $27, as well as a new student ID which will be $70.\nTL;DR:"}

Pretty damn devastating when you're childfree and he feels the same way and there are only so many men that would go for a woman like me (and there are guys with teeth missing or in their 70s that want me, go figure...).  I just couldn't take the distance anymore, and I was so miserable.\n\nI feel like I'm the unrealistic one for wanting someone childfree that is around my area of South Florida because I have a very rough time with long-distance relationships. Do I need to toughen myself up in that aspect? I may be a pretty woman, but it takes me MONTHS to find someone to remotely date at all just for that. Yeah, I know I'm complaining about a decision that I made that has made my dating pool the size of a raindrop, and I have been told to either stop complaining about something I can change (I will NOT change my mind!) or change my mind and cave so some of my buddies who have normal dating lives that are able to find partners quite fast don't have to hear my self-imposed bellyaching.\n\nI know there is hope, but it seems to only be a long-distance option, and it is torture for me to keep pursuing that, because I am a physical person. I can do it again, but he better be CHILDFREE and very awesome!\nTL;DR:"}

Any way summer passes and we feel that that xmas we would officially become a couple. We are very much in love, we get on great, have amazing chemistry, and basically live together at university. We are now having talks that she has been thinking and realises that labelling our relationship has made her feel trapped and pressured because it feels like something shes rushed into because i was upset she didnt want to commit to it by making ti fb offical. However in saying this she still wants to be exclusive with me, she wants to 'be with me' just doesn't want to label us, spend time, go out have sex everything would essentially remain the same...this is the most of my understanding any ways. So shes explained it to me and i said that it doesn't matter what we call our selves as long as we get to be together and nothing changes we can be whatever i have that security in knowing that she wont head back to her ex or want to get with any one else and i just want to be with her.\n\nThe trouble is as a dude...a logical human being, im finding it hard understanding what would change with a label. To me its a psychological thing for her, that she needs to overcome, by being in that situation, but i cant say that for obvious reasons and dont want to make her do anything she doesnt want to, she should be proud to call her self my gf, thats what i want. She acts the same now as she ever had before, and we have just as much if not more fun than ever... so would someone give me a female perspective on this situation, because she struggles to get it across to me.\nTL;DR:"}

We get along well, we have similar senses of humor and both get fascinated by the same random things. We've hung out maybe 6 or so times since she lives across town and we're both pretty busy with school. I would have considered making the move and asking her to be my girlfriend, but she actively avoided the subject a couple weeks ago so I decided to give it some more time.\n\nLately, though I've been having doubts about whether or not we're even a good match. She'll say things that are just generally off-putting, like telling me about her guy friend who is so in love with her that he \"can't say her name without getting an boner\" and will \"repeatedly ask her to have sex\" (actual quotes), but she just laughs him off and claims she doesn't feel the same way. She'll mention how she's going to meet some guy friend right after we're done hanging out. She even FaceTimed one of her \"best guy friends from back home\" while we were both just laying on my bed talking. They were going back and forth, teasing each other and sharing inside jokes, resulting in me third wheeling on our date. Am I justified in feeling weird about this or just overly sensitive?\n\nNone of this would bother me as much if she didn't expect me to treat her like she's my girlfriend. We're constantly texting throughout the day, and she'll FaceTime me randomly throughout the day and get irritated if I don't respond. She has no hesitation to let me pay for pretty much everything. So she seems to want the girlfriend treatment without the label or commitment. \n\nSo my questions are \n1. Am I being too sensitive with the jealousy?\n2. Should I bother pursuing this girl or just break it off?\nTL;DR:"}

So here is the story - I met a girl back in high school, and we became pretty close friends. It's been five years, and our friendship is still very solid. We're able to go long periods of time without chattering, and when we start up again it picks up like it's yesterday. She's someone that's incredibly special to me, and I would not mind at all if she becomes the one that I settle down with. \n\nHere's the thing, we're both going down very different paths, and while she's extremely passionate about sports, I'm passionate about science. Both of us really want to follow our dreams, and as such, it means that we don't really get to see each other, with our primary means of communication being text or the occasional email. Hanging out is very tough for us, as our schedules are both really rigorous. I am willing to wait as long as it takes though, because I want to be together with her. She's someone I care about so deeply on an emotional level. It's strange, because as I've met a lot of beautiful girls in school and all that, I still find this girl to be the one that pops up the most in my thoughts. She's beautiful, she's head strong, and a sweet heart. I want her to be happy most importantly, but at the same time I wonder if she reciprocates some of these thoughts. What is a good way to proceed with this, going forward, to benefit the both of us? I don't want to lose her friendship if I voiced these thoughts. :(\nTL;DR:"}

It was a downtown place and I had just traded my stick-shift SUV, for a smaller automatic car so she could drive it. We had just moved to the city, I had a job and she didn't. When she did find something, I decided to commute to work and let her use my car every time she had to work. At first I took the bus, then I started biking the 10 mile commute. I fell in love with it and things were good. \n\nNow we've moved into a house and finally, have the option to both have cars. The commute is now 15 miles each way, and I think of it now as a chore. There are days when I'm so tired, my only motivation is that I'm running late. \n\nWhenever I bring up that she needs her own vehicle, she gets upset. She eventually says she's looking for a cheap/used moped or scooter. Great! We go to sleep mad at each other, but at least I know she's looking. Money is always a touchy subject (for both her and I).\n\nWell, she's been \"looking\" for about 6 months. I don't bring it up that often because I know it upsets her. We share the gas payments, but I pay the insurance. Which is a lot. \n\nWhat are my options? At this point it seems like my hands are tied and I'm stuck on my bike. Even if I get another vehicle for myself, I have a car that I paid for/am paying for and not being allowed to use when I really want it.

I got home to my empty and dark apartment and just lost it.  I was pacing back and forth, shaking, and could just feel a flood of crying welling up.  I pushed it down as far as I could and thought I could handle it.  That's about when my roommate came home and I went into my room and shut the door and BOOM I just started full on weeping and breathing really heavy.  All I could think about was how much that dog fucking loves me and he'll never understand why I left and probably never see me again. Next thing I know, I'm hyperventilating and fall on the floor.  After about a minute on the ground, my breathing starts to get back to normal - or enough so that when my roommate knocks on my door to ask if I'm okay I was able to shout \"Yeah.  Thanks.\"  The weird thing is that I feel better.  Was it a panic attack?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not an asshole, i'm not going to force her to be uncomfortable.

After all, this sort of thing happens from time to time, and it's usually no big deal.  My friend next to me got a lot of water on his pants when it dripped off the table, so of course we made fun of him for peeing his pants.\n\nBut then my friend's laptop turned off.

So I guess I have a fair bit of relationship experience, but not so much \"dating\" experience!\n\nAfter the breakup I took a little time to be by myself, learn to live alone for the first time ever, and come to terms with everything. The breakup was a long time coming to be honest and I was upset for a while but I've worked a lot on healing myself including therapy, and I can confidently say that I am in a pretty good place now.\n\nAround the middle of the year I signed up for Tinder and got talking to a few guys, went on some dates, mostly fairly terrible (oh boy do I have some horror stories!)... Until I met Mark. Mark is great. He's funny, smart, sweet, and my dogs love him! A lot of the guys I've met on tinder are just interested in sex, but with Mark I can actually have a conversation, and we go on proper dates and have a great time together. Our first date was almost 2 months ago, and since then we have gone out together at least once or twice every week (basically whenever our schedules allow), and we text basically all day every day. I'm not seeing anyone else and I haven't even been on Tinder for like a month. So while things are going great, Mark and I haven't had \"the talk\" about exclusivity, or where things are going; so that, Reddit, is why I turn to you. \n\nHow soon is too soon to have the talk? How do you even do it? How do you start that conversation? Am I just supposed to wait for him to bring it up?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My brother was injured on the job (garbage man) and had his wages cut while on disability, employer is not being cooperative, what to do?\nPOST: So earlier this year my brother was breaking down a matress box spring and had a staple fly into his eye. I think the date was sometime around April. He had to take leave, go in for around half a dozen surgeries, and still cant see correctly. His vision will be permanently blurry in his affected eye.\n\nDuring the time he was going through surgeries he could not work and was paid by workmans comp in CA (something like 75% of his wages IIRC). He has somewhat recovered and has been back to work for the last 2 months or so, doing full duty labor and even driving big trucks again.\n\nNeedless to say finances have been extremely tight for him and his stress level has been through the roof. He has been living paycheck to paycheck for quite some time. So today he noticed on his pay stub that his hourly rate had been docked from $19/hr down to $16, he says it has been that way since 5/1 (right after his accident when he went on leave). He was not notified of this and is extremely upset (he was too stressed to notice before, he just needed the money in the checks to pay rent).\n\nHis company is not union, so I think the pay dock is technically legal. He is still doing routine checkups with the eye doctor and still has to wait until a year passes to get the final word from the doctor on the long term damage and to receive his payout for the damage.\n\nHis employer has a long history of taking shortcuts (no safety program whatsoever) to save a few bucks and has been dicking him around for a long time. He is going to confront him tomorrow about the pay cut. I think soon it may be time for lawyers to get involved with the direction this is headed. Any advice on what to do? We dont have much money at all and with this economy a low level position like that is going to be hard to replace even if he does take them to court. I fear the lawyers fees would almost negate any money awarded from a lawsuit.\nTL;DR:"}

We also mutually tell new acquaintances that we are boyfriend and girlfriend even though the two of us know very well that we are not.\n\nWe both love each other but I have periods of \"meanness\" that are keeping him from committing to me. I sometimes become highly emotional with very sporadic mood changes during these times. I am ashamed to say that some of these instances involve me becoming very angry and mean where I push him away and treat him like garbage - essentially becoming very abusive. These periods don't last very long, and afterward, I go back to being normal as if they never happened, which throws him off and keeps him from wanting to stay together with me officially. I am completely aware of my problem and have sought help and consultation from my university's counseling center. In short, I was told I have a lot of problems I need to sort out and should seek long-term therapy. Unfortunately, I don't have the finances to pay for the therapy I need. As much as I have tried to reason with them, my family is very unsupportive.

I'll be contacting him in a couple weeks to check up on this analyst position, but I don't have lofty hopes.\n\nI feel slightly uneasy because I had to fill out the standard hiring paperwork when I went to interview but it was brushed off as \"everyone who comes through the door fills this out, don't worry about it\". \n\nMy question is this: Do I need to do anything to avoid any kind of fee/legal repercussion that I might not be anticipating? I really don't think I'll ever take a temp job through this recruiter as I feel like the good one was just bait, so do I need to do anything to formally (and legally) break ties if the analyst position is \"filled\" again at the end of April?\n\nThanks in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

Since Reddit is anonymous, I feel like people will not have personal ties to what is happening and thus the input will be more accurate. \n\nI have been dating this girl for roughly 1 yr and 9 months. We are now in college (I'm in Washington [state] and she's in Montana), so distance is pretty far. She's such a nice girl and everything has been really great while we've been dating, but deep down I know she's not the one. She obviously means a lot to me and so I am looking at how I approach the situation to make the best out of it. I think that we both need time to grow as people and think that time apart is the best. I'm not saying a break up is imminent, but I do think that space would be best. I say this because I feel like she has some trust issues and is perhaps a little less outgoing and willing to try new things than I would like someone to be. How would you go about this making it as easy and painless as possible?\nTL;DR:"}

He wrote me on for 20+h less than I worked. Second: He lied to me straight in my face twice. I asked for a 6 month contract. He said yeah okay ill do. On the interview I again asked him \"is this a 6 month contract and not a summertime one?\". He said yes it is. The next week the franchise sends me my contract that I needed to sign and send back.

I went into panic mode because I'm currently in a relationship that I don't want to end, and telling my current gf that I'm a potential carrier might put a damper on that.\n\nSince it was the weekend, I couldn't get tested, so I don't know if I'm a carrier or not. But then, on Sunday, my ex calls her ex and asks him a bunch of important questions that she needs to know to help us figure out when he contracted the virus (he tested clean on his Sept. tests for the military. Does the military test for HIV? I don't know). He claims that he had texted her as a joke, and he is a real asshole, so it's possible. Now he says that he never tested positive for HIV and is clean. \n\nIn the meantime, I'm freaking out still, and my ex-gf doesn't get her results back until later today or early tomorrow. I've done all my research about transmission, and even if she tests positive, I'm incredibly unlikely to have contracted the virus, but I'm still freaking out.\n\nSo, yeah, I just needed to write this down and get a little of the stress off my chest. I've never been this terrified in my life before. It's ruined sex for me, and ruined relationships. I don't know what to do, and there's no one at home I can talk to yet. I figure, if she comes back negative tomorrow then I'm fine (it's been over three months since the single at-risk incident between us). If she tests positive... well damn. Then I guess I go to the local clinic and get a rapid test to figure out if I am too. \n\nOkay, thanks reddit. I needed to tell someone.\nTL;DR:"}

I can't help but feel disappointed.\n\nThis weekend started out great. We went to a friend's wedding on Friday and had a blast. Then we went to the Omaha Zoo yesterday. After the Zoo, we went to a nice Indian food restaurant for dinner. Then for today (our actual anniversary day) we were going to open gifts and go to the nicest restaurant in town. However, this morning I checked the website for the restaurant and it is not open on Sundays. Not a big deal and we decided to just order pizza and drink wine tonight.\n\nThe problem is when I suggested we exchange gifts this morning. It's the paper anniversary, so I made my gift. One was a shadow box with our wedding invite/vows/jewelery/ect. pinned to in the box. I also mod podged the map that we used on our honeymoon in Europe to the letter S (first letter of our last name) and glued/mod podged tickets from the trip, stickers, and trinkets from the trip. Finally, I bought him a replacement wedding band because he lost his about 3 months into our marriage.\n\nAfter I gave him his gifts, he said that he was truly impressed at how thoughtful my gifts were. Unfortunately, he had not gotten me anything yet and was hoping to stop and pick up some succulents when he went into town.\n\nNow, this gift is a rehash of a valentines day gift from 2 years ago. He bought me succulents (which was really thoughtful, because I said in passing that I wanted some) however, during our move this winter, they all died. He thought that was a good gift for our one year anniversary...\n\nI'm just really disappointed...I told him a week ago that all I want is something thoughtful and from the heart.

Once I get to his car, I find him unconscious in his front seat slouched over. I panicked. I grabbed some water and threw it on him to see if he would wake up, thank god he did. Apparently, he remembers getting home around 930pm, but after that he doesn't remember anything. I went out at 12:30, so he had been there for 3 hours... And we don't live in the nicest neighborhood either. I have no clue what he was on, but he could not speak clearly or stand straight. I know he wasn't drunk, because I've seen him drunk countless times; he was definitely on something. With this latest incident, it only leads me to think he has a serious drug problem. About 5 months ago we found a spoon and needle in his jacket pocket, but he claims the jacket was his friends. Not to mention his paycheck is gone within four days, and he sleeps for a solid 12+ hours every day. I know he smokes weed, but I think he is doing more than that. I KNOW he is doing more than that. I seriously need some help reddit, how can I get to my brother? How can I show him he's wasting his life away? My parents have threatened to kick him out, but to no prevail.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by accidentally flirting with my math professor\nPOST: It needs to be pointed out first that I'm pretty shy and socially awkward. I'm the type of person to say good morning at 2pm when someone says hello. \n\nAnyways, so I am taking a 5 week summer course for intermediate algebra and have this fairly attractive female professor. She is probably in her late 20s, early 30s. She is friendly to most students, but a professional friendly, not flirting... The class recently did not do well in an exam and she chose to give an easy quiz the following day to make up some points. I sit near the front of the class, one seat behind the first row, but the seat in front of me is always empty. She decided that she would grade the quizzes facing towards me sitting in front of me, not too close, maybe 2-3 feet away. I finished my quiz and passed it to her, she graded it fairly quickly and showed me I got 100%. This is where it went downhill, she smiled at me while showing me my paper, so my stupid awkward self decided in a split second to give her an awkward thumbs up followed by an even sadder wink... Her smile quickly turned into an expression of disapproval, shock and a hint of disgust. I knew then, I had fucked up...\n\nA little more background on my professor, she had been involved in a situation whereas she was caught having an inappropriate relationship with another student a couple years ago. It was stopped before it became serious, so she only received a slap on the wrist. I was given this information by the dean after she freaked out and sent me there. He was completely understanding of my story and the whole situation. \n\nI go back to class on Monday where I will be sitting in the back, with my head down, solving for x.\nTL;DR:"}

I didn't try to run at him at first cause I thought he would just keep running away. Instead I run away from him hoping he would chase me. After 20 minutes of that and him ignoring me I start following him. Every time we got close I would squat down and get a treat out. He would just sprint right past me. \n\nAfter 10 more minutes of this I just tried chasing him but quickly ended that after I slipped on ice and bruised my knee. That's when I have up and left.

Before exiting our trip, we brought my dog to his usual pet sitter. This is the third time this lady is watching my dog. From past experiences, my dog would usually come home a little different, which I thought was normal (kind of like a jet-lag feeling), but this time is just a lot different. My dog has become SUPER lazy. Like he won't run up the stairs anymore, he won't run to me when I get home from work or school, and he doesn't even get excited when I try to play with his favorite toy. Hes just been super blah. He'll just laying down in one spot and staying there until I MAKE him go outside. When I yell \"Snoopy!\" he usually RUNS to that toy and waits for me to tug-a-war it and throw it so he can chase it and he hasn't done so. I'm really worried about my lil guy and I'm not sure why this is happening or what I should do. If anyone has any insight or recommendations, I'm all ears.\n\nThank you all\nTL;DR:"}

They never seem to worry about North Korea and seem to view them as nuisance rather than a real threat. If Canada was essentially Mordor I'd probably be pretty worried about it, rather than treat it as some dog that craps on your yard from time to time. I'm told that the farther you get from the Korean War generation wise the less they care. Last time I checked a good chunk of the population is within North Korea's artillery range and North Korea's population can be whipped up into a propagandic craze in an instant. I noticed a lot of the same indifference when the Chenoan was sunk and it appeared to me that South Koreans weren't really that concerned. Granted I am an American who only went to South Korea once when I was 14 so if missing something, ignorant or just plain thick please inform me.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: My name is on recently deceased grandparent bank accounts, my parent seems to want to remove any chance of my inheritance\nPOST: Throw away account.  Several months ago my grandparent passed away.  I was extremely close to her.  I called her everyday just to chat about anything and everything.  Over the past several years, she came to the realization that her daughter(my mom) was pretty much putting up with her just for her money.  There had been several times where my grandmother mentioned the idea of removing my mother from her will altogether.  She also put me on her checking/savings account that has a decent chunk of money in it.  After my grandmother passed away, my mom seemed to basically ransack her house looking for the will.  There was a lock box that she found and supposedly there wasn't any money, a will that was dated 25 years ago, and funny enough user manuals for some of her appliances.  Now I know my mom is a habitual liar.  I've come to accept this after catching her and calling her out on countless things.  My grandmother used to ALWAYS keep a few thousand $$ in her house.  Just something that the older generation seems to do. So lie #1.  But I have this gut feeling that there was a different version of the will in that lock box, but it may have conveniently disappeared.  But who knows for sure.  But ultimately my question is with my name on the bank accounts, but my mom's name being on the will stating that she gets everything, does she actually have any right to that money in the accounts that my name is on?  I live in Missouri U.S.  I'm wanting to split it with my brother and give my mom a smaller percentage of it as she is getting the houses and several different investment accounts that add up to more than what I figured would be a fair inheritance for my brother or me...with my mom basically getting ~50% of the overall value of the estate and my brother and I getting ~25%.

I was in one relationship (serious and long-term) and that was initiated by my now-ex. I've been approached, but the last time I told someone I liked them was in kindergarten.\n\nI'm friends with him, but not very close. My interest is fairly recent. I'm very introverted and I have very few friends, just because it's hard for me to warm to new people. This brings up the typical issues of, one, not wanting to lose him as a friend and, two, not making things awkward in our friend group. \n\nWe're both the same year in college, by the way. If this is relevant, I'm also openly bi, which I think might make some people assume that I'm actually a lesbian.\n\nThe other thing is, I don't know the first thing about his dating interests or history. I think he's straight, but I don't even know for sure if that's true (not because he's effeminate, just because it's a silly thing to assume with absolutely no reason).\n\nHe asked me to hang out with him several times and we've spent a few times just me and him watching movies or shows or just browsing Reddit. The problem is, I don't know if this is because he has very few friends as well or not. It could very reasonably be totally innocent, especially if he thinks I'm a lesbian. \n\nThe first thing would be to determine whether he's actually interested in dating and, specifically, interested in dating women. How do I do that tactfully? How likely is it that you guys would assume a girl would be uninterested because she said she was bi? Finally, how do I go about showing my interest? How is best for a female friend to get a guy's attention without hinting around as girls tend to do?\nTL;DR:"}

Just slightly. I have a small bone structure and was skinny as a teen. \n\nAnyways I have had so-called round shoulders since I was made aware of it by my mother around 12 years old. This might sound funny, it's not meant to be but my mother used to say \"Walk with your shoulders back\" and would get annoyed at times when I didn't try make an effort to do this. \n\nAs I progressed through teenage years I was a bit disturbed to find out that people with round shoulders get perceived as having \"no confidence\". Now I would love to say I had round shoulders because I was sitting behind a play station all day or was doing nothing, but actually I was extremely outgoing, and it seems that no matter what I did to correct this, it was just part of my bone structure. \n\nI get the feeling many people have this issue. Some worse than others, but what I can't understand is how it could possibly be linked to self confidence. \n\nIf someone has a \"slumpy\" posture I would think maybe that person is sad or disturbed in some way. Confidence wouldn't be my first thought. But I have to admit I wouldn't automatically think \"Shame that person is like that because that is just the way his bones are\". \n\nMy bones have a naturally relaxed position and have always had this.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Non-Americans of Reddit, How Is Prosecution of Criminal Behavior Different Where You're From?\nPOST: I'm wondering about how significantly the attitude towards certain crimes differs from the attitude in the U.S.A. \n\nHow a crime is pursued/punished in the US varies wildly from case to case. How you're treated depends on things like; where you commit the crime, how much money you have, how the victims or conspirators react, your race, your sex, etc.\n\nHow some \"common\" crimes are treated in the US:\n\nIllegal Drugs - Really depends on the drug and who you are and where you are. If you're a college kid (especially if you're caught by campus police) you can get away with a slap on the wrist at least for pot (but harder drugs too). If you're a poor person (or even worse a poor black person) your odds of being jailed for possession go way up. \n\nBrawling/Fighting - In the US a bar fight can be a pretty serious thing these days. Brawling might land you with an assault charge, some time in jail, community service etc. My room mate is from Germany and he says that in general a public brawl is a fairly minor crime over there. He thinks this is because fighting there is a little more good-natured (people don't generally get stabbed, shot, or beat to death) so  it's not treated as seriously as it is in the US.\n\nPublic Drinking & Underage Drinking - I know drinking in public is not a crime in many/most European countries. Here drinking underage isn't going to get you jailed but you'll probably end up with community service, driving license suspension, and fines. Also it can be a not entirely inconsequential black mark on your record when applying for jobs/schools.\n\nDriving While Intoxicated - In the US this is often a pretty big deal first offenders aren't usually jailed (but you'll often spend the night), license is suspended (for a year is pretty common), you're put on probation, and having a DUI on your record can be very detrimental to job hunting or applying to schools.\nTL;DR:"}

I graduated and got a job, and she is still in her final year of university right now. But sadly things have been deteriorating over the past 3-4 months.

I cook almost every night for her and I assist her with her uni work if she is stuck or could use some advice, but I feel that whatever I do is just not enough to keep her happy. We have such on and off days that it makes me feel worthless or rather that nothing I can do is good enough for her. I have told her how I feel on multiple occasions, but it usually results in her becoming quite volatile and passing the blame on to me, it's almost impossible to communicate with her because she ALWAYS has to be right .\n\nShe tends to be really good at twisting an argument from something she knows has done wrong, but refuses to admit it, in to something about me.\nIs this a case of us moving in together too quickly considering we lived together the entire time we have known eachother? \n\nMaybe it was too rushed and I never saw this side of her.\n\nMany thanks Reddit :)\nTL;DR:"}

I moved from Oklahoma to the middle of nowhere Illinois to fix up a house for my in-laws, after which I am moving to Chicago. In the past I have had pretty shitty credit and have made some bad financial decisions. My credit score is currently in the high 500s, but I'm in the process of paying off my old debt, which totals about $2,000, but it's multiple small accounts from about 5 years ago and older. The only \"new\" credit I have is my car, which I took a loan to buy in '08 and a recent credit card, neither of which have ever been late.\n\nI have never owned a house before, which I understand used to be a good thing, but now I'm not sure. Rent is high in Chicago and based on most mortgage calculators, if I was able to find a foreclosure or home that needed work, my mortgage would be drastically lower than rent would be in most places inside the city. The problem that I have is that there's so much information on mortgages and it seems to change so often that I'm not sure where to begin even looking into it.\n\nI don't want to apply for a loan or anything just to test the waters as it's my understanding that credit checks to open lines of credit will actually hurt my credit.\n\nI plan on having all of my debt paid off within the next month or so and then re-checking my credit score once I no longer actually owe anyone anything that is in collections, but I'm not sure where to start with seeing what requirements will be needed and what programs I should even begin looking into or whether or not I even have a chance of getting a loan this year. If I don't, I'll just look more into renting in the city and put buying off until my score comes up.\n\nAlso, as a final note, I saw a company offering rent-to-own houses in the city and it appears that they offer these for people that are unable to sell their houses due to the market there, and I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with rent-to-own when it comes to homes.

I had to pee SO BAD. It came on fast and it was urgent, probably having nothing to do with the 2 beers I decided to drink while he drove (I know, not my smartest move for multiple reasons). Anyway, I begged him to pull over somewhere. After passing a ton of closed places, we finally find an open gas station. I run full speed into the bathroom, so excited to finally relieve myself.\nThe toilet was covered in shit. Literal shit. I don't know how or why it was like that, but it was REALLY bad. \nI couldn't bring myself to even hover over it. It just wasn't going to happen. But there was no way I could hold it any longer. Then I saw it: a drain in the corner of the bathroom. I don't know why, but it felt like the best idea ever. I'll just squat over the drain and get this done and get back on the road. \nI squat over the drain and start going. It was amazing to finally let it go. Then suddenly I realize that it's not running down the drain. It's flowing to the other side of the bathroom! (Why the floor wasn't pitched towards the drain is a mystery) I shimmy over a few small steps, jeans around my knees trying to get directly over the drain to finish and get out of there. \nThis is when it goes bad. My foot slides, I go into a dance of trying to catch myself and then the unthinkable happens. I fall. Into my puddle of piss. In this disgusting, vile, gas station bathroom from hell.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: A moral dilemma [25M] with [25F] about faith.\nPOST: I have been dating a wonderful, smart and beautiful girl for 3 years now. When we first started dating we both believe in God, but that is no longer the case. She said before we started dating that this was a very important thing to her. At the time I did believe, but over the years I have a different opinion about it. I have been pretending to still believe passively, by attend services with her etc. She is ** NOT** ultra religious, in fact we go to a very liberal church. I want to marry her soon, but I'm not sure how she would react if I told her I lost faith. I know she loves me and we are planning on getting married soon, we are both finishing up grad school right now. (funny she is a biologist). I don't really feel bad for pretending to believe in god for her. But I'm not sure how fair that is to her, knowing that is very important to her.\nTL;DR:"}

However! Tonight I went with my family to the movies, which we hadn't done in quite a while and I WAS NOT looking forward to sitting in those uncomfortable chairs. When I sat down, I was really REALLY surprised. I could sit comfortably and I had forgotten what it felt like to not be embarrassed or concerned and could actually fully enjoy the movie.

I know a little about investing and living frugally, but not much about the advantages or disadvantages of being added as a responsible party for her loans.  \n\nHere is our situation.  She is finishing her Master's degree and should be able to start working in the second half of this year earning between 50 and 60k a year.  I will still be the primary wage earner making around $90k.  My credit is better than hers, but not by much, and we're both have scores over 750.  I have effectively no debt.  \n\nShe has about $70k in student loans.  Right now we are not making payments on them, but plan to begin immediately when she starts working, and dedicate her entire salary to paying them off.  We can easily live comfortably on my salary alone.  We have six months of savings, a healthy 401k, and a small ROTH IRA.\n\nWe share a primary checking account, and keep all of our savings in an ING account that I am the sole owner of.\n\nWill there be any tax (or other) benefits to listing me as a debtor on her loans?  Or would it be better to just leave them in her name without adding me?\n\nThis may be a silly question, but I'm a novice in this area.\n\nFYI, My wife and I are happily married and completely trust one another.  While untimely death is a possibility, ugly breakups and things of that nature are not something we are factoring in.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm now stuck as a volunteer for one year in a small town of 35 thousand in the Czech Republic. The culture here is quite similar to where I come from in western Romania, so I don't get the \"you're a foreigner, let's have sex\" attitude, since i don't really look exotic or out of place here. There's only two clubs here, and they're full of underage girls. What I need is someone more mature, someone who I can have at least a decent conversation with. So my questions is, people who have had experiences with small towns, where do you meet women? There seems to be a severe lack of my age group here, but maybe I am just missing something.\nTL;DR:"}

We both knew we liked each other, but couldn't act on it because I was halfway across the country for school.  We set up a weekend to meet over the winter break, she even invited me to visit her family.  I was stoked.  I get to her place, and the first day is amazing.  Then, she wakes up the next day, looks at me with this strange expression and simply says, \"You're not right for me\", and gets up and simply walks out of the room.

Sorry for the cheesy title, all the rest I came up with were really long run on sentences.)\n\nVery recently someone posted a thread asking about some of the ridiculous things you've been judged for as a parent. I did see several posts about Santa Claus. People wrote being considered \"bad parents\" because they either \"ruined the magic\" for their children by being upfront about the fact that Santa doesn't exist, or showing their kids \"it's okay to lie\" because they believe in Santa. \n\nEnough people wrote about it that it kind of stuck with me. First off, I think it's absurd that anyone would judge a person's parenting skills on how they handle the Santa issue! I mean seriously, why is it such a big deal to them whether or not the parent chooses to let their kids believe in Santa or tell them the truth? \n\nSecondly, everyone seemed to have very different reasons for why they chose the decision they chose, and I thought that was pretty interesting. \n\nSo my question is, for those who celebrate Christmas, does your household believe in Santa, or did you tell your kids from the start that he wasn't real? What was your reason? Do you ever regret it and if so, why?\nTL;DR:"}

It was pretty big, tons of people, cool costumes, so we started walking around, signed in, etc..\n\n I assumed some people there would be a bit nerdy but that's no big deal; however, I was blown away at the awkwardness of most people. We asked a normal looking guy if he knew where we were suppose to sign up for dodgeball and instead of helping, or even saying no, this kid.. I can only describe it as: imagine a cat near water or a vampire in the sun.. He did this shoulder lift, draw back, petrified \"no\" headshake and scurried away like an animal. This wasn't the only one to do this either. Almost no one was able to converse.\n\n We weren't being dicks, but just because we weren't awkward they wouldn't even let us play dodgeball until a little pissed convincing. I mean we were friendly til they were being lame so then we got in the game and won first place, fast.\n\n Anyway, it seemed like everyone there, except the females, were scared to even speak. I tried making friends because I felt bad for some of the guys throwing a dodgeball 8 feet using 2 hands but they werne't able to even carry on the conversation. What's the deal with all of this? Are most fans of Anime and stuff like this? Are most socially awkward people fans of anime? Is it's a visa versa thing? I'm so confused because I might not be nerdy but I'm not a dick to strangers.

He liked to *almost* kill small creatures in the city (typically mice/rats). He would bring them in, I'd get pissed off, snatch them from him, put them in a bag, hit them with my smashing rock that I kept on my small patio, then chuck them in the dumpster.\n\nWell, Danger got wise to my act and stopped bringing them in, instead just playing with them in my backyard, hoping I wouldn't notice.\n\nOne night, I'm just about to fall asleep and I hear that tell-tale sound of a small mouse being swatted back and forth. I get up, grab my headlamp and a plastic bag, go outside and spend about 5 minutes chasing my cat and this mouse around in the dark trying to separate the two but also wanting to catch the half-dead mouse to put it out of its misery. The whole time the mouse is making that fucked up sound a mouse makes as it essentially being tortured to death. Finally, I accomplish this, grab the mouse, and smash it with my smashing rock.\n\nExcept I missed. It was dark and I was out of it. It took another quick swipe but the sound a half-smashed mouse makes is something I don't want to hear again. I go to throw it out in the dumpster in my alley only to realize that I am completely nude. I sleep in the buff and simply forgot to put anything on. But 'whatever' I think, nobody saw me.\n\nFast forward to the next day and my sweet old (~80 years old) landlady stops me in the hallway and asks what I was doing in my backyard the night before. Turns out she was in the apartment above mine watering my neighbours plants while they're away on vacation and watched the whole thing. I tried to explain but ended up giving up and just resigned myself to the fact that my landlady likely thinks I am a serial killer in the making.\nTL;DR:"}

He's in his fifties and has lagged behind when it comes to learning our systems and methods at work. But our biggest issue is with his noises. Whether Jim is watching something on his computer, listening to a conversation, or reading, he mutters and laughs to himself almost constantly. It can be distracting to speak with him because he keeps a running, muttered commentary going as we speak. Over the past few weeks, Angie and I have communicated about how distracting Jim's habits are and how they are affecting our work, and after I mentioned /r/relationships, she (a redditor herself) asked that I make a post here so that we can get some advice on how to handle Jim's behaviors and address the issue.\nTL;DR:"}

She was fully-dialated but our first never made it through, there was no ripping or tearing. \n\nI have read that it goes back to shape after a long enough time but I feel like that is said for women's benefit by male doctors. Some women I have spoken to about it said it is never the same down there. They go on and make comments about the size of it. I have heard men agree underneath their breath.

At that point, I'll go back to the healthy eating and jogging lifestyle. \n\nThanks guys!\nTL;DR:"}

She then came back for another hug showing she was obviously into it... so I did it again. \n\nAnd luckily that right there was the end of the night. Nothing progressed beyond that. After sobering up the next day my wife and I both feel really guilty. My friend has no clue any of this happened. I'm thinking it's best if I leave it that way and never tell him.

The worst though is when she left for winter holiday and left a dozen dishes in varying stages of decomposition in the kitchen.\n\nAnyways, I had a friend over today who brought pizza and a tuxedo mousse cake (inb4 the cake is a lie, you bastards) for a horror movie marathon and to make up a past wrong.

Part of it was mental (13.1 was my previous distance record, and I felt overwhelmed about doing 14), and part was my legs. On long runs as my distance increases, my legs just give out/exhaust themselves even though cardio-wise, I'm completely fine. My legs will be rubber by the end but my heart rate is still around 120bpm (27 yr old female here).

It is the most incredible relationship of my life. Things between us are great, and we love each other a lot.\n\nNow to the issue\u2026\nMy social circle has dwindled greatly over the last couple years, mostly due to the transitory nature of academia. The circle of friends that I did lots of things with doesn't exist anymore, and a couple new circles have formed without me (not that this is an inherent problem). Mostly, I find myself lacking a group of friends that want to go out and do things together. My handful of friends are mostly homebodies, and rarely want to go out. A few of those friends are in a \"new\" friend circle so to speak, and are often doing their own thing. \n\nMy girlfriend has an incredibly busy and fulfilling social life, and her core group of friends are always out doing things together. I wouldn't have it any other way for her, and realize that these weird feelings I am having are my problem and don't have anything to do with her.\n\nBefore we got together, I was in a depressive rut for the better part of a year. I've mostly come out of it, but maybe not totally. A lack of a social life was one of the things that affected me, and I think those issues haven't fully been resolved.\n\nIt's not that I'm jealous of my girlfriend's social life, it's just that it blatantly reminds me that I don't have much of one. And, alongside with wanting to hear about what a great time she had at 'x' or 'y', it also frustrates me because that outlet is greatly lacking in my life.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/running\nTITLE: Calling all users of the Nike+ GPS Sportwatch, what's your experience like?\nPOST: Hey /r/running, I know running watches get discussed here fairly often - I've been reading all the old threads while researching my first GPS watch purchase. However, most threads ask \"Which watch should I get?\" and since most runners here use Garmin watches, the replies are usually Forerunner this or FR that.\n\nI'm trying to decide between a Garmin FR10 and a Nike+ GPS Sportwatch, and so far the Nike looks like the better choice for me based on what I need out of the equipment*. However, I have concerns about the durability. So, if you have a Nike+ watch, how's your experience been? Any problems with the connector? No problems at all? Please share your thoughts!\n\n*Why would I pick the Nike+ over the more recommended Garmin Forerunners? Well, I actually really like the Nike+ website/ecosystem, and I'm not too fussed about being locked into the system. I'm not a competitive runner, so I don't need all the bells and whistles of Garmin Connect or other websites. So, based on that, I'd really like the Nike+ watch, as it ties in with the online service, and it will work with a footpod or HR monitor if I need it to. But, if the replies here confirm my suspicions that the Nike watch breaks all the time, I guess the Garmin FR10 will be the better option. Speaking of, if you use an FR10, have you had any issues with it? How's the waterproofing?\nTL;DR:"}

I worry that we may find ourselves on the verge of extinction at our own hands unless we can unite as a race of beings and elevate ourselves to a higher level. \n\nIn my mind, not only does this bring the promise of sustained existence, but may possibly even facilitate the next step in human evolution, bringing us ever closer to a true global \"utopian\" society. \n\nThe question I pose to you is this- What's going to get us there? What cause, in your opinion, will travel the farthest in the shortest amount of time to prevent our potential impending demise and facilitate higher consciousness of being?

I literally hide my wallet and I'd come home to find my drawers open and my room a complete mess.

Even if I had one, I'm pretty sure they'd keep insisting for them to use it.\n\nIt isn't just money. My mother specifically takes jewelry, perfume, clothing, etc. and anytime I protest it, I get in trouble. My siblings also take clothes, headphones, etc. without asking me beforehand.

I have always held a grudge against this person, and on occasion we will see him at a party. \n\nShe feels that it's too awkward to avoid him, although I see no issue with this and want her to remain completely out of contact with him. \n\nI may have not completely let go of what has happened with this guy in the past, but I know that she would absolutely refuse to let me have any interaction with any of the people that I was talking to while we apart, though she is mad that I don't want her to talk to this guy. \n\nIs she holding me to a standard that she does not want to be held accountable to? And how can I explain this to her if she is without coming off as a jackass?\nTL;DR:"}

We dated about 2 years, fell in love, talked about marriage, babies, and etc. Well about 2 years a go I started to develop feelings for another girl, kissed that girl one drunken night and told my ex. We broke up but decided to get back together again. I did a complete one 180 and treated her 110% better than before. But in the end she just couldn't move past what I did. I understand and I hate myself for it. Know I am scum. \n\nAnyways, here I am a year and a half later. Haven't spoken to her since other than a few text messages and short emails a while back. I definitely have highs and lows but I would say there a are mainly lows. I still think about her non stop. I get very sad and I still have to fight myself to not pick up the phone or get in my car and drive to her house. I have picked up new hobbies, spend lots of time with my friends and made some new ones. Even dated a couple girls but haven't had any luck in about a year. And those girls I went on dates with made me miss my ex even more. What am I doing wrong here. I should be over it by now, its been a year and a half. Any tips or advice? I know we are never getting back together but that's all I can think about.\nTL;DR:"}

Help!\nPOST: I have an apartment lined up for me to move in on the 31st of this month, so this arrangement between my friend and I is temporary. While I am very grateful that she allowed me to stay with her for these 2 weeks while I wait to move into my place, I am realizing that I cannot live with this person without snapping. She is excessively fussy and moves the things I need into places where I can't access them because she's trying to achieve some aesthetic. Most of my clothes are in a suitcase in the closet under her shit, and the closet door is barricaded by a fridge at the moment. If I took anything out of that closet she would flip her shit at me. \n\nAdditionally, she sleeps in absolute darkness which is something I really don't enjoy doing. I'm also a very light sleeper and she has a habit of snacking in the middle of the night and waking up to make sure all the room is still pitch dark and silent. She also locks her door to the dorm room when she's sleeping, and because I sleep later and don't want to bother her with the light of my laptop, getting in and out of the room is kind of a pain. Finally, she keeps fans running at night and the window open making the room extremely cold. As a person with a lot of sinus issues that gets cold easily, I feel like I'm going to get sick at some point if this keeps going. I'm trying to tell myself that this will all be over soon but I feel like she's going to kill me if I step out of line without realizing or I'm going to flip my shit and she won't see it coming.\nTL;DR:"}

They had a constant on and off relationship because he constantly cheated on Kate with a few different girls. They never cut off communication with each other because whenever John would cheat on Kate and that fling wouldn't last he would run back to Kate and beg for forgiveness and she would forgive him.\n\nFinally after their last break up when John cheated on Kate with his now current wife (call her Claire) John wanted to remain friends with Kate. For a few months while John and Claire were engaged they would hang out with Kate and everything was fine, until Claire was convinced Kate was trying to have an affair with John. Kate cut off all communication with John because she didn't want to deal with the ordeal and everything was fine, this was around Easter this past year.\n\nLast week, Kate saw that Claire liked a mutual friends post on Instagram and decided to look at Claire's page, (which I think was a bad decision) and saw that Claire was passive aggressively spreading rumors about Kate saying she is a psycho ex b****. Kate ignored it, and just laughed at it, but mutual friends started sending screen shots to Kate of Claire slandering Kate more and more each time Kate would post something new to her own Instagram account, and eventually Claire started doing the same thing to me even though I have never spoke to her on any occasion.\n\nClaire has also started showing up at the community college that Kate attends and is always everywhere Kate is, and Kate is afraid that Claire is watching her every move. That may be a fluke, but who knows.\n\nI keep pressuring Kate to contact John and tell him about how Claire is treating her, but Kate is worried it would make things worse, so I guess Kate and I are wondering what Kate should do.

I was regularly running 5k in the summer and had starting moving up to 10k slowly.\n\nI hurt it while running in June 2013 and took a few days off and it started hurting again about 30 minutes into the run. I have taken increasingly long breaks to let it heal but it doesn't seem to heal at all. Walking does not bother it at all.\n\nI went to the doctor this past week (I recently moved across the country and was not able to previously), who had it x-rayed and said there was no bone damage. I was told the injury is a result of not properly tying my shoes and the shoe rubbing against my ankle, and to get insoles. I am not sure I believe this advice as the injury is above where a shoe touches. Additionally, I do exercises indoors most days and some days if I am not careful I cause it to hurt again.\n\nDoes anyone know what the cause of this injury is?

Didn't.\nThe class was pass-fail and regardless of your actual percentage in the class you have to get a 70% or higher on the final. Each question was worth was 5%. I got fucking 65% in the class, and went to review the final I ended up putting a negative two when the real answer was positive. I talked to a counselor who, quite to my surprise, was very sympathetic when I told her the situation. She said that sucked, but the best I can do according to the rules is try to apply elsewhere until I complete the class AGAIN. \n\nMy question to you, fair redditors, is how I break this to my parents?

But, it's sitting in the family member's kitchen. So, I call to explain this. They called UPS and UPS told them that the package was picked up and never made it to the UPS shipping location.

I am the type of person who craves recognition, reassurance, attention of any kind from my lover- and he has made it clear that he is very uncomfortable giving verbal compliments... it feels cheesy and awkward and fake to him.  \n\n99% of the time, I initiate sex/kisses/cuddling... about 1/7 sexual advances are accepted... so 6/7 times he doesn't look back at me, doesn't kiss back, or lays in bed like a freaking statue.  \n\nI am desperately trying to find a way to CALM THE FUCK DOWN. I have never had this problem in previous relationships... and I feel completely psychotic. HOW DO I LOWER MY SEX DRIVE?  \n\n  \nAs far as I know, his sexual needs are met and he is happy. That + his introverted nature allows him to feel comfortable, never needing to talk about ANYTHING in regards to our relationship.  \n\nBecause he is fine, all the time, I'm just sitting over here feeling totally insane. I don't want to be a crazy girlfriend. I want so badly to make him happy, and I have no idea if I am or not. I should just take the fact that he is choosing to stick around as his way of communicating that to me.  \n\nSorry this turned into a bit of a rant. Mostly I'm looking for any advice on how to cope with dating someone with a completely different sexual appetite... is there a middle ground where both or our needs can be met? Help.    \n\nPossibly relevant info: We've been dating 1.3 years, are in love, rarely fight.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm worried that our relationship is already starting to get stale.\n\nI'm getting us an extremely nice hotel room, and bought him a $90 bottle of scotch. I need some ideas on how to make the evening itself romantic, and exciting **(that hopefully don't cost very much money [or any at all]).**\n\nIt's not even just that I want it to be romantic, honestly. I just need something that will spice the evening up, and remind him (and me) that just because we're moving in together and just because our relationship has become a routine of sorts doesn't have any impact on the spark we have.\n\nI don't know...just any ideas on how to make the night memorable and whatever would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

While I'm well aware that we don't own anyone and she has every right to date who she pleases, she seems to take delight in sharing the details even when we have expressed that we would rather not hear about it. It got so bad in one case that she almost jeopardized her friendship with her roommate over one guy that her roommate still had feelings for. \n\nNow she's thinking of hooking up with a guy I had seen in the past, but he wasn't particularly nice to me (was very jealous, degrading, etc.) so it sort of makes me a bit uncomfortable that she is seeing a guy that had hurt me in the past. Either way it's just starting to get... weird, and she gets mad when we tell her we don't want to hear about these things. I'm not sure if it's just me being immature or if I have a right to sort of be weirded out about it, because it's not the first time she's done it, and honestly after the deal with her roommate I lost a lot of respect for her because she always seems to prioritize men over her friends. \n\nSo I guess the question is whether or not I should start distancing myself, or if I should talk to her about it. I tried talking her out of seeing the guy her roommate liked, but she specifically told me she would do what she wants and didn't want to hear it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/pettyrevenge\nTITLE: Annoy my friends with concert filming? Two can play at that game.\nPOST: So this NYE I was lucky enough to go to a concert in my hometown with my girlfriend and best friend, both of whom live in different cities. We arrived at the venue a little late but were able to find an awesome spot in an aisle on the first balcony and we were beyond stoked for the show to start. \n\nRight as the lights dropped for the main act to start, a drunk dick face (who shall now be known as DDF) with a camera stumbles his way down the aisle and wiggles into the space between the step my gf and bff are standing on and myself. \n\nFor the next song and a half (which are long because its a jam band) DDF holds his camera up and over my friends' heads all whilst bumping his elbows into the tops of their heads. I could tell my gf and bff were getting increasingly annoyed and it was really killing the vibe of the night so far. \n\nImmediately my blood starts to boil, not only is DDF filming the concert in the most ANNOYING fashion imaginable, but also the large amount of alcohol he had consumed completely skewed his concept of personal space. At this point, my mind was somewhere between grabbing his camera and smashing it in front of him or just socking him in the back of the head. But then I had an idea for my pettiest revenge yet. \n\nI whip out my phone, reach it over his head until it's\n right in front of his face, and begin bumping my elbows into his head. I had turned the tables on him, who's the hot shot videographer now? You're in my world now, grandma. Every time he attempted to move his head in any direction I was never far behind with my extremely bright screen and extremely large elbows ruining his footage and constantly nudging him. \n\nThis continued for about 3 minutes until he had gotten it through his drunk, dickish head that I would not stop unless he leaves. Eventually, he put his camera down, gave me an awful look, and stumbled up the stairs to find his next victims. All I could do was smile and think, \"Fucking sucks to have some film over you doesn't it, dick face?\"\nTL;DR:"}

I told the coach to control her parents or they would have to leave the field, and she did, then not even 5 minutes later, they started talking crap, AGAIN.

At half time I called over a board member from the league, they told the coach that if there were any more problems I could end the game and cause them a forfeit.

I am 26F, he is 27M; we have been together for 2.5 years, and became engaged in July.\n\nWhen I was away for the summer, my fiance, \"Matt,\" smoked some of my weed. He confessed, and I told him that it was okay, but that he should ask me before he took any more. However, two weeks ago, he secretly took the rest of my stash while packing for the bachelor party of his best friend, \"Luke.\" \n\nI was very disappointed when, upon returning the next day, Matt told me what he had done. It was insignificant materially, yet he did compromise my respect and trust. He said that he declined to ask my permission for fear that I'd say no. I responded honestly that I would have given it to him so long as he'd asked nicely. \n\nMatt was repentant. I forgave him, and insisted that he replace what he took as well as speak with Luke, who is wise and kind and whom Matt respects deeply. I want Matt to know that my forgiveness, while sincere, isn't cheap (I've made it so on other occasions). I also hoped that he would make himself accountable to someone else, as incidents that conspire between us alone are too dismissible. I haven't mentioned it to anyone until now.\n\nThis morning, I asked Matt whether he had followed up on these requests. He said that he'll meet someone tomorrow about the weed but bristled about talking with Luke. When I said that it's important to me, he said that it isn't my prerogative. So, is it fair to press the point, or should I let it go? I have no qualms about Matt himself: he is generous, intelligent, and loving. Further, and tellingly, he's often ready to sacrifice his wishes for mine. Either way, I want what's best for long-term mutual fairness and goodwill.\n\nThank you!\nTL;DR:"}

After figuring this out I called my dad and when we started talking about it I said if my step mom wants to come she obviously can, but I explained the limitations on the number of seats we can get. But I told him how when my fianc\u00e9 graduated (same school) they had a separate room set up that televised the graduation that the rest of the family can sit in. My grandparents, fiances mom, step dad and others will be going there!\n\nAlmost immediately he started saying how he would just sit with my step mom in that separate room because she won't want to be alone (this is all his words! not hers).

I came home from college and losing the weight stopped.  I walked less, half heartedly played Wii, and went to snacking.  Overall, I do weigh less than when I got out of school, but I'm just not feeling it.\n\nBut this weekend, I went shopping with my best friends and I was really upset that I wasn't able to buy clothing from the same stores they did. They're both around an 8 or 10 (US Women's pant/dress size) and definitely healthy and average, and I'm about an 18/20, down from a 24.  I had to get bra sized because mine doesn't fit because of the weight loss, and surprisingly I went up a cup, but down around.  Bras are hard.\n\nI don't see my results in my body.  The only noticeable difference I see is in my clavicles.  My friends and my mother say differently (I wish I was bold enough to post pictures, but sadly, I'm not).  Does anyone else feel like this, even having lost a large amount of weight?\n\nMy original goal was to be at -50 lbs by the time school starts, which is the end of August.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to lose over 15 lbs by next month, but I'm certainly going to try my hardest.  Today I got up at 8:15 am to try and beat the heat while out walking 3 miles.  Tomorrow I'm going to get up at 7:15 to do it again, and hopefully not get so burnt.  This isn't the ideal way I thought I'd be spending the last few weeks of summer, but **I want this**.

I think of myself more as a romantic than some other type of guy. I am very considerate and kind. She is the most kind girl I have ever met and she has a refreshingly amazing and intelligent personality. She is super shy around most people even though she has absolutely no reason to be. She is also extraordinarily beautiful.\n\nLet me make this clear: **I WANT A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP, NOT JUST SEX**\n\nSo, I have known this girl in school for about a year, but we just recently started talking and we have a lot in common. My friends that know her have been encouraging me to ask her out. For some reason I feel emboldened right now and I want to ask her to dinner and a movie or something pretty low key. I don't know what would be a proper amount of time to wait (or not wait). I do believe that the feelings are mutual too. \n\nAnother thing is that my family is going on a trip over the holidays... should I ask her before I leave and give her time to think, or should I ask her after I get back? She likes scifi and stuff so I was thinking about asker her to see the Hobbit? Also would it be to early to give her a small Christmas present?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Dating after cancer: When to bring up?\nPOST: In an effort to keep this short: I had cancer when I was 22.  Did the whole chemo/surgery thing.  The cancer is in remission.  I'm 26 now.  The cancer screwed with my emotional state, confidence and social life, but I think I've recently come to a point that I have worked through those issues and have what is probably a more developed social life since the diagnosis and possibly during college.  I'm naturally an introvert, but I get out with friends and have been pretty successful in my job that requires a bit of interaction with others.  This is to say that I don't stay in a closet and I think I am a pretty well adjusted guy.  But when it comes to women I am interested in or attracted to, I become stupid (as in I can't spit the words out of my mouth and am probably a bit awkward, not that I do mean/offensive things).  I've never had a girlfriend before or really even dated due to my own passiveness, but I recently went out on a coffee date and conversation flowed easily for 3 hours and we have an upcoming second date.\n\nSo my question is: when and how is the best way to approach talking about my cancer history?  And specifically, how do I get into some of the more personal side effects that I havnen't discussed with anyone besides a doctor, namely that I have retrograde ejaculation (sensation and ability to have sex is there, but I only 'shoot blanks') and only have one testicle.  The 18 inch scar on my torso doesn't bother me and have no problem with that.  The only other side effect is nervousness/slight anxiety around the time of my 6 month checkups and CT scans, but that isn't really a big deal anymore.  Some of those things like inability to have children seem like weighty discussions I think are a little too soon to have.  But I don't want to keep the cancer history a secret since I otherwise don't have any problem talking about it.  And for the women out there, what would your reaction be to being told these effects?\nTL;DR:"}

One small 3 month break in between but things seem to be much better since we got back together! We have such a great time together and I can honestly say I am in love with this girl and her 3 year old son.\n\nProblem: She has never given me any reason not to trust her but the other night, I went through her phone because I had a bit of a bad feeling since she started working this new job at a bar and she is always working until 3-5AM. Well I this first thing I see is text between another guy.. I cant remember the exact words but basically they were joking about having sex in the keg cooler..Basic flirting back and forth. One text from him said \"Your so hot, meow\" and her response was..\"Your hot, meow\".. This crushed me.. I have immediately confronted her about it and she told me it was nothing but a joke, she says that he told her a story about his exGF where she told him she dreamed that they slept together in the keg cooler so she found that funny, so thats what they were joking about.. Something just doesn't sit well with me about all this. Even if it is a joke, is that really something you should be saying to some other guy? Am I wrong for being upset about this.. What pisses me off the most is as soon as I brought this up she throws all this shit in my face about how she thinks I am talking to my EX still(Who lives 300 miles away..) and I still have feelings with her and all this bullshit... What in the flying fuck should I do..\nTL;DR:"}

I usually only watch a select few players but recently someone mentioned that an ex pornstar plays the game and makes a living off of it which piqued my curiosity as to how she has a large enough audience to make a living, so I ended up going to a video of one of her streams.\n\nNow, my girlfriend is a VERY insecure person and to say porn has been a sensitive topic in the past would be a large understatement. She ended up seeing my YouTube history and saw that I watched this ex pornstar's gaming video clip and wants to break up over it. I think she's way over reacting and am very surprised at how much this ended up hurting her (she cried all night because she felt sad we were breaking up), but here's some details about our past and some details about the video.\n\nIn my defense:\n- I only went to the video to confirm my suspicions that girl streamers(someone who streams themselves playing) usually shows off way too much cleavage to get guys to follow their streams and donate money\n- I watched the clip for less than ten seconds and left\n-The girl was attractive, sure, but I never thought of her sexually...\n\nIn my girlfriend's defense:\n- I've said in the past that a girl who plays video games is attractive to me\n- I told my girlfriend I'd never watch porn (I'd still say I haven't)\n- I've done some questionable things in the past in this relationship but never have cheated on my gf\n- I used to watch porn a lot\n\nI've tried explaining to her that I didn't watch the video to masturbate to it or anything like that but she's not having any of it.

I'm doing really well moving on, but it's extremely obvious she still has feelings for me, and it's making it hard for me to get back out there since I feel we're both caught up in a game of cat and mouse. After a couple weeks, I decided to unfriend her on social media. A few days ago she added me back on Snapchat, and within an hour posted up a story with her new relationship. I didn't open it since I could tell from the thumbnail, and it didn't bother me. Today I posted a story of some friends and I hanging out, and she didn't view it. It's obvious both of our behaviors are making an impression on each other. I know it sounds ridiculous reading into things so much, but she has done a lot of little things ever since the break-up to try to get some sort of reaction out of me.\n\nIt doesn't help that my female friend says my ex always stares at her when they see each other, and I really don't want there to be any drama. There's no hard feelings on my side, and I don't want her to keep any unhealthy animosity. I want both of us to be able to move on and let go of the past. Part of me wants to speak up and say we need to stop this, as it's unhealthy for both of us.

Last month she got a job, working nights, and with my school and work we're only able to see each other once a week: Sundays. It was alright for awhile, but now the last 2-3 weeks she's been texting and calling less and less, not initiating sex when I'm over (she usually does at some point) and when we are together all she does is talk about work and how horrible it is working so late, and how tired it makes her. When I ask her what's wrong, she just smiles and says that everything's great. I don't buy it. She smiles less, talks less, laughs less, doesn't say she loves me even when I tell her I love her.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Problem with Home Improvement Contractor\nPOST: Last month I contracted a local, state-licensed home improvement contractor to build a small room in my backyard. They took measurements, made a design and site plan, and applied for a building permit. The permit wound up being denied by the city for being too close to my house's property line. I could have applied for a 'variance' (an exception to city building codes that would have allowed the project to continue), but after talking directly to the city, it seemed unlikely that the city would approve the variance. Seeing no other option I cancelled the project and the contractor demanded to be paid over $1500 for his expenses and time. Project never got off the ground, no ground was broken and no materials were ordered.\n\nMy beef is that the contractor should have known what the building zoning codes were to begin with and not made a design that would be rejected automatically by the city. If there was a chance that building the room would be a problem I think the contractor should have let me know ASAP. I didn't find out about the property line problem until the permit was rejected by the city. I'm pretty ticked off and was wondering if I had grounds for legal action (contractor kept part of my down payment). \n\nIs it not the contractor's responsibility to know state, county, and local building codes before submitting a design and applying for a permit? I know that he has incurred expenses, but I think that if he had been more knowledgeable of zoning/building codes, those were expenses that could have been avoided altogether.\nTL;DR:"}

His lawyer told him to plea no contest and while sex offender was going on his record, they worked out a deal where battery is all that went on the public record.\n\nWe went to a restaurant for lunch to discuss what happened. He didn't go into much detail and said his pension was taken from him. I told him I would have been happy to testify in court for him and he shrugged it off. I told him in the eyes of the court, pleading no contest is the same thing as pleading guilty.\n\nI asked if I could bring my pup with us for Thanksgiving and they said that's fine but wanted their dog and mine to meet before hand. I said okay! Thinking it's only common since that his wife would be there too. She wasn't.\n\nI knew he wouldn't do anything but I felt it was disrespectful of him to have me there without his wife present. He sent pictures of the dogs on his cell to her then she called on the landline. He asked if she wanted to talk to me and she said no.\n\nThat made me uncomfortable times two!

I'm not sure if I want to go to law school even, my GPA is a 3.3 from a city college, which isn't THAT great, at least for me. I'm looking for a job in the business field and am having no luck so far. I'm dead set on continuing my education at some point, possibly law school or business school, but right now it's not something I want to do. My parents pressure at this point isn't helping. They think I'm basically a fuck up because I haven't \"accomplished\" anything in the four years I went to college and don't have a plan. They also say that my brothers in my fraternity will stop associating with me once they get money if I don't have as much as them since many of them are going for their MDs. I don't think it's true but it's something that scares me since it happened to my parents where their friendships were ended because of money (my parents weren't making as much money as their friends). It also doesn't help that my parents are in a financial hole right now and my father has to resort to driving a cab until he can find something else to do.\n\nI currently work in retail, so it's not like I have no job, but this isn't something I want to keep doing after college. Almost all the people I work with I feel are completely beneath me. Looking at a bunch of them, I can tell that I'm better than this. I really have no idea what to do with my life and this is completely stressing me out. Especially since I just got my first girlfriend. I know that most likely we won't get married, but my whole mindset about money changed. I look at money as a way to support the possible future I may have with this girl, even if we don't get married.\nTL;DR:"}

She lives in the USA and I live in the Netherlands and see each other about 4 times a year. At least, we try to. \n\nAs of now, I am paying all of my trips alone. Which are usually around the 500-850euro price range. Because I come way more often to the USA than she is coming to me, I thought it would only be fair if I asked her to partially finance my trips. \nI was planning to ask her last march, when I was with her at her college. But I guess I didn't have the balls.\n\nHowever, now I did. Last night actually. \nWhen I asked her, she didn't say anything at first. So I looked at her and she said to me that she hoped that I didn't expect an answer right away, and that she had to think about it.\nSo now I am just basically waiting for a response from her.\nIs it a good idea to bring it up again tonight?\nAlso, I told her that of course I would be financing her trips to me as well. I said that I wanted her to finance my trips partially, or come to me more often. Her reply was that her not coming to me more often is because of money. However, she worked all summer long (I had an internship, in the USA, unpaid though, and I had to pay for my travel expenses), and she is going to work while she is at college. Her college is fully paid for by her parents. While I have to pay for my own college, health care and all my other expenses in the Netherlands.\n\nAny tips/thoughts/opinions? Or anything? \nAs always, thank you SO much.\n\nLink to previous post:\nTL;DR:"}

If you haven't checked out these sites, I suggest doing so: \n\n[Help Exchange] [Work Away] and [World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms(WWOOF)](\n\nThese are websites that match up travelers with locals who are looking for help on their farm/ranch/property in general in exchange for free lodging and (usually) meals. \n\nSome jobs I've seen include picking crops, clearing brush, taking care of horses/livestock, working in hostels, building restoration,  and even some looking for native English speakers to interact with children to help them better learn the language. \n\nYou won't be paid for any of the work ~~(which allows you to not even worry about obtaining a work visa)~~, but all offer some form of lodging.  This lodging may as nice as your own private bedroom or as primitive as a tent to sleep in.  The vast majority also include meals on the days you work.  \n\nWorking hours usually end up being about 4-5 hours, 5 days a week so opportunities to travel after work or on weekends are abundant.  Some hosts even offer to take their guests on sightseeing tours of the local area.\n\nSince food and lodging are generally the biggest travel costs after transportation, doing these gigs can save you a ton of money and let you travel for longer periods of time while being immersed in the local communities.\nTL;DR:"}

Again. \n\nWe decided to let him out last year since he showed interest in the outside world, and the first few times he was outside he would immediately go hide under the house and stay there for a day or two. We'd have to go look for him every time as he didn't seem to want to make an effort to come back on his own. We figured he had found a food source.\n\nSo fast forward a few weeks of this happening and we let him out one day, but he doesn't come back. This time he went missing for two weeks and we couldn't find the little thing. We figured maybe one of the neighbors had taken him (this happened once. We went around asking if they had seen him, and they all said no, but coincidentally about an hour later, here comes kitty running back to the house. We assumed someone did take him and let him back out when they realized he had a home, even though he had his collar on), and even though we missed him a lot, we wanted to think he was safe. Well at the end of the two weeks the little fucker appeared outside our house looking like a little kitty skeleton. We haven't let him back out since. \n\nA vet visit revealed he was allergic to flea bites >_> but otherwise he's got a flea collar on, he's got his shots, he's fixed, and is back to normal weight. He's a lot more energetic now and is asking to be let out again. One of my worries are the neighborhood dogs. My neighbors let them roam around in packs, and even though my cats (we have a well-adjusted outside kitty) stay in our yard, we don't have a fence and the dogs have chased my cats a few times. We can easily hear them and go outside to chase them out, and the cats have plenty of places to hide, but it's still a worry of ours. \n\nGiven the info in my novel here, you guys think I should let him out?\nTL;DR:"}

However, every time you walk into the apartment the dishes are overflowing and garbage/backpacks/books are all over the floor. I'm in such an uncomfortable position because I don't want anyone here to hate me or think I'm this anal freak but having a little courtesy would be nice.

Not only was this even further south (by half an hour) than we had planned in traveling, but the only thing they offered us was a $25 credit on our account!

Like a third date rule? I mean, yes I'm diabeteic, but I often forget. I don't tell people because it's no big deal to me. I take my medications and don't eat sugar. I don't get lows so there is no fears of passing out so is there really any reason to warn people? As for my bipolar, yes, I believe eventually a SO should be informed about why I take so many pills. But until you have established a relationship why should it matter? I haven't gone out of my way to tell all my friends and post it on facebook. I didn't feel I was doing anything wrong by not telling him. But he feels like I was hiding some huge secret that would have made him turn tail and run.

Then i decided to go onto hormonal birth control. 2-4 days after starting, everything went downhill. I lost all want for sex, i was always dry, i didnt even want him touching me.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (22F) am having cold feet whether or not go to my best friend's (22M) going away party\nPOST: Some brief background: me and my best friend didn't exactly had a clean start when we got introduced. Originally, we were set up by a common friend because we were both looking for a hookup. But then he started to grow on me because we hung out a lot more than screw each other and during the two years that we knew each other, I confessed that I liked him and wanted to see what happens if we date for real. I got rejected on four separate occassions (I should be nominated for a martyr role). \n\nLast year, he left the country to attend university. It was nine months long and during that time, we didn't talk for a month. This was because I told him that I have to fix my feelings with him. I only got back to talking with him when I met someone and thought I was finally okay. But then I was left heartbroken. At my most vulnerable state, he came back; along with my feelings for him.\n\nNow the question is, while I am positively sure he will never be into me and is unaware that I still like him (even if we did screw around a few times after he came back), I am best friends (and likewise) with the guy and he would be devastated if I just stop hanging out with him moreso since leaves in a few days. But I think that distancing myself away from him would save me from my anguish that I'm still in love with him.\n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

I have a friend who I'm close with, (um we'll say George). George is 27 and I'm 26. These are the things that mess with my mind about George:\n-him sending me songs fairly often, that he 'just knows' I'd love (usually sentimental-ish ones that I do love)\n-an awkward, never spoken of drunken night in which the dance floor got a little out of hand and the dancing turned not really friend-like \n-another drunken night in which he confessed that he would 'REALLY' miss me on his trip he was leaving for and kissed me on the cheek\n-Insisting that I stay at his place when I come back to Vancouver to visit (I moved an hour and half away) \"because it's so convenient\" (this is not true), and us alone having very long, intimate conversations (he tells me things he hasn't told anyone)\n-At the risk of making him sound kind of creepy, I catch him staring at me sometimes (haha)\nAll these things sound fairly clear, BUT on the flipside:\n- He talks to me about other women often. Like enough that I don't understand if he's just come to accept that I'm with someone else and sees me as a guy, or he's genuinely wanting advice, or what?\n\nSo guys, I have debated if I should go for my friend but the fear of him not even actually being into me has stopped me from doing anything about this. I do like him. If I knew what he thought I might actually let myself consider any forward motion from here. I wouldn't do anything with him until I end things in this relationship which I'd need to think over, but I just would like input if I'm way off that he's interested in me as more than a friend. Should I say something?\nTL;DR:"}

Recently though I've been starting to notice feelings for her, and I'm worried about what might happen if I tell her.\n\nThe main thing I'm worried about is that we are going to be living in the same house next year, so if the feelings aren't mutual, it's going to make living together a lot more awkward. Also, I'm concerned that if we do get together at some point, we're going to break up while living in the same house and that would be a pretty terrible living situation.\n\nI should also say that I told her some of my feelings last fall, and back then she didn't want to date because she was afraid it would ruin our friendship. But recently, I feel that the situation has changed because I think she's been flirting with me. It's nothing too overt, but we've been hanging out alone more often than we ever have, and just recently she was doing some provocative stretches while I was in her room. \n\nKeep in mind, though, that I am not very experienced with dating and/or relationships. I've been on a few dates before, but it never lead anywhere serious, and I've never had a GF before. I've been told a lot by my friends that I'm kinda clueless when it comes to attention from girls, so I'm not sure if I'm misreading her signals or just looking for something that's not there.\nTL;DR:"}

I've always tried my hardest to love her the best I can and couldn't work out why she would do this, it seemed so unlike her. After spending time thinking about it, I realised I loved her more than anything, agreed to forgive her and move on. Everything seemed back to normal.

I said no and told him if he wants to leave to pack up and get out. that's exactly what he did. \npart of me just keeps telling me he is gonna come back and the other half really doesn't want him too. how do I make sure that he doesn't come back?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My friend's boyfriend shot and killed himself on Tuesday, how do I help her?\nPOST: He was struggling with severe PTSD and Depression, was on heavy medication and was going through weekly therapy.  For years, he used alcohol and cigarettes as a way to cope. When they met, however, he struggled to stop his alcoholism (a 24 pack a day kind of alcoholism) for 2.5 years.\nA month ago, he and I spoke briefly about how he was getting along with the changes and he said he had never felt better.  And the last time I saw them, we were all sitting about laughing and talking in a coffee shop.\n\nTuesday, with no warning, no note or goodbye to anyone, he got into his truck in front of his apartment, and shot himself dead.\n\nMy friend is one of the types to blame herself.  Her insistence on his \"getting better\" will make her believe that she pushed him to do it.  When it comes down to it, the night terrors, PTSD and general depression ought to have done it (we are waiting on toxicity reports).  But nonetheless, she will blame herself.\n\nHow do I help her deal with her loss? If she isn't around people, I'm afraid she will isolate herself and spiral into a deep, guilty depression.\n\nAny advice from people who have had something devastating like this happen?\nTL;DR:"}

Im going to be blatently honest here. I'm in a FANTASTIC relationship with an amazing girl. She is the longest standing relationship I've had by a mile, and we don't *click* on every level, but I feel a lot like Monica and chandler from friends. In the sense of we aren't perfect, but that makes us special in a way. We love each other very much and we RARELY get into fights *I remember only two, she says three*. But tonight ,long story short, she may have sex with a guy if he has a GF, maybe. The verbatim is \"I want to say no, but I can't be for sure\" I am a VERY long standing believer of *she cheats once she will cheat again* and its not her cheating on someone herself, but helping someone cheat.

We are both in college, but are trying long distance. I stayed in-state and went to a fairly inexpensive college. He decided to go out of state to a pretty expensive school, and his parents warned him during this past summer that besides paying for college, they were probably not going to support him financially throughout the school year. We both received a generous amount of graduation money, but I got a job to have a bit more spending money for the summer. He, on the other hand, chose not to get a job, even after his parents said that they would reconsider cutting him off if he got a job. There were times that I would put a job application in front of him and then later find it crumpled up in the back of his car. That's not even the worst part. Most of what we did during the summer, I paid for because \"all the money [he] has needs to go towards college and [he] can't afford to spend his.\" I'm worried that this is going to continue to be a trend (he says he's going to try and get a summer internship, but who would hire a guy with no work experience?!) and I joined reddit because i need some advice on a) how to bring this topic up to my boyfriend when I see him over winter break and b) what I should do A little tidbit of information about my boyfriend that may be important to know is that he has aspergers. I'm not exactly sure if that accounts for anything, but I figure I should point that out.\nTL;DR:"}

We were friends for quite some time before we started dating, and care about each other a great deal, but the truth is that our relationship was highly dysfunctional. Her ex had treated her quite badly and done some extraordinarily traumatic things to her, and we never quite got over the trust issues surrounding that. Towards the end we were fighting more or less constantly, and I used a opportunity to relocate for work as an excuse to end things.\n\nSince I moved out about a month ago, we've been in more or less constant contact. She's always been a kind of needy person, and I tend to be the type of guy who really loves being needed (whole lot of pathetic flying around these parts), and to be fair, her life has been pretty rough lately. In addition to the stuff between us, she's been dealing with unhealthy quantities of family drama, her car slowly destroying itself, and the death of a pet. I let her use me as an extra crutch but started to feel as though I was dependent on the connection, so I cut her off after a long phone call a couple days ago. I've had a hard time eating and sleeping or really doing much of anything since. I feel guilty for hurting her again, and unfortunately I do still love her, so I keep wondering if I made the right choice.\n\nWhat do you think, reddit?

Unfortunately I think I'm going to screw it up.\n\nI haven't been in many relationships before, just the typical high school and college dating. The problem is, two of my past girlfriends cheated on me. To make matters worse, they were the first girl I ever said \"I love you\" to and the girl I lost my virginity to.\n\nNow, I'm fully aware that the past is in the past, and I was young and these things shouldn't matter that much. My biggest problem is that they do. Even though I know that my current girlfriend wouldn't do anything like that to hurt me, there's a stupid voice in my brain that's paranoid, afraid she's going to find someone else even though she shows absolutely no signs of it and has given me no reason to doubt her. I over-analyze every little thing, even when there's nothing there. It's not fair to her because she didn't do anything to deserve it, and if I could turn it off I would because it would make both our lives easier. She can tell, too, and it's caused a few fights between us even though it's not even a real issue.\n\nSo please, if you have any advice on how to prevent my unjustified paranoia from ruining the best relationship I've ever had, it would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Didn't bother to participate in on-campus recruiting because I had been promised a job with the place I had spent the last 2 summers working an internship for (municipal gov't).  Got whacked by a hiring freeze, though, so no job.\n\nHad thought about joining the Army (OCS), but found out I couldn't pass the medical after I had spent more than a year preparing for it (dropped from 280 lbs to <200, but nobody told me eczema was a prohibited condition).\n\nEventually got some money together and started my own business in 2012 (had been kicking the idea around since late 2010).  Things have not gone well, frankly.  Had some decent success earlier on, but I'm just going deeper and deeper into debt, and my family is no longer able to support me financially.\n\nHow do I get a real job now?  I have no references (haven't had a boss or co-worker since 2008).  I have some decent domain-specific expertise/knowledge, but I don't have much (tangible) to prove that.  My main issues have been managing my supply chain (got tied to an unreliable vendor - switching is expensive, and wouldn't generate revenue before October at this point) - which means I am severely behind on shipping what orders I have generated, and none of my customers are particularly happy with me, so I can't use them for references.\n\nAm I just completely fucked at this point?  The thought of accepting a <$30k/yr job is incredibly depressing, though I realize that some income would be better than no income - and even if I did apply for those, I'm not confident that I would even be able to get them!\n\nMy knowledge and experience should qualify me for pretty good jobs (probably $55-65k/yr), but I have no idea how to sell myself to companies.  My resume says I've been self-employed since 2010 (because that's when I started working on my business plan).  I really don't know what to do at this point.\nTL;DR:"}

She asked if I had an eating disorder. (I don't, I'm a very tall and naturally lanky guy.) She went on to tell me that my hips hurt her when I'm on top of her. Naturally, this drove a pretty huge stake into my self confidence, and I'm having trouble taking my shirt off in front of her without feeling self conscience now. \n\nA couple nights ago she decided to smoke pot for the first time in a year, took 4 bong hits and absolutely lost it. She started getting lovey-dovey with everyone, and started blowing kisses and holding hands with a dude she has called \"good looking and charming\" in the past. This naturally made my stomach turn inside out because I consider it intimate behavior and definitely cheating had she been sober. To be fair she didn't specifically target just that person that night. She held hands with other people, and claims it was due to the state of mind of being on pot. She also decided to take her shirt off in a room full of people, several of which were males, and put on something more comfortable. She claims to have no memory of these things, and says it was 100% the weed, promising never to do it again, though several stoners have told me that such behavior isn't excusable on weed. \n\nI just don't know what to do here.

I had 5 other girlfriends in the past, but none of those lasted for even a month. We both always had insecurities about one of us talking to someone else of the opposite sex. She'd always been aware of me still being friends with a former crush, finally confronted me about it, but we settled it in the end.

That's right. I broke that promise. I don't know why. I wasn't thinking properly. It was on twitter and I replied to a girl because she posted a picture of a biscuit I liked (sorry if it sounds ridiculous to you, it does to me too). She kept talking to me and I just wanted to stop, but I couldn't, because I didn't want to seem rude.

I have been in a relationship before, but we started out as friends and then just became bf/gf. We never went on \"get to know each other\" dates. We were together for 3 years and I ended it last December because he was abusive and did not support my decision to move back home and help take care of my mom who has cancer. He was my first everything(boyfriend, kiss, sex, etc.)\n\nFast forward to now. I met this guy about a month ago and I immediately thought he was adorable and wanted to get to know him. I'm introverted and shy so it was very hard for me to make conversation. I would get so nervous. So after getting more courage, and making tiny conversation, he asks me out on a date. I said yes and we planned a time and day.\n\nI was a mess the whole day, pacing, trying to figure out what to wear, worrying that I'd mess it up somehow. But it all turned out well :) It was very nice and I didn't feel pressured at all and we just talked. We decided that we should go on a second date.\n\nI feel so silly getting worked up about this. I just have no idea whats expected on dates and what I'm supposed to ask or do. Like, my friends told me I was supposed to hug him after the first date, but I didn't cause I didn't know how or if I should or anything. \n\nSo second date is tomorrow. I'm excited, but I'm also anxious. I don't mess this up. I really like him and want to keep seeing him. \n\nAre there specific rules for dating? Or do I just go with what feels right? What are things I should or should not talk about? And what are some ways to calm the nerves? How much eye contact is necessary? Should I be texting him throughout the day?\nTL;DR:"}

I thought it was another cook and jokingly said \"don't touch my butt\". The one that actually did it confessed and before thinking, I immediately replied with \"oh it's okay then\" in a serious tone. He gave me a dirty look and the other cook asked if I was gay. My friend on the cash register overheard it and decided it'd be funny to play along and say \"has he not told you guys yet??\" Well the manager (who actually is gay and is only a few years older than me) overheard THAT and starts talking to me about how he has a single friend that's been lonely.

It was unreciprocated love; she never gave him the time of day romantically. He still sees her on a semi regular basis due to the fact that the have a class together a few days a week (a class that she coincidentally transferred into according to him.) He admits he still has \"very slight\" feelings for her, despite being in love with me and in an exclusive relationship with me. Every now and then a mutual friend in the class will post pictures and in some of them he's very close to \"that girl\" physically, which I find unsettling. \n\n**The issue:** Two months ago, a month before we officially started dating, he said he was going out with a group of people to a river for his male friends' birthday party. I found out last night by chance through one of his friends' instagram accounts that it was, in fact, \"that girl's\" birthday and he lied about it.  \n\nAdditionally, 2 weeks before we started officially dating, he said he was going school clothes shopping with a male and female friend of his, which was true. What he DIDN'T tell me, was that \"that girl\" was also there, which I also found out from that same instagram account. Not to mention he totally disappeared for HOURS that day out of nowhere.  \n\nKeep in mind that although we weren't dating exclusively at the time, we were already heading there and were totally invested in each other romantically already.  \n\n**My problem:** I don't know if I can trust what he says regarding this girl anymore, in regards to the severity of his feelings for her, how often they really see each other, and how close they are anymore.

We click on so many levels, she's very easy-going and fun to be around. \n\nWe used to have sex at least once a day. A few months into our relationship, we agreed to ditch the condoms and she tried birth control.

We have sex anywhere from one-three times per week and I've honestly been fine with, though it's on the low end for me. But the last two weeks, things have ground to a halt.\n\nI tried to bring up the seemingly glaring disparity in our libidos once, but didn't pursue it as she started to shut down. I've since given up on trying to initiate anymore, partially because I'm curious to see if she will, but also to avoid the inevitable awkward embarrassment that follows rejection. Am I less attractive to her? Too forward? Psyching her out? Is something bothering her? Am I not treating her right? \n\nIt feels like she just doesn't even consider anything I'm feeling as explained here, that she is simply unaware, but she can't be... right? Every day that passes without any sexual contact is another blow to my self-esteem, easily sending me into a spiraling hopelessness that I should fight to save (this part of) our relationship. It's lined up with a short series of disagreements we've had, and I guess I'm starting to question things. She's really great, I know she loves me a lot and could be devastated if I ended things, but I've had to now consider how important sex is for me in a relationship.\n\nPart of this post is maybe just needing a big ol' hug from the r/relationships community before I have the talk that I know we need, but I'd also appreciate some insight, particularly from what her perspective could be, before I go into it.

They dated for a few months before deciding to move in together (complicated but it made sense). They've been living together for about 6 months now. Today I saw on Facebook that he made a post asking if anyone knows of a 1 bedroom apartment for sale in the area because he is looking for one.\n\nObviously, I'm not sure what to do, if anything. I think it's pretty clear this means something is wrong with their relationship (he's complained about tension the past couple months, but he never made it seem really serious), but I don't think it's really my place to ask directly. I was thinking of inviting him out to a local bar we hang out at with another friend of ours, but I don't know if that is making it too obvious. Maybe I should just do nothing unless he brings it up. I'm closer to him then her, but I'm not really on either \"side.\"\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [18 M] with my long-time crush [19 F] started dating, but there are no sparks\nPOST: So I've had a crush on a girl for almost 3 years. I was overwhelmed by the feeling, that I was a really nervous kid, it took me almost 3 years to ask her out. We both have never dated before, and she was completely clueless that I liked her for the three years. Because of going to University, I did not see her for the past year and my feelings for her have been starting to fizzle away during that time, believing it was hopeless. However, after a turn of events, I recently asked her out and to my surprised, she says yes. We had a fun first date and even though, there was some chemistry, few breaks in the conversation, but there wasn't much spark. I felt very happy with the first date, and the second date was okay. Maybe it's because I was putting too much pressure for myself to decide on the best place for each date and pressure on making her happy. Maybe it's because of inexperience, but hugging her felt a bit forced and awkward to me. She probably felt it was awkward too, since our goodnight hug on our second date lasted 2 seconds.  I feel we have chemistry as friends, but I'm not sure if we should be dating. This is our first time ever dating anyone. I can't decide whether someone should be a friend or a potential partner.\nTL;DR:"}

I heard whispering but couldn't make out what was said. There was breathing at the end of my bed for about a minute. Then the door was closed out a bit but not fully and stepbrother went downstairs and came up a minute later whispering more to his brother but again I couldn't make out what was said. \n\nThe door opens out again and I hear more breathing at the end of my bed. Then they go off into their room where I hear more whispering and one goes out to the bathroom and I hear the light at the top of the stairs turn on (distinctive sound) and then off. Both boys are in bed now and I'm here with my door mostly shut but the light is still on too.\n\nAlso I think they didn't know I was here that's maybe why they came in to turn on the light because one of them is afraid of the dark and can't sleep without a light. I'm telling my mother in the morning but she usually gets up at like 6 so she might see my door open and light on which I NEVER do even if it's just me and her in the house. What should I do? I'm just freaked out. I'm overreacting I know but still.\n\nDo I turn off the lights and close the door and barricade it cause I was considering that or do I just keep everything as it is and just forget about it?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: How likely is it that my gym will report me to a credit/collections agency for not paying my membership fees?\nPOST: I enrolled in a new gym in Feb. 2010. The initial sign-up fee and monthly fees were fairly high (to its credit, it is a nice, newly-renovated facility) and in signing the initial contract, there was a clause that said one's membership could only be terminated by giving the gym three months of notice (while being charged regular monthly fees those three months). The membership fee was auto-billed to my primary credit card.\n\nI had not gone in about a month and had been considering terminating my membership when my bank called me in November 2010 telling me that my credit card and number had to be changed due to a \"mass credit card number compromise\" and I was being sent a new card. Forgetting my gym auto-billed me, I failed to realize this would be a problem until I received a notice from the gym saying I owed them my December fee in addition to a $35 USD fee for not being able to process my credit card.\n \nI was slightly enraged by this but thought this might be a good chance to get out of the membership. I ignored the letter and several phone calls I received from the gym, and ignored a similar \"past due fee\" letter I received earlier this month.\n\nTelling a friend about the situation, they informed me that the gym may decide to report me to a credit/collections agency after a certain period of time and it may be better to simply pay the overdue fee, terminate my membership now and begrudgingly accept the three months of fees.\n\nI have no desire to use this gym again and it has been months since I've used their services. I want out but don't want a hit on my credit. If I continue to not pay, what's the chance I will be reported?\n\n\\\nTL;DR:"}

Not rock climbing or deserted type of thing)\n* Biking around in a leisure fashion. Not having to worry too much about traffic/cars/trucks\n* Bathing in pool or lakes/oceans.\n* Visiting the city sights but I have had too much of Churches etc. Just enjoying a walk in the busy streets etc is good enough. Enjoying some beer in hostel with a young crowd would be nice as well. (I am a 27yo female myself)\n\n(Mostly moderate activities. No crazy mountain biking or climbing over 2 days etc. Recovering from a knee injury)\n\nFor now I am thinking Interlaken/Slovenia are close to what I have in mind.

I know young love is for suckers, BUT she gives some pretty nice head. So, fuck it, I'll stick around so she can slob on my knob. \nFrontstory - \nI was attending a basketball game for our local high school team, and I usually sit behind my girlfriend, who I will affectionately name Barb for the purpose of this post. Barb is a short, brown haired, thin girl wearing our school colors and jeans, so pretty much like half of the girls in our student section. So we're just chilling at this game, and I'm sitting by a bunch of people I don't really know, but attend our school. \nAnyway, Barb decides to go to the concessions stand outside of the gym. Me being my alert and attentive self made nothing of it and forgot probably immediately after she told me. So I just sit here on my phone and kind of lose track of things. Later, I shuffled over to a girl who I thought was Barb and playfully grabbed her pant muffins. To my surprise a girl I have never talked to before turned around in great anguish, with a look on her face like I just killed and raped her dog or something. I felt awful and was super embarrassed. Barb heard about this and hasn't stopped giving me shit for it.\nTL;DR:"}

Not complaining as I know full time parents who work full time and go to school. Anyways, so I go to school from 8-2, work 3-11, and I needed to study for a mid-term afterwards and didn't get to bed till 5 am (three hours asleep and I'm not really a morning person on a normal sleep schedule). It's also important to note I have a low tolerance to substances (alcohol, Motrin, and even caffeine).   \n\nThe FU: I get to school and complain how tired I am to a friend of mine, lets call him Timothy. Timothy tells me about these amazing chocolates that he has which really wakes him up. He pulls out a bag of them from his backpack and gives me one. \"These are really good\" I think and have a few more. A few minutes pass and I start to feel more alert which was good. I was definitely ready for class now!....That's when everything went downhill. First, I became really jittery in class. Completely incapable to sit still. Than I start talking a lot (I'm a real quiet person unless I'm with my inner circle of friends), suddenly I need to just move fast. This happened till about 11am when I hit the wall... The crash hit hard and fast. I just passed out and hit the ground. Woke up in the University Hospital 20 minutes ago with a broken nose, black eye and one long lecture about having too much psychoactive drugs (fancy word for coffee I think). I also happened to take my car to school today and parked at a meter long over due, so I have to talk to parking services to get the boot off my wheel and pay my ticket.\nTL;DR:"}

My roommate is alright; we send each other an occasional text every now and then, but we're not buddy-buddy.\n\nThe reason why I'm asking is because I'm (obviously) gay, but not flamboyant. I'm masculine to a point, but sometimes when I get really comfortable around someone, I'll just... not act like a flamer, but I'll let something slip, like, \"Oh, he's cute!\" Because I'll forget that some people don't like it, etc.\n\nAll of the guys I'm friends with are completely, totally, irrevocably straight. They playfully call each other \"fags\" and \"homos,\" and I sit there awkwardly. But it's a guy thing. I don't care or get offended by that.\n\nI lied to my roommate and told him I was bi (to sorta cushion the blow), and he was kinda like, \"I don't care. I mean, yeah, it's awkward, but I really don't care. It's college, so don't worry about it.\" That was nice to hear.\n\nI'm not out, either. No one knows, and no one ever suspects, until I decline interaction with a female. The guys will always be like, \"We need to go out and get some pussy.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, but.... I can't. Work. Studying. Stuff.\" And they'll brush it off, but sometimes they'll tease, \"You never hang with the guys. People will think you're gay.\" Things like that make me afraid to be even remotely flamboyant or \"gay\" in the least.\n\nNOTE: I am not attracted to any of these guys, I just want friendships. It would be the same way with a girl and a guy being friends; people say it can't happen, but I'm pretty sure I see it all the time.\nTL;DR:"}

We were doing okay, and I'll admit, we were going through a rough patch, mainly bc it was a pseudo LDR, we lived an hour away from each other. The big issue was that we were both in Uni at different schools and work got in the way. I was only able to see her during the weekends and her parents did not allow her to come see me. She would sneak out though, even when we were caught doing this twice. We had talked about moving in and were in the process of getting our own place, but the dad wanted us married first, so I asked for her hand in marriage at that moment. She started becoming indifferent from that moment on. \n\nWhat is helping me, I guess, is that physically, we did not spend much time together, we mainly texted/talked everyday, providing support for each other in which ever way we could. But she started telling me that she wanted more. She enjoyed the emotional aspect of our relationship but she required more physical attention. Sexually, we were a perfect pair. But even that part wasnt enough for her anymore. We did the whole phone sex thing for years, never once did it get boring. \n\nI do miss her, and I wish I could talk to her because I feel like we were mainly friends with benefits. I do truly love her with all my heart and wish the best for her. I always told her that her happiness was my main priority and I wasn't making her happy anymore. So I let her dump me. \n\nI made so many memories with her, and I do honestly hope that we can remain friends so we can see each other achievements and who knows, maybe we can try again after we both are done with school.\nTL;DR:"}

I always assumed he was just being young and would take his time and not rush into a huge committment. Wrong.  On his 1 year anniversary of dating, he gave his GF a ring.  I think he may have felt pressure from her to give a ring so soon, but that's just my opinion.  \n\nHe is the type to get extremely involved in relationships, to the point where I barely see him when he is dating someone.  He did not tell me his plan to propose until the night before he did it.  I could only react with surprise/shock.  I didn't tell him not to do it, but in my head I was calling him an idiot.  The relationship is still so new and he is still young.  I did express this to him but also tried to support him as he would do what he wanted to do with or without my support.  I did not want to offend him or cause him to not feel close to me, but I feel that I can't hide how I feel, especially if they go through with a wedding.  \n\nHer brothers, who are younger than she is, are in the military and are married.  I am aware that there is a trend for military service members to get married younger, and I am wondering if my brother's GF feels pressure to get married soon as she is the oldest but still single while her younger brothers are already married.  \n\nDo him & his GF just have vastly different views on marriage than I do?

Lately, her comments and actions have really been getting under my skin.\n\nFor instance, I like a guy who isn't interested in me romantically. Sucks, but I can handle that. My friend will make comments such as \"What if he met me and started to like me?\" and \"He probably has a girl over right now.\". It makes me feel like shit. She is easily offended, so if I talk about how I don't approve of those comments she will go into a rage mode. When I hang out with other friends she will ask me where I was/who I was with/when/what did we talk about. I've caught her looking at my mail (personal cards, tax form, etc.) I will listen to her vent, but she acts annoyed if I would like to talk about an issue of my own for once.\n\n She has extreme anger issues that she is aware of. She is going through a lot (shitty on/off relationship & family issues that are somewhat self-inflicted) and admits she is insecure, but not seeking professional help. I can't help her and she doesn't seem to want to change. I feel guilty for not wanting to be her friend during this time, but the negativity is wearing me out. \n\nHow do I go about breaking off the friendship? Honestly, I sort of fear for my safety.

He always talked about how much he hated her and it seemed like he was annoyed at her call, so blocking was the answer in my head.  J proceeded to become very defensive and unwilling to block her number.  He said his app (trap call) wouldn't allow it to be blocked.  I looked into what trap call was and it definitely allowed numbers to blocked. \n\nI brought up this point to J and he completely changed his answer. He said he didn't block her number so she would see that she was calling but he still wouldn't pick up.  We proceeded to get into a huge fight with him ending up blocking her number.\n\nFast forward to this week.  I saw he deleted E's number but he also unblocked her number.  What would be the point of this? She called again tonight and we ended up in another fight.\nTL;DR:"}

She recently went on vacation for a couple of months, and has thus far been gone for a month. We've been in contact, but only minimally. While at first I missed her, as time went on I noticed that my life is more or less completely unchanged despite the fact that she's not around. I honestly can't remember what it is that I feel like I need her in my life for. I've always thought that our relationship was great and amazing in every way, but now I can't really think of why.\n\nWe were planning to get married, but if a month apart is all it takes for me to question this kind of shit, I feel like I might be making a huge mistake. Can anyone relate? Are these feelings normal? Has anyone been in this situation and how have you dealt with these feelings? Am I being paranoid?\nTL;DR:"}

This isnt your typical relationship question, as Im not in a relationship. However, I do have some questions about the possibility of one.\n\nI frequent my local gym everyday. And nearly everyday, Ill see this guy. We would work out in the same private room, on opposite sides, and slowly started speaking. Now, we flirt, we workout every other day together. Hes sweet, hes very very nice, and hes good looking to boot. Hes in great physical shape, hes very driven, hes almost done school, and hes got a great career on the way. \n\nIn short, hes driven, hes smart, hes (very) attractive and active, and has shown many of the qualities that I would like in my partner.\n\nHowever, I always knew his rest day was Tuesday. Today, during our post workout chit chat, I found out its because he and his friend (who also worksout with us) are Jehovas Witnesses, and Tuesday is communion. This took me a back a little, as it was kind of... the last thing I ever expected. \n\nIm really interested in this guy. However, Im not religious. At all. I just dont beleive in anything, and hat won be changing. Ever. I dont go to church. I drink, not often, but whn I go out once in a while I will drink, and often get drunk. I am not a virgin, and beleive in sex before marriage. I need to know my partner and I are on the same page, and are compatible. I swear. Is it okay to swear in front of him??? Can I say \"Oh god\"??? \n\nEssentially, is there any chance of this looking good? Or do I have to be a church going goody two shoes to have a chance?\nTL;DR:"}

So I stopped by the one my friends wanted to check out and tried to cram in a couple hours of partying into like half an hour. Drank three cups of veeery strong jungle juice, felt sick, puked, felt better, decided to keep partying.\n\nParty number two, we play a drinking game where the loser takes a shot. I lost five times in a row (in maybe fifteen minutes) and, needless to say, was shitfaced, so when a friend suggested we put on togas, I was all for it. I snagged a sheet from him and tied it on, when he commented that my bra ruined the effect and I should take it off. Drunk as I was, I agreed.\n\nThe next couple hours are lost to me. Apparently I was completely coherent the whole time, other than a couple flashing incidents, and went all over campus visiting people. Finally, around 2 AM, a friend found me passed out on the quad, toga askew, near a group of people. He carried me home, where I vom'd for the rest of the night.\nTL;DR:"}

I have been friends with this wonderful girl for the past 3-4 years. I am male, she is female. We are both in our early 20's. While in college, we were as close as could be. We hung out everyday, would study together, basically would do whatever as long as we were together. I met her and got to know her basically when my friend at the time started dating her. \n\nWhen she broke up with him, I started asking her to hang out. While we were getting closer, she was always going after other men. I was pretty awkward virgin at the time, had never had a GF, etc. Basically, had no confidence at all. One day during the summer, she asked me if I liked her. Like an idiot, I said no, that I saw her as my best friend. We were really close, and I even got along well with most of her family. I've regretted that moment ever since. Sometimes I stay awake, wondering how life would have been different if I had said yes. \n\nThis was several years ago. We stayed close, and we are now in our own relationships. She has been dating a guy for the past 2 years, in a long distance relationship. I have also been dating a guy for the past year, and it has been an awesome experience. We also don't live close to each other, as we now live in different states. She is soon going to be living in the same place as her boyfriend, and has basically made life plans with him, though she claims constantly that she is not a believer in life long relationships, etc. \n\nI guess I have 2 questions. The first one is if a girl gets really close to a guy, does it always mean that she likes him? I never got the impression she liked me, since she was almost always going after other guys. Though my response to her question has bugged me for years. I feel like I want to marry this girl, and blew my chance at that. The Second question is, should I mention it to her at all? We still talk constantly, but I don't see the point in discussing this with her.\nTL;DR:"}

While I have a lot of free time (only a few hours of work most days if I don't waste all day on reddit to keep it going), I still can't drop everything and leave to go on vacation or something.

Often, he doesn't even take the time to pleasure me after he's finished. I don't think he's truly tried to make me finish in about 1.5-2 years. It hurts to feel like your pleasure doesn't matter.

He told her about me being pregnant, and she automatically started yelling stuff like \"she did this on purpose\" and \"She is just after your money\" and \"why are you even with her, its clear that she had this baby to keep you around and to support her.\"\n\nHe tried to tell her off, standing up for me, saying that he wants this baby, I am not like that, etc.\n\nI just don't know what to do. This made me upset that she thought that about me, but glad he stood up for me. I don't want this to affect their relationship, but don't know what to do.\n\nIs there any way of convincing her she is wrong? She has never met me, and lives 200 miles away. They rarely see each other, but talk on the phone a lot.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: How can I get him to understand my perspective on sex (without putting my foot in my mouth any further)? [Long, sorry!] [21f/19m]\nPOST: So a little bit of back story... I've been with my boyfriend for three months (though we've technically been dating for three weeks). He was my childhood best friend, we drifted apart, found each other again, and basically picked up where we started... but with a twist. We're an excellent couple-- extremely compatible in just about every way possible-- and our relationship is incredibly comfortable. It came as no surprise, then, when we finally sealed the deal two days ago. The sex is phenomenal. \n\nThere's just one problem... Well, it's stupid to say that it's a problem because realistically, it's fantastic that he's so obsessed with my own satisfaction, but still. We'll have a fair amount of foreplay, fantastic sex, and then the second he finishes, he instantly tries to get me off (and succeeds, but that's not my point). He refuses to believe that I actually enjoy sex without having to finish. I tried explaining to him that there is nothing I enjoy more than that deep physical connection but he seems to think that I'm lying to him to make him feel better. Every aspect of our sex is amazing beyond words-- the emotional connection, the physical, sexual, spiritual, mental, etc-- but he just doesn't believe that I'm telling the truth. He can't wrap his head around the thought of enjoying sex without having an orgasm. \n\nTo make matters worse, last night when I tried to reassure him that I was completely satisfied and that all I really wanted to do afterwards was cuddle (versus get off), I accidentally brought up my last partner. (I am his first, he's my second) Needless to say, that didn't go over well. I was just trying to reassure him that he's amazing, but he's apparently not a fan of being compared to other guys. Whoops.\n\nHow do I get him to understand that I am totally content with sex whether I finish or not? I want him to enjoy himself... not stress out the entire time...\nTL;DR:"}

I learned the basics in college and I thought the kids would have some fun fake hitting each other. Well, we go through punching, kicking, etc, and we get to more complicated stuff like pretending to hit a wall. \n\nI go to demonstrate this against the door frame of a closet. The trick is to hit your foot against the surface to make the sound while throwing your head forward toward the wall but not actually hitting it... except I wasn't paying attention to how close I was to the wall while I was explaining. I turn around quickly to throw my head forward and BAM- I actually smacked my forehead against it. The kids couldn't figure out at first whether I was just really good at faking it or if I actually hit myself. But they found out once I stood there dazed for a few seconds and started holding my head. Now I have a lump.\n\nI went to the doctor though just in case and I do not have a concussion, so that's good...\nTL;DR:"}

These days I actually really like cats, I find they're kinda awesome, especially the more loving, but less physically demanding ones.\n\nThing is, I still don't like the idea of actually HAVING a cat. The main reason I really dislike this idea is that cats climb on EVERYTHING, and claw things all the time.\n\nI especially find it disgusting the way cats are always climbing on benches (the kind you prepare food on) and tables ( the kind you eat food off of), and it seems like even if you stop them climbing on benches when you're around, they'll still do it when you're not.\n\nIs there a way of training a cat to stop this behaviour even when you're not around? Seriously. Everything else about a cat would be pretty sweet I think, but the prospect of cats jumping up and stickig their heads/paws/tongues/whatever in to food and drink I leave unoccupied is a total turn off to the idea.\n\nAlso, how do you stop a cat from clawing stuff? I know exactly what it will claw when it gets here and it's a really nice set of 1920s sofa and armchairs which I DO NOT want ruined.\n\nFor those wondering, I have basically no say in the matter, and am actually somewhat optimistic about it all, looking forward to my first cat, but these problems will drive me up the wall if I can't solve them and so in order for me to have a healthy relationship with my new pet, and to get joy from the companionship it can give me I'm asking you guys for help.\n\nThanks if you read this rant.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: MI: New construction concrete spalling. Contractor won't replace. Advice?\nPOST: I closed on my newly built home in June of 2013. Everything in the home was great until March 2014, when the snow from the Polar Vortex finally started to melt. I noticed the concrete was spalling and pitting EVERYWHERE - in my garage, driveway, sidewalks, and approach. I started complaining in March with weekly emails (with pictures), escalated to weekly phone calls, and finally, in July, the builder and concrete subcontractor came to look.  In September 2014, I received a letter in the mail stating that the concrete spalling was due to my use of de-icing chemicals and the terrible winter, and therefore not subject to the 1-year warranty. They suggested I seal the concrete and live with it.\n\nI contacted the Better Business Bureau, who basically served as an online middle-man because the builder and I simply wrote out our arguments without any resolution.  I also filed a complaint with my county's building inspector and the state's licensing board.\n\nI signed an arbitration agreement when I contracted with the builder. I'm 95% sure the $700 arbitration costs will be worth it, especially considering estimates for tear-up and replacement are around $7,000. But, can I win?\n\nI plan on taking photos of the houses done by the same builder around the time of my closing (+/- 6 weeks) to show that my concrete is the only damaged concrete out of all the homes (about 10) done around the same time.  Unfortunately, I can't get a cement contractor to write something stating the reason for the spalling (a bad mix/too much water).  What else would be useful to take to arbitration to help my case? Should I get a lawyer to help? I'm nervous that if I lose, I will be out the $7,000 replacement driveway PLUS attorney fees.\nTL;DR:"}

For the first 6 months or so, they were obsessed with each other and everything seemed fine. We have gone on numerous double dates and hung out together (the 4 of us) several times, so I've gotten to know her pretty well. She is the sweetest girl and incredibly gorgeous; I don't know why she stays with this ass clown. Somewhere along the way, they started having a lot of drama in their relationship and broke up for a little while. When he started hooking up with other girls, obviously, no one cared at first, until his (ex?) gf started posting things on FB about \"her man\" and having date nights with the guy who had supposedly broken up with her. Come to find out, he is still leading her on and letting her think they are in a relationship while he tells everyone else that he's single and is hooking up with a different girl every weekend (I have witnessed this myself on more than one occasion, and heard several stories from my bf and his friends). Even my bf and some of their mutual guy friends are upset at this guy for what he is doing to this sweet girl, but no one has had the balls to really do anything about it.\n\nMy question to all of you: Do I have the right to say anything either to him OR to her about this situation?

We'll call them Roommates A, B, and C for simplicity's sake. Roommate A and I got along fine, and we're living together this year. Unfortunately, we had conflicts with Roommates B and C.\n\nLong story short: I like things neat. I like a clean kitchen and living room space. At the beginning of the year, we made an agreement that we'd work together to keep the spaces clean and respect each other's right to have a clean living area. For example, we decided that we wouldn't leave dirty dishes in the sink overnight. However, Roommates B and C didn't respect this agreement. By the end of the year, our sink was too full with dirty dishes for me to wash even a cereal bowl. Our counters were too cluttered for me to use them for, you know, actually eating or preparing food. B and C took up far more than their share of the fridge space. I tried talking to them about it, but nothing ever changed.\n\nNow, I've moved into the new apartment early with Roommate A, and we're doing fine. No longer living with B and C.

I'm trying to be open and supportive, but I already feel myself getting defensive over the public spaces and how clean they are with just me and Roommate A living here. \n\nRoommates B and C hurt my trust in other people--if two of my best friends blatantly disregarded a simple living agreement and showed no intention of working to compromise, how can I trust D and E, whom I don't know anywhere near as well?

And funny enough the bomb 'explodes'. \n\nIt's important to say that the bomb was made out of cardboard and a kitchenwatch (see the picture below). \n\nWhen we filmed the last scenes at the wednesday we just went home because we were pretty tired. \n\nTwo days after (friday) one of my groupmembers tagged me and the rest of my group in a FB post to an article where the title was: \"Breaking! Bomb threat <my town>\" \n\nFirst we just laughed about it, because we thougt that it couldn't be ours... Until we realised that it maybe could be ours..\n\nWe decided to call the police, because this could turn out to some really bad shit... xD It was already on the frontpage of 7 of the biggest papers here in Denmark. \n\nThe groupmember that lived closest to the trainstation went up there to talk to the police and to remove the bomb. (She actually had to remove the bomb for them because they didn't dare to do it xD)\n\nAnd it made some great laughs in class the day after...\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Getting tired of my boyfriend's broke ass. Am I being spoiled or is this justified?\nPOST: My boyfriend is 20, like me. I'm a girl if that's relevant. We've only been together a couple months.\n\nLast year (2014-2015) he was away at college. He got back in the summer and for some reason didn't get a job, didn't even look for one. He had some savings and stuff to live off of. When not working, he smoked a lot of pot and slept. He didn't get a job until two weeks ago (basically he was jobless from May through January, not counting his time at college because I don't care if he didn't work at college.\n\nWhen we first got together two ish months ago, I tried to be really understanding and stuff, and knew he wouldn't have a lot of money to do stuff with. But after constantly paying for our dates, buying him food, buying him cigarettes, and spending a ton of gas money picking him up/getting him to work (he doesn't have a car, of course)(even though I spend a ton of money driving 2 hours to and from school every day). I'm really, really annoyed. As much as I don't care if a guy has money or not, I'd at least like him to be self sufficient.\n\nValentines day (and this is literally the first valentines day that I've been with someone, so I wanted it to be special) he kept promising me we'd go out and he'd pay. Come to find out that his paycheck is delayed for some reason, so as always, we get to sit on his bed and watch movies for the millionth time.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled. Maybe I'm asking too much. I don't know. He treats me well. I just don't understand his work ethic. Hes constantly in financial need and it stresses me out horribly. He's always been (the past two weeks) trying to find a ride to work, which is about twenty minutes away from him by car, or trying to get food, or trying to pay rent. It worries me so much, and I just don't understand why he didn't ever get a fucking job and spent all his money on weed for six months or whatever.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [25M] have been wanting to break up with my [24F] girlfriend of one year because I'm not fully being sexually satisfied by her and I feel bad for wanting to break up over something like that.\nPOST: So I am definitely more sexually experienced than my girlfriend, and when it comes to sex she is much more vanilla than I. It is not that we don't have enough sex, it is just that it is so boring and has zero excitement for me. It is always the same thing when we have sexy times. We go to the bedroom, she will go down on me for like 30 seconds, she then lays on her back and I go on top until I finish, then I go down on her until she finishes, not a lot of variance to that.\n\nI've expressed that I would like her to go down on my a little more evenly, and maybe try to get me off that way, she has always agreed to try but after a little over a minute she stops, saying that her jaw hurts and that it is taking to long for me. I've been too hesitant to express an interest in trying any other things in bed because so many times we will be watching TV and they will mention or talk about some sexual act that isn't vanilla and she contorts her face in disgust and says how gross and inappropriate that is. So I've never really asked to try anything more than having her go down on my longer because I'm worried that she will have the same response towards me and think I'm some freak.\n\nOther than that she is a good girlfriend, I know if we had more excitement in our sex life that I would be happier with her but it scares me thinking that this could be the state of my sex life for the rest of my life if I stay with her, and that makes me a sad panda. However I feel bad for wanting to break up with her just based on boring sex, I feel like maybe something is wrong with me and maybe I need to try to have less sexual desires.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know much past that, but I understand hard work. \n\nWhen my wife has one on one time with me, I can knock everything out.  I think I get so caught up in neglecting her that I tell her I'll do something, something that is needed.  Something I notice.  This is a task she can easily do, and if I do it, I'm such a hero.\n\nThat sounds perfect before I go to sleep.  The next morning is a different animal.  I wake up, instantly start working.  I can work for 15 hours + straight.\n\nI work for myself.  The more I bill, the more I make.  When I step away from work, everything is wonderful.  I can't even stop working to feed the dogs sometimes.  \n\nI hold my urine in for 10 hours at a time.  I will just sit at my desk and tell myself 20 more minutes, 1 more hour, just wait until you finish this.\n\nJust recently these are the examples.  \n\nI will change the sheets.  - Why would I say that?  because the sheets are so tight on the bed that they are giving me back issues.

She always does.  It is totally awesome.  I'm guessing that is worth an extra $100/month for us to have the money, instead of paying someone.  I don't know.  I didn't do it, that would cause me to be too far away from the computer.  And I'm not able to bill someone for that time..\nTL;DR:"}

He told me he wants to break up because while we are apart I get into bad moods and take it out on him by being distant and maybe a little mean (when I asked how I was mean he didn't have examples). I know that was terrible of me and I have no excuse, but I had no idea I was even hurting him, I just thought I was acting distant. He never once tried to tell him that what I said hurt him, if I had known I would have made a major adjustment and apologized profusely. \n\nWe've had communication problems in the past, mainly on his side. I've made an effort to be open and discuss my problems, but he never wants to discuss his because he's afraid we'll fight. I thought that was normal, and I wouldn't even call it fighting, we'd just argue.\n\nBecause he was mad at me for acting this way he did nothing for valentines day which I thought was pretty immature, and then broke up with me the next day. \n\nI asked him to give me a chance to make it up to him and change, which I thought would be sufficient since he said that this is the only reason he doesn't want to be with me, but he isn't sure if he wants to stay with me because now he's not in love with me.\n\nWe talked the day after he broke it off and he decided he wants to see if it's the distance that is making him feel this way.

I was really excited to go until I learned of the following.  This group includes his sister and her children (8F, 5M). I haven't met his sister but I knew that the 5 year old has a peanut allergy which causes hives. Because of this the child is home-schooled and not fully vaccinated. \n\nI'm a biologist and firmly believe in vaccines as does my boyfriend, and he says the sister is just worried about her son. Fine, that's her choice. That's not the issue at hand today though - his sister is freaking out because I'm not from a peanut-free household.\n\nI got a text screen shot from him (sent by his sister.) The gist is this - for me to interact with them, I need to have been nut free for 48 hours (thought it was just peanuts initially, apparently it's tree nuts too, and I totally had walnuts this morning because they're yummy) and have to shower before coming over.  Plus I need to change my clothes before I come over into clothes of mine that have been recently washed.  She wanted me to do laundry at my bfs house as she couldn't guarantee that the washer my home is nut free?! \n\nThis is, in my opinion, over the top.

We were together before the job, we live together, we have a baby together as well as my 3.5 and 5 year olds from a previous relationship. We're monitored minimally at best. We've had a long struggle with him always wanting to look at porn (not even real porn, just pictures of other girls, selfies and whatnot), but I recently found out that for at least a week (could be and probably is longer) he's taken to picking up a public wifi signal on his phone that doesn't have service so that he can look at this stuff at his desk. Not sure if he's actually making a trip to the bathroom to finish but he used to pleasure himself at work in the bathroom before his service was turned off anyway. I absolutely can't stand it. It feels stomach-turning to think that he's so desperate to look at porn without the possibility of me noticing that he's sneaking it at his desk and lying. Am I completely in the wrong for having an issue with this as he's suggested, for either the porn at work, the lying, or both? I honestly don't know what to feel anymore, it's bothered me and hurt me for all of the common reasons for so long that I'm almost numb to it. I don't usually have an issue with the concept of porn, jerkin' it, etc., but the way he goes about keeping it his deepest, darkest secret, lying to my face about it, doing it at desks, parking lots at fast food places with free wifi, for some reason this element just gives me anxiety attacks. Also, yes, I'm aware I should get counseling - actively seeking.\nTL;DR:"}

Initially I setup an excel spreadsheet with expenses for utilities and grocery store expenses. \n\nShe would constantly complain about having to pay at the end of the month. She'd nitpick at me and say that I would overcharge her or she shouldn't have to pay as much, but wouldn't talk about how much she believes she wants to pay.\n\nShe's currently in graduate school and complains non stop about how she has no income (I consider student loan money income that should be budgeted just like everything else). She says that because I have a job, money isn't an issue for me and to stop telling her she has to pay her share. But I don't see her ever sacrifice anything. She doesn't try to cut back on her social outings. She doesn't say she can't afford a trip with me -- she just comes along and then sees the bill at the end and tries to make me feel sorry for her and just cover all the expenses.\n\nI'm having a hard time dealing with this. If she doesn't want to pay for things she needs to be upfront about it. She needs to make sacrifices if she cannot afford things, not just see the bill and then complain to me.\n\nShe is practically financially illiterate. I try and help her but she says she doesn't want to be treated like a child -- yet she won't do any research on her own. I really don't think she wants to learn to deal with this ever. I try and tell her this is part of being an independent adult.\n\nLastly, she came from a family that provided her with lots of things. Her undergrad was paid for and she still gets lots of perks from her family. I, on the other hand, grew up in poverty and have been supporting myself since I was 18.\n\nCan this problem be solved? Every financial discussion turns into a fight and is completely unproductive. I'm super frustrated. Is this relationship doomed?\nTL;DR:"}

I believe that if I go to school online I have a better chance of succeeding in life. I think it would hinder my social life for the next two years though. I am depressed during the school year because I am stressed all the time. I have been suspended in school about 30 days because I get angry at the teachers lack of teaching ability. I don't really want to go back there. We are also facing losing accreditation soon. I want to go to a college that is good.

(20f & 23m)\nPOST: I found out I was pregnant last Thursday and I've been so scared and panicking. I told the father, who is this guy I've been casually seeing for almost 5 months now, and I didn't expect him to be excited but he has been so unbelievably mean and unhelpful. I just don't know what to do. \n\nHe has always been really nice to me, and he is smart and I really like him. He is Med School and is a decent guy. He told me he didn't want anything serious, but he has been really sweet to me up until now. \n\nI'm on birth control, but not as perfect as I should be. Its my fault and I know that. \n\nSo, I called the father, Rahul, and he told me he couldn't handle anything right now and that I need to sort this out on my own. First thing he said. I told him I didn't want him to do anything for me, but just be there. This is our baby. \n\nHe freaked out on me and just went on a rant. About how its not his child, and how we were casual and he knows I was sleeping around, so I need to deal with *my* child on my own. It was the last thing I wanted to hear, feeling shitty already and it broke me. He continued to just be an asshole, by calling me a slut in texts and said he would never have anything to do with it, and I needed to have an abortion. \n\nThere hasn't been anyone else since before Christmas, and Rahul came in me. This is his baby. I know I'm not ready to be a mom, but I don't know if abortion is for me. I'm leaning towards abortion, but I can't handle him tormenting me or hating me and I don't want people to judge. I just don't know what to do. I'm like hoping he texts me back saying he wants to be there, but he won't say anything, or if he does its so mean.\nTL;DR:"}

Now what??\nPOST: This is kind of a followup from an earlier question that has the background story: \n\nMy boyfriend went to talk to her maturely today, hoping that she would be a little bit considerate and explain her hatred towards him. But alas, it did not work. He ended up calling her a passive-aggressive cunt (which I will admit was not the best thing to do on his part). She stormed out, talked to our RA, and called the cops.\n\nI don't know what the fuck she told them, but now he is in jail for \"assaulting\" her when he really did nothing. I was right there and I saw all that went down. I guess my question is, what do I do when it's basically just her lies against our truth? The cops said she was \"very worked up\" so it seems like she's playing victim and getting everyone's sympathy and making him look like the bad guy.\nTL;DR:"}

The split between her and my friend was pretty nasty, and she knows I'm friends with him now (I kind of cut him off at the same time I was hanging out with her.)

After talking for a while, we ended up making out until she had to leave. Drunkenly friended her (and other people I met there) on facebook after leaving the party, but haven't contacted her otherwise so far. \n\nShe seemed really into me, but we had both been drinking, so who knows. Also, it would be understandable that she may have just wanted to have fun then and there, and I totally realize that a kiss doesn't necessarily mean anything beyond that. If that's the case, then it might just be awkward and presumptuous to ask her out or anything.\n\nTo complicate things, her relationship status on FB says she's in a long term relationship. But her friends didn't seem phased at all that we were making out, and there isn't actually any other sign of her having a boyfriend on FB. Everything aside from her relationship status on FB makes it look like she actually got out of a long term relationship a few months ago.\n\nI want to see her again. If she's not single, I (of course) wouldn't pursue her. But aside from that, I'm also just uncertain whether she's actually into me in more than a drunk party fun way.\n\nAnyway.

I think I'm a decent person but breaking the ice is hard for me. I was determined to do something about it and I saw all the popular girls had something in common. They all dressed a certain way (trendy, revealing clothes) and acted a certain way (flirty, sexual). \n\nUp to recently I had never done more sexually than a few kisses. I didn't really have any hangups about anything, it just never happened. And my clothes were all really boring and big and not flattering. \n\nSo I spent a bunch of money on new clothes and started acting all flirty like other girls do and everything seemed to change. People treated me better, talked to me, everything turned around almost instantly. I got invited to parties and guys started paying lots of attention to me. Everything is great but it just took off a little fast. In the last few months, I've gone from total virgin to sex with 3 guys, plus some blowjobs and some more minor stuff (texted some sexy clothed pics, kissed some girls at a party, some handjobs, and some making out)\n\nIt's been a lot of fun and I'm staying safe and life is great at school now, but my mother is getting really worried about me. She sees how I dress and she knows about at least one time I had sex (she found the condom in my room. oops.) and knows Im spending more time with guys. She wants me to stop and not have sex till I'm 18 but honestly, that's never going to happen. She says I'm going to ruin my life and catch every disease and never learn how to love anyone but I think that's all crazy. Personally I dont see any reason to stop now.

It doesn't matter to me if you think that God created us, or if we are space farts; fact of the matter is that we are all different for some reason or another. People will believe what they want to believe or not believe. The ones who accept everyone to this degree and see that we all can use values from some source or religion/non-religion are the outstanding people. However, the longer I lurk and browse Reddit, the more I see that the atheism subreddit demands the most attention. They follow one another's' beliefs as if they were following a religion, and though they do not have a leader or supreme being, they do enjoy posting links that breed the same hate and intolerance as other religions do. I would like to think that some people are different and that perhaps a subreddit that would speak of indifference towards others would exist somewhere; and some people would motion for that change of universal tolerance of everyone and everything; however I now see that /r/atheism is just another religion. I'm sorry to those who cannot speak their mind in any religious or nonreligious threads for fear of losing karma or getting down voted and that as much as the followers of /r/atheism try to say they are not a hivemind and that they speak out as individuals, collectively they are a group.

She took virtually everything except a small house in Virginia and split it between my dad and his brother.\n\nFast forward all these years, my parents still live in Virginia in the same house basically just living within their means. \n\nAnyway, so the crazy stuff is now:\n\nMy mom calls me and tells me she figured out at the gravesite today that my Dad's father had married his niece, Betty. So my father's cousin was his new stepmom all those years. Fucking batshit.\n\nHowever, she shouldn't have been given everything with her marriage being illegal and void, right?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Where Do I Live?\nPOST: Okay so for the information, I'm 18 and currently live with my mum, mum and dad been separated for 5 years now and are still on good terms (still friends). As of late I have decided that university was not for me even though I got good grades all throughout high school and so on, I just was not enjoying university. Ever since then my mum has been a total BITCH. She is clearly unsupportive of my decision and claims it wasn't mine to make (whereas Dad said that he'd support any decision I made and it was up to me). Every little minor thing I do wrong now she blows up about, she normally has a temper but it only comes out if I mess up pretty big (I'm a shy, quiet, good kid so nothing major).\nAt the moment I can't stand living here and seriously am considering moving in with Dad. However my dilemma is that mum has mentioned before that all she has left to live for is us kids (me and sister who is 14) she doesn't know what she'd do without us. Also the way my mum is I'd lose a lot of the stuff I own although not super important I'd lose ps3, PC, TV, My car and basically anything else she can claim she paid for (the items themselves don't matter it's the monetary value of them).\nSo what do I do, Do I stay living with mum and be unhappy or risk destroying my mum and ruining in family relationships to live with dad?\n-NOTE - I did see a counsellor with this matter probably 6-8 months ago.\nTL;DR:"}

We never talked about our exes - I just know he has an ex who he dated since high school on and off, and he knows I had one guy from a few years back, but we've never said anything more about it. I haven't told him about my problems growing up or in college, or anything super personal really. We enjoy each others' company and spend a lot of time together, but I'm starting to feel like maybe our relationship is too shallow considering that we've been together for 8+ months. \n\nI feel like he barely knows me because we haven't talked about our pasts, so I was wondering. Like for example, if you dealt with past issues, i.e. you used to be a kleptomaniac. Or had an eating disorder. Or you were a semi alcoholic. Or suffered from sexual assault. Say you got over something crazy that really bothered you at one point in your life, and now everything is fine, you got therapy, you got over it. How important is it for a long term bf/gf to know these things about you, if it's super personal and makes you super vulnerable, but it should no longer be an issue in your current relationship?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [F20] boyfriend [M21] is possessive, but not when I need it.\nPOST: My boyfriend of 1.5 years is possessive, but not at the right times. It seems that he swings between two extremes.\n\nFor example, when we go to a party together or simply call in on one of his friends, he insists I wear an item of his clothing. It always falls under the guise of ensuring I'm warm, and he wouldn't admit it was a statement of possession. **But,** he let slip after drinking too much at a party that he liked \"letting people know [I'm his].\"\n\nAn example of the opposite behaviour is when we go out. Now I don't insist that he sticks by my side the entire time, but when I'm feeling genuinely uncomfortable due to a guy being overly flirtatious, said boyfriend shows no interest. If I call him on it or request his help, he simply states \"I'm not worried, it's not like they have a chance anyway.\" I know this is meant as a compliment but I don't feel *noticed* enough.\n\nI know he cares for me deeply, but I'd like to feel possessed when I need protection, not when it's just about ownership.\n\nCan anyone offer insight into understanding this? Is it something about him I don't quite understand clearly, or something unusual that I should try to talk to him about?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, what is best for my dog?\nPOST: A little bit of background to start: the dog in question is a young stray that one of my old college roommates found in South Carolina. She brought him home for me on the 1st of June this year, and he has lived with me ever since. I am unsure of the dog's age, but he appears to be less than 2 years old (based on his teeth). Every since about the 3rd night I have had him, the dog has been super attached to me. He follows me every where, and whenever I leave him (even for an hour), he gets noticeably sad. When I leave him for the night, he usually sleeps in my room or on my bed. Towards the end of June, my college lease expired and I moved back home to Chicago to live with my mom and sister. They both immediately became attached to my dog, and my dog to them. When I was still at school and living in an apartment, my dog was never able to be outside, except when I would take him on walks. Living at my mom's house, he's had access to a large backyard, and he loves it! He is out there for hours at a time. We live along a public park, and he gets to see other dogs nearly everyday. \n\nSo now comes the question: just tonight, I accepted a job in the Los Angeles area. What should I do with my dog? My mom and sister want him to stay here with them, but I want to do what is best for the dog. If he comes with me, he'll be with his master, but he'll be living in an apartment again with no backyard. If he stay here, he'll be away from me, but he'll have access to a huge yard whenever he wants. What should I do? Obviously, I want to take him with me, but if that's not what is best for him, I won't do that.\nTL;DR:"}

I assume he was scared about 3 guys staying in his apartment because we were the first males he rented too in years. \n\nWell now comes the end of last semester, we found another lease and signed it because we know and like the landlord and did not like this one.

To my surprise, my bf did not immediately laugh or agree with me; I thought this would be a point we would have in common.  When we continued to talk, he expressed that he thought that we would eventually have a joint Facebook account once we lived together (which we plan to do). I laughed it off and told him I would share my password with him since I'm not engaged in any covert activity on Facebook, but he still insisted that a joint account was better. When I questioned why we would do that, he explained that he thought it would be \"easier\" and that our families wouldn't have to go to two different pages to see updates, etc.  I explained that our pages are linked via the \"in a relationship\" feature and I could tag him in anything that both parties need to see if that's an issue, but it made no difference in his opinion that we should do the joint account.\n\nBut then, the conversation took another turn; after the Facebook discussion, my bf then proceeds to say he thinks we should completely \"join our digital lives\" - set up a joint email address, Facebook, the works.  His reasoning is that we have joined our lives together in the \"real world\" so our digital worlds should be joined too.  However, he is active here on Reddit - so I specifically asked about using a joint Reddit account - he balked at this, saying that he doesn't want to see my \"yarn stuff\" on his feed since I subscribe to a lot of crafty type subs.  Let me also add he has never shared his Reddit username with me, even though he knows the main one that I use.\n\nWe have had no trust issues, communicate exceptionally well, and have talked about pretty much every subject under the sun.  I have nothing to hide from him on any of my accounts, just feel that it is unneccessary and odd to have joint accounts.  So what to do?  He seems very adamant on this issue, and doesn't seem to be budging.\nTL;DR:"}

I fell in love fast but she had just gotten out of a relationship and couldn't think about dating but we basically ended up in an emotional relationship. Which was fine, she lives in another country. We've been visiting each other a lot, and back in december she decided she was ready to try being in a relationship with me, but it only lasted about a week. We made out a couple times, and then she freaked out. She has some pretty serious issues with love and relationships, so it wasn't a huge surprise, but still incredibly disappointing.\n\nWe've been working really closely together, she started a new career as a filmmaker recently and I've become an integral part of that career. We've worked on several projects together and we both agree we make each other better at what we do. It's really unlike anything either of us have ever been part of, but she won't let it become romantic.\n\nShe was just visiting me to work on a new project and left yesterday and I feel like I have to end it. She told me a few nights ago she felt like she was ready to pursue a relationship, but she wasn't talking about me, and when I kind of mentioned it the next day she said I needed to find a way to deal with my feelings or things would go bad. And she's right, because if she meets someone else I'm going to be heartbroken. In fact I already am.\n\nShe's been emailing me and texting me about the current project and she wants me to help her write her first feature script, and when she asked me to it made me really happy, but I feel like I have to end it before she meets someone else. I have a letter written and ready to send via email (I know if I try it face to face over skype I won't say the things I want to say). \n\nI just need some assurance that this is the right thing to do.

She treats me so well and I have tried to do the same, but maybe not this weekend.

Well this past Friday night I decided it would be a good idea to drink at my house with a couple of my friends, guys and girls. Things were going fine until someone broke out the cheap vodka.  I'm typically a beer drinker, so I don't really know my limits with hard alcohol. A few shots later and things start to get hazy. I woke up the next morning, hungover as hell, laying next to one of my girl friends on my couch. I don't recall us doing anything sexual, and I'm nearly positive that we didn't, but I do remember her asking if I had a girlfriend. I don't remember my response or really anything after that point. I feel as though I probably made out with her because I tend to be very kissy when I get too drunk. I've been trying to get the full story from this girl, but she won't tell me over text and she won't meet up with me. At this point in time, my girlfriend does not know, but I'm sure she will soon. This entire weekend, I have been filled with a huge amount of guilt. Am I a complete scumbag, Reddit? Do I tell her I might have fucked up now before she might find out from someone else?

About three weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to start learning app development for iOS as a hobby and bought a Mac Mini. I have quite a few plausible ideas that I could do after a ton of learning. I think about it all the time, I find it pretty entertaining, and it could help resumes after school.\n\nSo here's the issue. Instead of going through the online classes on my Mac, I always end up spending my time on my desktop computer where it has about 40 games, and 400gb of shows and movies. I will come home, and then play Battlefield while watching TV for hours on end. I tell myself \"I'll just finish this episode and then switch to my Mac.\", then just start another episode afterwards. I actually broke a controller today and hoped that it would force me to stop playing games. I ended up playing with my keyboard and mouse instead. I end up wasting my entire day somehow; over and over and over. And I know that I'm wasting time *AS* I waste it! What really is messing with me is the fact that I **really really DO want work on the app development! I literally look forward to it, but I cannot, for some reason, ever actually do it.**\n\nHow do I combat this? Do I delete the games and shows on my desktop? Is that extreme? Going back to this Summer, I'm hoping that all the extra time will let me focus on learning and working more, but I know that if this trend continues I will just waste it on some online game and TV.

He hadn't been in town for several years and he was only going to be available to hang out for 1-2 hours  with the old gang during his 2 night stay.\n\nEveryone was expecting him to show up (albeit a bit late, as his plane arrived around 10 and he had to regroup with his associates before getting let go. They let him out and we only have about 2 hours left before the bars close. There is one particular bar that we planned on going to, as it gets particularly fun.\n\nI was expecting maybe 15 people, but this figure ballooned to at least 30 people total. Even if they weren't all there expecting my friend to show up, im sure my friend felt like a rock star and it was my responsibility to get him to the destination.\n\nWe park and it's about 12:30. I see two empty beer cans on the curb. I pick them up because I usually do when I see liter and I looked for the nearest trash can. There were none. So I walk to the front of the bar. Surely there will be one in front. As I get to the front the doorman sees the beer cans and they tell me I can't bring them inside. I explain to them that they were trash someone left behind and I was just going to throw them away. They proceed to explain that since I was already seen with them, that I was prohibited from entering the bar! They were apologetic but explained that there was nothing they could do and that it was a law that nobody knows because obviously nobody is idiotic enough to bring a beer can to the entrance of a bar. Since I had two beer cans, my friend was implicated in the situation as well and was not allowed in. \n\nI shamefully called my friends inside who were gleefully thankful that they had this on me. Our night was pretty much shot. Try getting 30 people to transplant themselves from a bar. Five friends ended up leaving and coming with us to another bar but by the time we got there it was already 1:30. We went to Taco Cabana afterwards.\nTL;DR:"}

Have been seeing each other for about 7 years before that. He has been on Propecia for 2.5 years. When he first went on Propecia, we read extensively on Propecia (he's a scientist, I'm a doctor) and the side effects. Till today, he has still refused to acknowledge that Propecia is teratogenic (no evidence, etc), although it is classified as under the FDA as pregnancy category X. \nBefore he went on it 2.5 years ago, I told him categorically that I want him to stop Propecia for at least 3 months before we try for a baby. He didn't agree or disagree. I guess I was dumb to not have discuss this further. And stupid to assume that logically he would do so. \nSo, we have a conversation yesterday about starting a family yesterday, and I told him again that I want him to go off Propecia for at least 3 months before trying. And he drops the bomb saying 'I guess we won't be having kids then'. He basically said that he won't come off Propecia, 'because my hair will drop off in a few weeks'.\nHe then said there was no evidence that it was teratogenic. And he was unwilling to risk losing his hair, if it means some peace of mind for a healthy baby (I know, there can be other things which could result in an otherwise unhealthy child, but at least something which we could have controlled).\nHis question was: what if you knew there was a good chance you would lose your hair if you had kids- would you still do it? I said yes, I would take the chance. Besides there is a 100% chance that I will put on weight, have bigger hips etc.\nHe is vain, he cares about his hair. His brother, who is 2 year older, is losing most of his hair. His hair was thinning before he went on it, but not something people would notice.\nI know I was dumb to assume and not have the proper conversation before marriage. How do we move on from here?\nTL;DR:"}

I just moved to a new place 3 months ago, and we became fast friends after bonding over a bunch of shared interests (rock climbing, hiking, and wine).

We live about an hour apart but our workplaces are 5 minutes away from each other. I don't have many friends here yet, and I don't really like meeting new people, so having Bill is great. Recently though I feel like he's started falling for me. I think I might feel the same way. But, I'm not really in any condition to date anyone right now. At this point Bill has been great. I think I'd have a hard time dealing with losing his friendship.

As we're from different parts of our country we didn't meet over christmas break but still kept in touch. We both returned to our uni city and started seeing each other again more intensively. This is late January. The catch (which she told med early on): She's going abroad for a semester (february \u2013 late summer). We decided we're not going to even try a long distance after seeing each other that briefly. Worth noting is that I also applied for studies abroad, if nothing unsuspected happens I will leave this October.   \n\nSo what's the problem? Well, as we still keep in touch I have troubles seeing where we at. We snap (snap chat, image+text messages for you old foxes) each other daily and talk over facebook from time to time.

In the beginning we were having sex a lot, and around this time (also around the time I started a new BC pill, which has been known to affect libido) I haven't felt that into sex with him. This had me a little worried... Does it mean I'm not attracted to him anymore?\n\nAnyway we were having sex one time and the image of a girl popped into my head. I freaked out and forced it out of my head. Ever since, I have dreaded having sex with him because I'm worried it'll come back.\n\nI have never EVER liked girls or been attracted to them. However, since a few days ago I went on vacation without my boyfriend. I have major anxiety problems. The issue in my relationships is that I always find boys that don't like me enough but I have finally found someone that makes me feel loved. Upon thinking of this, I thought--oh no, what if I mess this up this time? Thus, I started obsessing over the random image of the girl that had popped into my head. I kept thinking \"does this mean anything?\" \"What if I'm lesbian and don't know it?\" \nThen I started testing myself in public and realized that I always notice when girls are pretty.

The problem is that now I have to explain to folks that we've broken up, and I don't want to give them the wrong idea that it was a bad breakup filled with gnashing and weeping, laying in the fetal position listening to Nickleback. I really don't want people saying some bad shit about her when I mention that we've broken up, but I feel like it's going to happen when I say \"We've broken up\" and they'll just respond immediately \"Oh man, well she sucks, you're too good for her.\" At the same time, I don't want to come across as being hung up on her, and that's why I'm refusing to say anything bad because that's not true. The relationship has run its course, but I literally can't say anything bad about her because there's nothing bad to say.\n\nSo, what's the best way of letting folks know we've broken up, but without giving the impression I'm mad at her or that I'm still pining after her?\nTL;DR:"}

I went outside and saw him arguing with his friend (also kind of my friend) and just started blindly swinging at this kid. A very close friend of mine grabbed me by the throat in an attempt to hold me back, and I turned around and punched him in the face. I then grabbed him and slammed him onto the pavement. At this point my brother grabbed me and threw me into a fence to hold me back, completely destroying the fence. So we obviously got kicked out of the house. Keep in mind that these events occurred at my MOTHER'S BOSS'S house, so talk about embarrassing. The girl wasn't supposed to have a party, but of course her parents found out after discovering a completely broken fence.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [23 M] with my GF [21 F] 2.5years, feeling tired of being together sometimes\nPOST: Long story short I have been in the same relationship for the past 2.5 years. Recently I have started to question if we are truly meant to be. I am very happy with our relationship it feels very strong however every now and then I wonder. The only flaws in her is we don't share the same hobbies not like it matters a lot. Main thing being I am big into cars and mechanics and she isn't, pretty normal if you ask me.  We share so much in common though things like how we would want to raise our future kids, manage money, education, etc.\n\nSometimes I guess I wonder can I do better can I find someone who fits every thing I want in a girl. Can I find that 10 vs my 9, I know thats asking for way to much however.  No one is perfect and up till recently this girl was the \"perfect one\" it just seems the longer we are together the more I want to look around again sometimes. I am sure if this was someone else I might still feel the same.  Mind you I am 23 now out of college with a full time job, she is still 21 and finishing school. I know a lot of this is me just not being mature and stop thinking I can always \"Do better\". I guess its like owning a new car \"eventually the new car smell goes away\"\nTL;DR:"}

What are the possible ramifications for me?\nPOST: I apologize for scanty details, this all happened approximately 8 years ago when I was 19ish and trusted my parents, and I don't exactly remember a lot. I'm currently not in contact with them so I'm not able to gain more information. The state this happened in is California. \n\nWhen I was approximately 19 and still very much controlled by my parents, they decided to buy an additional \"income\" property. From what I remember, they lived within a certain mile radius of the new property, so they were unable to get a loan, or a good loan (??). So, they put my name on the mortgage. I'm not sure if I was the primary or a consigner, but I remember signing documents with a notary & I know that the address of the income property still shows up on my previous addresses, and the mortgage shows up on my credit checks. I have never contributed financially to this property, the only thing that links me to it is my name. If it helps, they never rented it out and ended up having family members live in it on their dime. I once received a letter from the mortgage company reminding me to make sure my Tax ID number was correct. They refinanced maybe 5 years after owning it and took my name off of the mortgage. \n\nI know this sounds like such a rookie move, but I was young and had zero life experience, and did whatever my parents told me to. I didn't know any better, buying a house some day wasn't even close to being on my radar. They told me this would help my credit, so I complied. \n\nMy\nTL;DR:"}

I'm from Scotland and its been raining a lot this summer, as usual. Not to be deterred we went out anyway, as any good cyclists do. We hit the first hill and I put my head down, cycling away, when all of a sudden my rear wheel is about a foot off the ground and the front wheel is in the back of a jeep. My chain came off as well so I could only stand there ashamed, soaked and slightly concerned about the jeep as people laughed at me. \n\nThis has also brought up past memories of my biggest embarrassment. \n\nA few years ago I was biking to my local game shop to trade in a few games. Its only a mile or so and I was rushing so I decided to just carry the games in my hand, holding the against the front break. I got to a crossroads and wait to cross. \n\nIt gets dark early here in the winter and all the cars had their lights on. They illuminated the area in the centre like an arena. I push off and pedal a few times. As I reach the middle, the game in my hand begins to slip. I tighten my grip on it, instinctively leaning forward to try and grab it before it escapes my finger tips. I pull it against the break and before I know it I'm head over heels, sprawled out on the road.\n\nI pick myself up and do the standard look-around-to-see-what-can-blame. I dont know why. I knew what happened, those in the cars knew what happened and everyone passing by knew what happened. It was obvious that I was THAT guy. The guy about whom people went home to their husbands, wifes, mothers and fathers and said \"today I saw a dumbass.\"\n\nWhat pains me most is that I traded in my original halo games for crackdown. \n\nSo Reddit, whats the memory that makes you cringe most?\nTL;DR:"}

Things have been going flawlessly, just technically starting going steady. I feel like I might have went a tad overboard with the affection recently and I don't want to scare her, so I'm pulling back a little. She just left a long distance relationship. The distance isn't far for me and her, but its far enough that I don't know how to make sure she remains interested. Human beings aren't meant to be apart for weeks at a time, especially during the first stages of a relationship, there is a serious physical element in this equation. I really don't want to loose her to her naturally loosing interest. I also don't want to smother her because she's busy with school, and I know it's important to leave her her own space to do what she wants.\nTL;DR:"}

What do?\nPOST: Long story, not looking for handouts, maybe just some thoughts or inspiration.\n\nSo, I am 21, employed but only as a contractor with no health care. I have had chronic stomach problems since I was a child, however they have always been inconclusive. It was found that I ended up having stress related stomach migraines, which plagued me till I was about 18. Since I was 19 I started having a new issue, I am chronically Vomiting, almost always. The issue began very soft, and I never really put much thought into it, once a week throwing up, not a big deal right? Then it got worse, twice a week...Thrice a week, etc etc. Now, as it stands, I throw up everyday, and usually after every meal. It wears me out to be like this and I cant keep doing this. Here is where it gets interesting, about a month ago I had severe bleeding from my lower stomach, I went to the hospital (4k in bills btw) and they referred me to a stomach specialist who wanted another thousand and change to probe my stomach and (POSSIBLY) determine some of the causes for my problems, luckily the bleeding is much less frequent but is still problematic. When it happens, it is comparable to a period. These problems, with money, and being sick are preventing me from living my life normally, and I really am unsure what to do. Ideas?\nTL;DR:"}

We also live in the same building. We are very close and both share a lot of similar interests. \n\nSome problems: We rarely have time together due to work (co-op school) and night classes. Time is not really in our control, so this isn't a deal breaker for me (the summer will probably be better), but this trouble gets deeper: Our best bet for dates/activities/etc would be the weekends, but she goes home every weekend because she is very closely bonded to her family. Like \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" close. \n\nI do not like her family because it is safe to say they don't like me. We've only met once: when we went to prom together years ago. We pretty much date in secret, even though they know she has a boyfriend. She will never let me meet them again unless we are 3-4 years older and engaged. We go on a date every 1-2 weeks or so but we text/message each other constantly. I would like to marry her but her clingy family (she has to Facetime/text them constantly) is a huge red flag to me. \n\nAdditionally, we have PIV sex about once a month, and when we do she just cries in pain/hardly tolerates it. I, like most men, love sex and would like to have a better experience. Should I finally move on? I love her emotionally but her family and dry sex life makes me think this would make a horrid marriage.

I've never had an issue getting going and then out of the blue I couldn't get started a few weeks ago with my gf. I had no idea what was going on. I thought I was just stressed form work. We take a five minute break and I'm good to go, it was quick but it was fine. \n\nA week later, we're fooling around after a night of drinking and i'm feeling back to my old self, but it's that time of the month so i settle for a bj. When she's off her period we set up a day to get together and have sex because we both need it. I build it up so much in my head that again I can't get going. I sit there embarrassed feeling awful again for about five more minutes and then I'm able to get up and we have sex. \n\nEver since that time I haven't been able to stop thinking about it and it's driving me absolutely crazy. I'm terrified that it's going to happen again, but I know that if I keep obsessing over it then it will in fact happen again.\n\nI'm in perfect health. I've been taking l-arginine supplements to increase blood flow (have slightly high blood pressure). I exercise daily and have started meditating and doing yoga.

He tells me that he does really want to spend time with me; at one point I did ask him if I had the wrong idea about the two of us and he insisted he was just busy, not that he'd lost interest. Still, he won't make solid plans with me.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is whether you guys think it's worth putting effort into.

We would do everything together, text a lot and in general have a great time. I did not like her as anything more until my senior year when we finally realized that we were a great pair and that we should try being something more. We then dated for 2.5 years and had one of the best relationships of my life. I won't go into detail because I think it's irrelevant for this post but when we went to separate colleges we began to grow apart and finally broke up. We got back together for a few months afterwards but eventually broke up for good. About six months later (with no contact) I asked if we could still be friends because I missed her friendship and genuinely wanted to be her friend again.

I am now home on spring break and for the first week I was home we never even kissed, and I was once again totally understanding and tried not to nag, and every time I try to kiss her she tells me to stop pressuring her. Meanwhile I do absolutely everything for her because I really do love her and I'm worried I've been too nice throughout our relationship and am feeling taken for granted.\n\nFor instance, I do all the little things like tell her how lucky I am and how beautiful she is. I never say no, I give her massages daily and never really say no to anything she asks of me. And I do many larger things, for instance her grandfather has Alzheimer's and I am very close with her family. The other day her grandmother had work and I went over and spent the day with him and took him to breakfast because she asked me too, and I don't mind doing things like that. \n\nAnyway, she seems more and more less interested in me sexually every day, and even though I do so much for her she rarely thanks me and always points out when I make a mistake.

He said he had not, because \"he'll be fine\" and I told him \"you don't know that.\" His answer \"He will.\" I feel like he's in denial and being avoidant and I need to be there for my dad no matter what, as he's been the number one person in my life, and it is my turn to be there for him, but I don't want to make things worse.\nTL;DR:"}

We're not looking for a get rich quick scheme; we are both very willing to put in the hard work, invest our time, and learn what we have to. We just don't know what direction to take.

We're totally great together and we're always having fun! He's so great to me and he makes me happy and I feel like I can't live without him. (By the way, I'm 16 he's 18) We both are very happy with each other and love each other equally. Recently, I've been getting upset because I keep having the feeling that I want to break up with him. I have no idea why. Sometimes, I feel extremely happy and when I'm with him I don't feel sad, but, more often than not I've been feeling sad because I have some feelings that I want to break up. \n\nThere has been a lot of things happening in my life recently that have been making me stressed out, for example, my father is an alcoholic and a drug addict, and my mom is struggling with depression and going off her medicine. They are also probably getting a divorce but I'm not sure. I've been really busy with multiple activities I have after school and trying to make things work with every thing. I also keep thinking about death and what could happen after death and it makes me feel depressed and everything is happening at once. I thought maybe these things could contribute to how I feel. \n\nI've talked to him about how I have these feelings about him and we've gone on a break but we ended it because I started to feel happy again and wanted to go back to him. But recently, I've been getting bad feelings again. The feelings go back and forth, probably every other week.\nCould someone please help me and help me figure out how I'm feeling and why and what I should do?\nTL;DR:"}

It hasn't been working out with them for a while, and they aren't intimate anymore. Despite that she is leading on her current boyfriend by not breaking up with him, she is on a date with new boy right now. She has asked me for advice and I've told her that she needs to break up with her boyfriend but she feels that she can't because it would change the dynamics of their house and make things too awkward (they live with two other people). She hasn't broken up with him, and she hasn't told new boy that she has a boyfriend but claims that she is \"busy falling for\" the new boy. So she's leading two guys on. On my end, my issue is that her boyfriend is my friend so I'm in a tough position. What can I do reddit? am I in a place to tell him?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: I'm 17 and enjoy very little in my life. I don't know if this is because I am depressed, or because I have very picky taste.\nPOST: The last time I've really enjoyed a videogame or movie was when I was about 10 years old. I vividly remember going over to a family friend's house and playing the game Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom, and it was the most exhilarating experience I've ever had. I used to go into movies and come out thinking they were incredible. Now videogames and movies are incredibly dull to me, and I've tried all genres, from Last Year at Marienbad to Synecdoche NY to anime, and I've enjoyed none of it.\n\nWhat do I enjoy? Well, music and literature mostly. But the catch is that I only enjoy a small part of what's acclaimed. I've checked out Jazz, Shoegaze, Hip Hop, Metal, Classical, etc., and I don't enjoy most of them. The exception would be Loveless, but even then I only enjoy that a little. The music I *do* enjoy is indie rock and a few like it, but not much else. Some bands I really enjoy are Yo La Tengo, Broken Social Scene, Duster, Jim O'Rourke, The Unicorns, Red House Painters, Codeine, etc.. Literature is the same, in that I don't like Hemingway or Homer, but I do recall enjoy The Great Gatsby and Hamlet a bit. I don't like any poetry.\n\nThe problem is, that's all. I like a very small amount of the media I take in, and I have no idea if this hints at depression or not. I vaguely remember a time at the beginning of high school when I enjoyed things I heard more, but I don't know if that's because I wasn't depressed or if I hadn't tired myself of whatever the song was innovative for.\nTL;DR:"}

He doesn't even include me in plans or invite me along- like to friend's birthday parties at bars and such. \n\nI have voiced my displeasure with this and things never seem to change. I can't keep saying it, I feel like I'm nagging and almost begging him to spend time with me, which I'm sure is a good ego stroke or something. \n\nI'd like for our relationship to progress and for us to get closer, and at different stages in our on/off history, we have been really close and things have been very nice.

Kind of taking a spiteful tone and not really believing me.\n\nI've been in the process of trying to find out exactly why he broke up with me. The most obvious reason is what he said \"to date other people,\" but I don't know if he wants to just screw other people or find someone else to love (he's dating like a mad man right now).\n\nI THINK the main issue was trust, and I want to know if trust issues can ever be solved. At the very beginning of our relationship I 'cammed' with someone a few times online (I didn't consider it cheating at the time, I know better now). I lied about a lot of stuff, but I realized how wrong I was (young and dumb), and after that we had a solid year of pure truth, full access to my everything, and me being deeply in love with him (made several major sacrifices to show that).\n\nBut he ended up leaving me anyways, and now he can't talk to me because it makes HIM feel bad.

Recently some coworkers of his came here to work for the winter season (a couple) again and he went to hang out with them as he hasn't seen them in a while, fine by me. \n\nThe part that bothers me, is that he spends a lot more alone time with the girl than with me and they do things that we initially as a couple were gonna plan on doing. That bugged me but I know I'm not around much so I thought it was just somebody to hang out with and that's it but then a few days ago we all went out together and it's always just them talking and I noticed there is a \"click\" there, so after we got home I spoke to him and he admitted he is attracted to her, that she is very pretty but that isn't why he hangs out with her and I have nothing to worry about.\n\nI know I most likely have nothing to worry about, but that comment annoyed me. I'm probably just comparing it to how I would act in that situation I guess...if I was hanging out with somebody I was attracted to, spending more time with them that with my partner and having outings that I would usually have with my partner...I would step away because I would feel like I was acting upon certain feelings.\n\nHe thinks I am being very silly and overreacting, but I can't help but feel uncomfortable.

I asked her what was wrong and she told me she's been diagnosed with cervical cancer. \n\nI looked up some stuff online and it looks like one of the more common methods of getting cervical cancer is if you have hpv. \n\nI can't prove that she got hpv from that guy, I guess it can be dormant for quite a while, and I can't prove that the hpv caused the cancer. But I have this sickening feeling in my stomach that this is all her fault, that if she hadn't had the affair she wouldn't have cancer now. \n\nI told my wife that I'm there for her 100%. I'd never tell her these feelings I'm having about it being her fault, she doesn't deserve that. I just don't know what to do. The cancer is still in its early stages, and they might be able to fully treat it with chemo and radiation without having to do surgery. I think we'll learn more next week on the follow up. \n\nIt's possible because of this she'll never be able to have kids and now I'm regretting waiting so long to try for them.

Every time we broke it off it was because one or the other of us went into a 'rut': no interest in normal activities, no socialization, a static apathy. We got back together eight months ago and it has once again reached the point where we cannot be around one another because we make each other even more depressed/irritable/angry/sad. \n\nI feel like shit and know he does too, yet I can't summon a scrap of compassion toward him when I see him -- only irritation and resentment. The last time I saw him was a couple of days ago. I tried to shut down that negativity and say nothing, just listen even though he wasn't saying anything. It almost felt real -- then I said he was playing too many videogames. When I do the same thing. What small relief there was vanished and he ignored me until I left.\n\nI sent him an apology. We haven't talked since then though. It's not entirely unusual -- we fight 'silence wars' all the time. This is the first time, though, that we've been so mutually enthusiastic about it. This is the first time I haven't been able to feel a shred of affection for him in that absence. I've largely withdrawn and when I think about us/him it's with a grim disgust. I know I'm being cruel and toxic but it feels like if I let down this barrier that I'll disintegrate and become totally functionless.\n\nPlease -- if anyone has a close relationship with a depressed person, or is depressed themself -- I need your advice.

The thing is, if i never told her i didn't like it, she would've happily went. Vivian is a free spirit. She does what she wants and only does it if she wants to. I don't want to be the one to trap that free spirit but sometimes shes too free (with other guys) and it hurts me. I have told her all this, but she doesn't want to stop, at least not completely. I get jealous (i guess thats what im feeling?) easily but i don't like how close she is to these two.\nTL;DR:"}

In the end I have to start over, and it has been awhile since I have played this game. Things may or may not progress faster or slower then before, but I have sort of forgotten some of the appropriate behaviors.  \nFor instance, dropping her off at her door. How do I keep that from being awkward, or make it clear I'd like to come int (even if it is just to hang out) without being awkward. How do I tell when she wants a kiss again (sort of taken that for granted).\nTL;DR:"}

Shortly after the woman took the kids and left one day with him unable to find her. She got into drugs real bad and was in and out of jail so the kids started staying with her parents. It wasn't until then we knew where they were. The grandparents of the kids contacted my mother and told her we could see them. She wouldn't allow my brother to see them because he too was in a bad spot in his life with drugs and alcohol so we understood. For the past 8 years or so my mom and I have been seeing the kids often and they come visit. A little over two years my brother started cleaning himself up. After a two month stay in jail he got out and I put him to work to keep him busy. He met a nice girl and got serious about the important things in life. He got married and they wanted to to start seeing his kids. For the past 8 years he has had nothing to do with them but sending a little money here and there. He has been sending the grandparents letters and calling them wanting to start seeing the kids and helping pay for things for the past year. She will not return any of his letters or calls. About 9 months ago he got diagnosed with diabetes and was told he couldn't work for close to a year so now he is back in school. The grandmother is now wanting to take him to court to make him relinquish his rights to the kids. My brother is in school and doesn't have the money for a good lawyer. What can I/we do to make sure this doesn't happen. He's turned his life around and we feel if he loses his chance for these kids he's going to fall back off into old habits.

She ranted at me how I'm a silly little boy and need to grow up and burn all my 'toys' or she will leave me for a real man.\nI was so utterly blown away I just stopped in my tracks... I called my friend and said I had to cancel as I wasn't feeling too bright. Lisa stormed out and said she was off to see her friends at our local bar.\n\nSo Reddit, what do I do?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [27 M] with my girlfriend [25 F] together 5 years, girlfriend agreed to live-in dog sit for two weeks.\nPOST: My girlfriend agreed to live-in dog sit for a friend for two weeks without first discussing it with me. I don't care about the dog sitting or her doing it, it bothers me that she didn't discuss it with me first. I feel two weeks is a long enough amount of time to warrant a discussion ahead of agreeing. The time frame is in July, my girlfriend and I both work a lot during the year, I'm a taxpro and from Jan-Apr I may as well not exist as far as family and friends are concerned. I would have liked to take the opportunity for us to go on some trips and spend time together during the summer. \n\nWhen I told my girlfriend how I felt she seemed more concerned about not needing permission, which I immediately agreed with her on, it's a relationship not a hostage situation, we both do whatever we want. I kept asking her how she would have felt had I offered to dog sit for one of my friends for two weeks without at least checking to see if we had plans first but she kept being defensive about not needing permission. Eventually she told me because it's for a friend I don't like she didn't want to talk to me about it anyways because I would have asked her not to do it, which is true, but at least I wouldn't of felt like she went behind my back. \n\nI've been known to overact, is this one of those instances or is it really totally normal to leave the household for two weeks without talking about it first? I asked if maybe she could dog sit for a week and someone else do it the other week, so she's not committed for two weeks, but at the time my girlfriend was still being defensive and didn't want to hear it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25 M] with my gf [23 F] of 1 year live togheter, my jelousy is a problem, am I in the wrong?\nPOST: So, me and my girlfriend have been together for 1 year and it has been great. Although I have become kinda jelous lately and here is why:\n\nShe's going away on trips with her school, there are three to be exact so she will be sharing a room with mixed guys and girls. There is a lot of alcohol involved in these trips and a lot of partying. I'm jelous for obvious reasons, I don't trust her when she's drunk. \n\nBUT she has never done anything to make me distrust her (to my knowledge). I feel like a piece of crap. I tried to be very honest about me being jelous, but she says that there is nothing she can say or do that will make me feel better. She also says that my jelousy will only make it more likely that she would be unfaithful, which also feels like crap because now it feels like a can't be honest and have to fake that I'm totally okay with her going away for three separate weeks and partying hard in fear of her fooling around with other guys. \n\nI think a major reason of me not being okay with this is that whenever she is with me, she doesn't want to drink. She has only been drunk ONE time with me and that night ended in a disaster. It feels like if I knew that she was a normal person when she was drunk I would be okay with this, but I don't know her \"drunk self\" and I feel like this is the core issue. Does this make sense, or am I a crazy boyfriend who's thinking completely irrationally?\nTL;DR:"}

I asked about this once before and got help but now things have changed and I need more help. Been dating this woman for about a month and a half were having a great time. She has made it clear though that she wants to be single so she can enjoy dating and meeting new people. To this point it has not been much of an issue for me as all the other men have been creepers who she sees once and never talks with again. But the last two have made an impression and now I have some actual competition. Im not handling the jealousy well, she thinks its cute, while I go crazy wondering what happens, which she then tells me and that doesn't help. The problem is that before we started dating we were and still are best friends. I'm in love with her but I'm afraid to tell her and get F'zoned. Im not worried that she is sleeping around, she has made that abundantly clear that she will only do that once she is in a real bf/gf relationship.

Less than one week prior to the breakup, we went looking for an engagement ring and I brought his parents under my phone contract.\n\nThe breakup definitely was not mutual and I was caught off guard, but it didn't result in yelling or anything like that. There were definitely lots of tears though.\n\nHe told me he hasn't been happy for the past two months, he wanted to end the relationship while it was still ok. He said there were cultural differences (what his mom wanted was not what I wanted). He also said that he wasn't a relationship type of guy and the relationship was the most challenging and longest he's been in. He said that he felt like he was walking on eggshells when talking to me, and he felt that I was constantly babysitting him.\n\nGranted, I agree that the past 6 months were challenging with so many stressful things happening in our lives (we both worked for unstable companies, I was finishing grad school, he was renovating his new first house, and both our parents were pressuring us to get married).\n\nI'm starting to heal and it has been the most difficult week I've experienced.

Practically everybody who went to see the movie already knew by heart the exchange between Captain America and Iron Man (Cap: \"Big man in a suit of armor; take that away, and what are you?\" Stark: \"Genius, Billionaire, Playboy Philanthropist.\")\n\nIn the preview, Tony Stark gives off the line with his classic Stark snarkiness and a big grin, playing the line for laughs, but in the movie, the exchange takes place in the middle of a heated debate, with tempers mounting on all sides, and he gives the line in an undertone of loathsome disgust. Now, of course it's normal for certain parts from the trailers to be changed or removed from the final cut of the movie, but this is different. The way that Stark gives the line in the film is in direct contrast to the audience's expectations: an element that was meant to be lighthearted is instead used in one of the heaviest scenes in the movie. For future audiences (or for anyone who somehow managed to miss all of the commercials), there's nothing wrong or incomplete about the way the line is given (or the scene as a whole), but for those who were already immersed in the advertising, it gives an extra little oomph to that scene.\n\nSo my question is, are there other examples of things like this? Other movies that deliberately misrepresented some aspect of the movie in their ad campaign, be it a single line or an entire theme or plot arc, so that the audience would be thrown off when they actually saw the movie for the first time? Something that would be lost on people who hadn't seen the ads?\nTL;DR:"}

The first person I spoke with hung up on me after I asked about the inconsistency.

After getting a manager on the phone they told me it wasn't their fault that the payment was posted 2 days after I had submitted the payment. He told me from there that he would not reverse the fee as it was justified and it was my fault for not knowing how their payment system worked. I asked to cancel the card but was told if I did they would ding my credit. Any suggestions Reddit?

We had a short fling but it ended with the brother being sort of an asshat.

We made the decision to have kids, and last year our beautiful baby girl was born. Since then my wife made the decision to stay at home and take care of her. Before kids we would both split the chores, she would clean the house, we would both cook, I would do dishes and stuff like that. Recently I stepped up at work, and started to climb the ranks to provide for my family. My wife on the other hand has started to well, not do the chores. I asked her about it and she just said the usual stuff like \"I'm tired\" , \"I'll do it later\" , \"Honey, I said I would do it\". And we'll she doesn't. It's gotten to the point where I do all the cooking, wash all the dishes, walk the dog, while she just talks to her friends on the phone for HOURS on end! When I confronted her, she LOST IT. She started screaming about how I didn't appreciate her or anything and just stormed up to our room. I ended up caring for my daughter the rest of the night, putting her to bed, diaper changing etc. The next morning she cold shouldered me, and I just left for work.

I grew up in a quiet suburb, slow to make friends, hardly went out even after turning 21 (drinking age where I grew up) at university. She is only my third girlfriend, but the first serious one. She has been in love before and been with several other guys intimately. I have only been with two girls previously, and they were short lived.\n\nWe have been talking about getting more serious in our relationship and she is ready to settle down, she told me. I know that is what I want as well, but I am having trouble with a couple things. Regardless of whether or not I settle down with her, I need to accept that I will never be able to go back and relive my adolescence. Somehow I need to accept that. I cannot find a way. Secondly, staying with her means a constant reminder of something I want, but can't have. There must be some way to get passed this.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel like this is a heavy burden on me, and it makes me feel inadequate and worthless most of the time.  I realize that this feeling/energy will likely come out in any social interaction I have, and will probably scare off any sane girl that I am interested in, which leads me to my question.\n\nHow can I learn to be happy by myself?  I feel like getting laid (hell, even my first kiss would be great at this point) or getting a steady girlfriend would massively improve my general happiness and self-esteem, even though I know deep down that this would not solve my issues, and they would carry over into the relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

We had shared a completely happy and healthy relationship up until now. \n\nMy boyfriend had a couple drinks, and another woman came up to him and kissed him. He kissed her back for about 2 minutes then he ended the kiss, and left her at the bar. However, he became too nervous to tell me... I saw him texting her, and I asked who she was. He  stalled, then said just some girl who was pursuing him. I have never looked through his phone before, and have never thought I'd have to, but I could tell he was lying to me. This is the first time he's ever cheated, and the first time he's ever lied to me. When I went through his phone I saw she sent him flirty messages, knowing he was in a relationship, he didn't flirt back but he also didn't deter her from flirting. \n\nWhen I confronted him, he was completely remorseful, and said he was planning on telling me about the situation. However, I feel our relationship has been seriously tainted by this because I can no longer fully trust him. I could easily forgive the kiss if he was honest with me, but not stopping her from pursuing him and then lying is the problem.\n\nI need to know if trust is ever fully restored to a relationship after someone tells a lie like this?\nTL;DR:"}

We both want to be together (as brought up by both of us various times). The problem is not the relationship per se but my lack of discipline and control in my own life.\n\nWe are both studying a career in science but I am half assing through it and life in general like there is no tomorrow. I have never been disciplined and/or other good qualities that help one have a stable life. I am studying what I want, the problem is that avoid problems when they are presented to me.

I have thought about a solution and these past weeks I have actually gotten around to studying and feel like like I am approaching an actual solution. This studying is not going to be enough to save the semester and when I get my grades back this is going to probably cause a break up between me and him. This has happened many times. I slack off, I fail everything and say I will change very convincingly and some times he stays with me, sometimes we break up for a while. I think that what I do is very wrong but this time I think I can actually change. \n \nHow can I speak to him about this and make it seem like the real thing this time? Its not to say I have lied in the past about wanting to change but this time I feel like I have gone deeper in to what the problem is.

He seems nice and reads a lot of fantasy books and seems like a cool person, but he's not super outgoing and neither am I and I don't know how to connect to this person. I feel like I'm doing something wrong. When we're in the room together we just sit on our beds on our computers or phones and don't really talk to each other. Sometimes we talk about the door closing loudly, or homework, but usually just silence. We peacefully coexist and have no problems except I feel like we should have more of a connection.

I've considered leaving him a note or something saying that, but that might be perceived as creepy or something.\n\nBut doing nothing seems like the wrong thing to do. But I don't know what to do. I'm scared of him being mad at me - when I get upset I get annoyed at other people for not understanding or for just little things. I want us to be friends.

One side suggested I keep him as a friend since he's a really good friend and just tell him to stop crossing the line since those actions are not platonic.

I drive a crappy car, and have a pretty secure job. How much I make actually largely depends on how much overtime I work, as I can work as much as I want so I could realistically make 150000+ before taxes if I wanted to work 80 hours a week (some guys at the company do, the demand for us is insane). I'm 22 and intend to keep renting an apartment probably for a while, as ,my job does involve quite a bit of travel, and I like the mobility of being able to move around. I'm looking for a realistic price range of car. I probably won't buy anything right away, but I want to start looking, so I can keep my eye open for a good deal. \n\nI know people are going to caution me against thinking I have job security, but tbh what I do is incredibly specialized, and is very in demand. Although if I went to another company I might not get as much, I could probably leave and find another job in a week. That being said I want to wait a while and build up a nest egg before buying a car, as I realize it's probably the smarter thing to do. I don't plan on getting married anytime soon, and don't ever plan to have kids, although I've been told that will change ( I really don't think it will though...) \n\nI'm not sure what I'm missing if anything. As far as insurance goes I'm covered under my parents for 4 more years. 401k stuff happens, whatever the max contribution they match I'm contributing. So I'm probably looking at between 50k and 60k to play around with if my math is right. \n\nThanks for any advice, I'm a bit new to this but read on here a lot.\nTL;DR:"}

He's close to my family, met my friends, super understanding and sweet. Thing is - both of us are busy with our own lives. We still talk, but not as much. Also, we're almost complete opposites in terms of hobbies and lifestyles and how we behave and dress etc. He's proper (like he doesn't smoke etc) while I'm alternative (i'm into piercings, tattoos and all).

Sometimes I just feel like I'm no longer equipped to handle it. It's rubbing off on me. \n\nHe seems to be happier with his friends than he is with me. He says it just seems that way because his friends don't get into emotional things and it's easy to just ignore that stuff with them.

If he finds out while he's here and moves out, none of us will be able to afford the house anymore and I really don't want to move as I love the place.\n\nWhat do I do?? Both of them are really good friends of mine and I don't want to intrude, but if this ends badly I don't want to be taken down with it. Should I talk to her/her bf or should I just stay out of it? I mean, I really don't have any solid evidence. Just the fact that he comes over late all the time, and one night I spotted them out the window and their faces looked close together but I honestly couldn't see much else. If I were dating her I would not be comfortable with this behavior.\n\nSo sorry for formatting or grammar or anything. It's late and I'm on my mobile. I woke up because I heard the dog barking because he came over again.)\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How do I(17F) approach a former friend/crush(17M) after two years of complete awkwardness? Help appreciated!\nPOST: Throwaway, cuz duh.\n(I'm Nigerian, he's Pakistani/Muslim)\n\nAlmost three years ago, I had class with this guy. He always flirted with me- he would always interrupt my conversations when I would talk to other people, stare at me a lot, copy what I was doing, make inappropriate jokes to me, always try to get my attention, everything. After some harsh words (on my side) and misunderstandings (on both parts) we didn't talk much anymore. I told him that I liked him twice (or, at least I attempted to) but he told he he didn't care and he didn't want to know.\n\nFast forward two years later, and we either avoid each other like the plague or pretend the other doesn't exist, or stare at each other whenever we cross paths. There have been quite a few times we have run into each other accidentally in the past two years. I wouldn't be bothered but recently my brother told me that the guy was asking him if he was associated with me, but my brother said no and the guy left.\n\nAnd recently the guy walked into the same class (after school) that I was in with a mutual friend of ours. He stared at me for a few seconds, awkwardly pursed his mouth and left. It was very awkward. There were more incidents after this but this was the most uncomfortable aura surrounding them.\n\nI didn't understand what's going on. I wanted to confront him but he seemed like he doesn't want to be bothered. Along with junior year hassles I couldn't be bothered and I just ignored everything. Now senior year is approaching and from talking to a mutual friend I discovered that the guy and I might have at least one class together. Fuck. What can I do?\nTL;DR:"}

I feel really grateful for her influence on my development, and very deeply connected to her.

Since it is her vision and intellect that most inspire me, I would like to ask her if I can have her skull after she has passed away. The problems are... it sounds creepy as fuck, and my dad is Orthodox Christian, so he believes that her remains must be kept intact for her to rise again when Jesus returns. She's a rational person, but respects his wishes. How can I make my case without being officially licensed as the family freakshow?\nTL;DR:"}

[19F, 20M]\nPOST: I [19F] recently started seeing this guy [20M] who I met in high school but hadn't seen in over two years. We re-met, hit it off and exchanged numbers. He called me for a date the next day and it went great. A couple days later he invited me out again. He was sweet, funny, planned great dates and he really turned me on (we didn't do anything sexual besides make out, but I felt serious chemistry). \n\nOn the second date, he brought up the fact that he had \"bad luck with girls\". I tried to seem sympathetic, which caused him to launch into a story about meeting a girl at a party, kissing her and being later rejected by her. He said that he tends to crush quickly on girls who listen to him and they often don't reciprocate feelings (I inferred that they reciprocate sexual advances). He was also overweight in high school and said that after he got fit he enjoyed the attention he got from girls and went through a \"manwhore\" phase. It was a weird conversation and thankfully it didn't last long. We fooled around a bit afterwards and he said that he was \"trying not to jump the gun and remember it was just a second date\" and said he had habit of rushing things. I said I don't move quite that fast and he didn't try anything with me besides kissing and a bit of fondling.\n\nTHIS conversation, though, is ruining my attraction to him! He said he's interested, he texts me every night to ask about my day, he's got another date planned for this week...but I'm having trouble seeing him as having relationship potential. He portrayed himself as kind of desperate, which made me feel bad about myself because it seems like there's no reason he chose me or was attracted to me in particular- I was just available. It sounded like he gets (or convinces himself that he has) feelings for pretty much anyone that pays him any attention. Is he just insecure and awkward, or should I run for the hills?\nTL;DR:"}

I get excited thinking about the plans we've made because she follows through 90% of the time, but the times that she doesn't is seriously annoying because I get really excited and keep waiting for her to text me. It's hard to pretend I'm not irritated with her. She just did it again today. I don't event want to respond to her right now.  \n  \nI feel like maybe she just doesn't want to go but doesn't want to hurt my feelings. She's a people pleaser and is really bad at saying things straight. I'm just looking for advice on if I should ignore it or tell her that it's honestly getting annoying. The thing is, the only plans she ever ghosts me on are the plans that I'VE suggested. If she suggests it, she shows up. It's annoying but she's pretty awesome besides this and I haven't had a friend in maybe 6 or 7 years so I don't want to ruin it and we honestly have a great time when we're together.  \n  \nIt also makes me wonder how many things she's enthusiastically agreed with me on that maybe she's just been lying about to avoid telling the truth that she has a different opinion.\nTL;DR:"}

Our breakup was what I believe to be atypical, with her kissing me and saying \"I love you\" before she left, and when I asked her if she wanted her stuff from my place, she said she wanted me to keep it.\n\nA few nights later, I apologized and told her that I believed she made the right decision and hoped she was doing well. She was really thankful and glad that our breakup wasn't bad, because it wasn't reflective of our relationship. I sent her a message saying that I was sorry and that I hoped that she would at least consider having me back-- she said she understood this and that she loved me, but she just wanted to see what happen if we took some time away. I had only messaged her a week later to see if she would like to meet me-- I hadn't specified why, but I haven't yet told her about my OCD diagnosis and the treatment I'm undergoing, but I wanted to say something to see if this would effect her decision to get back with me or not.

It was a small class; give or take 20 students. So as usual, our professor had us start with some ice breakers to get to know each other. And you were paired up with whomever was next to you. The information we had to give each other was pretty common: name, age, major, and an interesting fact about yourself. It just so happened that I was next to this cute girl, so I thought this was my chance to talk her. Now this is where I fucked up. Everything begins smoothly, I answer all her questions then I ask her likewise. When I get to the interesting fact, she says \"I want to work with kids\" except I understood \"I want seven kids\". Naturally, I was then a bit hazed by this alleged reply but I didn't question her about it. Now the professor begins to engage with the class, and everyone has to introduce their partner to the class. Surely, I eventually introduce my partner, for the sake of the post I'll call her \"Nancy\", to the class. As I tell everyone that she wants seven kids, Nancy replies WAIT WHAT?!?

There were certainly some fascinating sections (most of which that I can recall involve some violent dust-up as the gang moves from one town to the next), and it's clear McCarthy is a very skilled prose stylist, but now that I've finished All The Pretty Horses, I get the impression that all of his novels are more like expansive and detailed landscape paintings that capture the southwestern US at its most bucolic, homey in as many different shades of red and orange as possible. \n\nAll of his characters seems to be different shades of the same 'Marlboro Man' archetype, as well, and while I know it's easily argued that this could 'be the point' of all his storytelling, I just don't find it very compelling to read about (or even very relevant to discuss) how some rough-neck lives his rough-neck life, and how all those he associate with tend to be rough-necks as well, and that's just that about that. *hawk; spittoon; ding!* Not to mention, his characters see little change over the course of all the stories of his I've read.\n\nIt's possible I just find no meaning in the 'literary Western genre' he seems to be working in, but for all of the McCarthy I've read, it's been nothing but a meditative experience slogging through page after page of description after description of landscapes, sunsets, wide expanses. I would, however, be interested in his take on the 'cowboy aesthetic' moved abroad--and I mean much farther than just Mexico, like some retired Arizona farmhand trying to strike it rich in Mongolia, or something along those lines.\nTL;DR:"}

I missed her like crazy and she missed me like crazy. We agreed to have a written marriage so she could come with me and then we would have the actual ceremony when I was done training.

I feel like I am taking care of her, than her actually being my partner. I didn't realize how lazy she can be until actually living with her. I have to keep reminding her of things to do and I feel like I am controlling her. What I loved about her is that I can be blatant with her and she can do the same to me. But now, I hold my tongue about topics that I know would hurt her feelings. I've also noticed that I have lost my sexual attraction to her sometime during us living together. I can't stand my mother-in-law and I use to. I realize she's childish, vain and over emotional. She up and invited herself to stay at my place without asking my permission so that she could come and visit her daughter that she misses so much... Which has me worried because I don't want her unexpectedly visiting our place all the time when we move back closer to home when my training is done. Even when I tried standing up to her, she still wouldn't listen to me. It took her sister to tell her to back off, for her to finally back off. \n\nSo my question is, Is this all normal for newly weds? Or did basic training change me somehow? I don't want to be married to what is called a dependipie in the military. We've talked about all of these topics... And as of right now, I can see this marriage failing the path it's heading...

By the time I get there ~7:45 AM I'm still feeling half asleep. So I'm walking into the building a few paces ahead of this girl that I've seen around the office, she's pretty and I'm shy... we've never really talked. \n\nAnyway, I get to the door and hold it open for her, she says thank you, and I start to say \"no problem\" but then the sleepy half of my brain decided I should say \"of course\" instead. So it sorta came out as \"Nnnfcourse.\"\n\nAn hour later I got called into the security office... There I find the cute girl, her manager, the head of security and one of her guards, and the site manager. So the managers and head of security bring me into an office and ask me \"What the hell were you thinking?!\" At this point I'm pretty much just trying to figure out what's going on. \n\nSo I asked what they were talking about. Apparently the girl thought I said \"Intercourse!\" I guess she was creeped out and told her manager and he kinda blew it up from there. Luckily the security people and site manager know me pretty well and it all turned into a bit of a laugh. I still had to apologize to the girl though, but at least we've talked! Right?\nTL;DR:"}

Normal or not?\nPOST: Recently been talking to this really great guy over the last month and a half (he's away on long term business for the last 2 months, but he lives near me). Things were going really great. He was calling me every night and we were texting throughout the day, a mixture of normal and flirty stuff. Every morning I'd wake up to a good morning text and he'd send a good night one too.\n\nA few nights ago he open up to me that his long term girlfriend who he was with 4 years ago really messed with his head (seems she was really unwell), so much so that he had a breakdown and it took him a while to recover. He said he is now really wary as a result. He said he wanted to tell me because he has messed up potential relationships before because of it and he didn't want to make the same mistake. I was understanding and asked him if there was anything I should do to make him feel more relaxed to which he told me that I just needed to keep being me because I was doing everything right.\n\nSince then he's really dropped off. He still texts me every morning and evening to check in and out, but the amount has really dropped off. I was just wondering if this a normal thing to happen or if he's just interest?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm extremely worried about her drinking habits... I'd say she goes out drinking around 3-4 times a week though it can vary. This has been happening every week for the past ~month and a half maybe 2 months. Now, I'd be fine with this if it wasnt for the fact that every time she goes and drinks she gets very drunk, often drinking a bottle a wine or more a night.\n\nI'm worried sick. I dont know what to do... I feel like a massive dick and an extrmemely shitty boyfriend when I ask her to slow down on the drinking or have a small break. I feel like I'm losing her. She often doesnt speak to me very much or ignores my messages when she drinks (drunk) and I understand this as shes out having fun but when thats multiple times a week being ignored its kinda annoying.\n\nShe says she doesnt drink too much and she loves it because its fun. I dont know if i'm being a twat and a shitty boyfriend or if she really has a problem...either way I'm worried sick.\n\nI want her to have fun and enjoy herself and be with her friends but I really dont think its good to be drinking so much. I dont know if I can go on worrying so much, I feel like it would be better if I left her because then she wouldnt have me on her back about drinking. She understands why I worry and she really is an awesome girlfriend and I love her to bits but if she doesnt tone it down I dont know what I'm gonna do. As an added note, she suffers from depression sometimes...which could be the cause but she doesnt really like talking about her depression.\n\nThanks...looking forward to your replies...\nTL;DR:"}

We just started becoming friends again, but I just found out that over winter break she and one of my best friends, who is my other neighbor farther down the street, have started seeing each other behind my back. I mentioned it to my friend and told him I wasn't really comfortable with it and he said he didn't want to lose me as a friend. I haven't really said anything to him since. I don't really know how to handle the situation. Because I can't tell him what to do because hes a grown adult. But I am 100% not ok with him and her being a thing, and will probably not be able to continue being his friend if he goes through with it, simply because he went behind my back, cause he knew i wouldn't be ok with it, and I feel betrayed. Another thing to consider is that a large majority of my friends, and people I hang out with almost daily live with him.\nTL;DR:"}

However, the last few weeks, she's been slightly distant, and we've been hanging out gradually less and less. I brought it up with her, and she says that she's busy, that I have nothing to worry about, and that if it was a problem with me, she would tell me. Fair enough, I believed her. Over the last two weeks, I've seen her maybe twice, and on weekends. She's an art student, and I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt on the whole busy thing, but today something pissed me off. She finally finished her major painting that was due today, and she says that she only has a little bit of homework to do tonight. I ask if that means that I can see her tonight, seeing as I haven't seen her since our date Saturday. She says she doesn't know yet, but maybe. I say okay, just let me know. We continued chatting for the rest of today. I went to check my twitter, and I saw that she made a post, saying how badly she wants to hang out with someone. WTF? I don't know if she actually went and hung out with someone, or if she was just venting about how frustrated she is with school. As far as I know, she doesn't really have any other friends, aside from one other guy she met a week or so ago, and she told me they haven't hung out during our date.\nTL;DR:"}

Then we met and got along really really well. We had heaps in common. We hung out a few times, I even met some of his friends. Then I didn't hear anything from him for over a week. Then he starts sending me emails telling me he has some issues going on atm, but he is really looking forward to seeing me again. He sends me a couple of these, saying he is sad he missed out on hiking with my friends and I. So, thinking he actually likes me and wants more than just sex, I actually indicate that I like him. I just said I was really disappointed when I didn't hear from him, because I don't meet guys like him often. And invited him to do something with my friends in the future once thing settle down. So of course, after that he stops contacting me again. It's tinder, he just wanted sex, but he was dressing it up as more.  \n  \nFast forward a week, and i'm back tindering. Start talking to this guy. There is some innuendo about burritos and tacos. I mistakenly get the impression he is asking me a really inappropriate question, tell him it's none of his business.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/running\nTITLE: Road vs. Sidewalk: why my right knee prefers the sidewalk\nPOST: A couple weeks ago, after a fantastic 19 mile run, I noticed my right knee was starting to hurt quite a bit. I suspected it was due to a new loop I had recently added on to my regular route to shake things up a bit. My regular route is almost entirely on sidewalk, but this new loop took me on a road with a nice wide run/bike lane for about 3/4 mile. I'd been running on that new loop quite a bit, and had done it 5 times on this 19 mile run.\n\nI really liked the new loop, but I noticed that it made my right leg tired due to the camber of the road to the outside. Even though the road itself is well-maintained and reasonably flat, just the slight incline to the left (since I run on the left side of the road) was enough to force me to slightly pronate with my right foot. This is something I notice any time I run on a road for a race, but it usually isn't that big a deal, since it's just for one day. In this case, I'd been running this new loop quite a bit for a few weeks, and the 19 mile run really sharpened the effect it had.\n\nSo, I iced up my knee, took an extra rest day, and stopped running that loop for a while (I might bring it back at some point, but not run it as often). My knee is much better now, although there's still a little pain.\n\nI know I've read here and elsewhere that a road surface is (slightly) better to run on than a sidewalk surface, in terms of how hard it is on your joints. That may be true, but I wanted to offer my experience on it. I think the way the surface slopes is something that needs to be taken into account.\n\nSo this may seem like kind of a boring story (I fell asleep reading back through it), but just in case someone is having problems with one leg and not the other, it's something to consider as a remedy :)\nTL;DR:"}

She struggled with a bit of depression last year and just within the past month it has come back and hit her pretty hard.  Well after a couple weeks of noticing she was struggling but her not wanting to talk about it she finally decided to admit to me that she was struggling with depression and seeing a counselor.  Reasons for depression are not living up to expectations at college, at home (parents), and then struggling with being apart now that I have recently started grad school a few hours away.\n\nJust yesterday she finally mustard up enough courage to tell her parents that she was struggling with depression and was so upset (bawling) that she had to stay the night at my apartment rather than drive home during the night.  Her parents are extremely old fashioned/religious and did not agree with her decision even though she specifically said she slept in a different room.  Her dad proceeded to tell her that her depression was \"a bunch of crap, to get it together, and not to mess it up for herself by continuing to do this or they would bring her home and stop paying for college\".  Her mom replied by saying \"if she can't figure out whats wrong with herself to quit her job and to quit school...if she can't handle it since (my gf) was the one that chose to go there\".  Not once did either parent even acknowledge the depression...\n\nI spoke with her parents as briefly as possible saying I care about their daughter very much, I really want her to be happy, and I think it would help her tremendously if they gave her support. To which the mom replied \"this is my fourth daughter, I've dealt with plenty of drama, she knows how her parents roll and I don't need your advice\".\nTL;DR:"}

We have a great relationship and communicate with each other openly. Last night she told me that since she has been seeing me she has been aroused by/masturbated to thoughts of me having sex with my ex's/other women.\nIt seems to have something to do with the fact that I have had serious relationships in the past, while she has never had any serious commitments. She feels like she is \"just another girl\" to me because she didn't get me first, although I reassure her this is not the case at all. She has also had to deal with a lot of guys treating her badly, blowing her off, even calling her by another girls name during sex.\nHonestly she is a pretty innocent person. She hates the idea of me being with another women and hates that she is aroused by thinking about it, she said after she masturbates she feels really really guilty and hates herself for it. This whole thing is strange to me because she is quite a jealous (not in a negative way) girlfriend, she likes my attention.\n\nI told her that sexual fantasies are normal, out of our control, and that a lot of people have stranger ones. I told her it is okay for her to have these fantasies, and that it doesn't mean that anything has to happen because of them. She hates having them however (she said she hates \"being turned on by feeling worthless\") and she just wishes she could make them go away, even though I've suggested this probably wont happen through sheer will power.\n\nAny advice here? kind of out of my depth.\nTL;DR:"}

We met through friends and I truly see her as an intelligent, beautiful and caring person.\n\nA bit of an issue that has been on my mind is the way she and her father talk to me.  Earlier in our marriage when we had our disagreements we would sit down and talk about it peacefully until a resolution was reached.  Now if we have any disagreement it quickly resorts to her ignoring my suggestions and name calling under her breath.  This seems to have gotten worse ever since we moved to be near her family.\n\nMe and her father do not have the best relationship.  In his own words he believes his daughter should be married to someone more assertive and someone that does not shy away from social events. \nI do admit, I try and avoid big social events as I truthfully find them quite exhausting.  I don't hold any anger towards him and he has a right to his opinion.  However I found out through my brother and sister in law that whenever my name is mentioned he refers to me as 'the nincompoop', I brought this up with my wife but she seemed to brush aside the issue.\n\nI am starting to think that the way my father in law is talking about me is actually starting to affect the way my wife treats me.  I am considering talking to my father in law one on one but I really doubt I can do anything to change his opinion of me.\n\nMy wife and I both work so I don't think it has anything to do with finances.\n\nCould someone offer any advice as I can really see this getting worse, thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

I've had several girlfriends and one previous long term relationship, but I struggled with intimacy mainly due to what I learned was a serious porn addiction.\n\nI'm not a virgin technically, but I've never orgasmed during sex and my porn addiction caused me to be dis-interested in my otherwise awesome relationship and lose a great girl. I still have a lot of inexperience with actual sex and physical intimacy, even though I've had partners.\n\nI finally realized I had a problem with porn addiction in April and joined the sub-reddit NoFap. I've had my ups and downs, but I've only PMO'd (Porn - Masturbation - Orgasm) about 5 times in the last 2 months which is the biggest step in my progress. However, it's been said it takes about 90 days of abstaining for your brain to \"reset\" the addiction and I'm still very much trying to recover.\n\nThe new woman I'm seeing is every bit as amazing as my last girlfriend, if not more so, and we've already been comfortable enough to share a lot of personal things with each other, but this the one thing I haven't brought up. We've basically only got to second base so far, but I know before we get intimate I'm going to have to tell her about my inexperience and why that is. I don't want to make the same mistake with her as I did the last one, as I want us to have a fullfilling romantic and sexual relationship.\n\nI'm very nervous about bringing up this dark side of my life to her, even though we've grown so close so fast. I've made a lot of progress since April, but it is something I still struggle with and I'm still fighting to fully recover from. How should I break it to her? Will she understand?

On Tuesday she graduated from high school, and will be attending college about 45 minutes away in the Spring, (January). However, I am only going to be a senior. The 23rd of June marks our 1 year anniversary. I guess this seems kind of weird for me to be posting on reddit, I guess I am just nervous of getting the causal response, \"there are more fish in the sea\" or \"you're young, you'll meet someone else\".  \nI really like this girl a lot. We connected so fast and have so much fun together. We hang out all the time, me with her friends, and her with mine, and all together. I think one reason why I'm so worried is because she was and still in my one first true love. I am scared that this separation, not being able to drive five minutes to each other's house and see each other every day at school is going to severely hurt our relationship.  \nA major thing that makes me nervous is she wants to get into the party atmosphere for the first time. She worked hard all through highschool, and now wants to have fun where shes going. Upon taking a college visit she was explaining to me, \"The college is super nice. You would like all the frat's, they have volleyball courts outside almost every one!\" (I am a volleyball player, in SoCal) She also went on to mention, \"Sorry, but all the guys are super hot!\".  \nI dont know, I guess I am freaking myself out a little bit. She isn't even attending first semester, so we still have a while together, as well as all summer before she leaves. Also, people are telling me that I need to enjoy my youth years, and not be waiting all the time. I am a little confused and worried all at the same time, and I could use any input that any of you nice people could have for me.  \nThank you very much!\nTL;DR:"}

And I had to travel a few more times and she did the same thing, one time she stayed up till 3 am and I called her when I arrived and she went to bed late and it screwed her sleeping schedule. There's also other things that happen and usually she's been sad in general because apparently I'm a bit more 'distant' which is kind of true since I don't want to have a negative impact on her but getting farther from her is messing her up to..like a downward spiral. What should I do, she's fantastic otherwise and amazing and all that and that's another reason I don't want her to be obsessive, because she's amazing and should strengthen herself and all that good stuff instead of dragging herself down over myself.

Sometimes, we have problems in the bedroom that's consistent even nowadays, and while I'm still not entirely sure what the issue is, it's always a concern in the back of my head that I'm just not his cup of tea.\n\nLately, I've stumbled across a few stories of men and women coming out after 10-year long marriages with kids.

I really love him but I don't think I can handle the risk of having him come out later in our relationship if it does happen to go well. Even now, it's constantly an issue in the back of my head which sometimes destroys the trust I have left for him.\n\nThe part that really hurt me was that I asked jokingly if he would love me forever, and he said he couldn't respond to that as it would be something that was really serious for him.

You could say I was an overachiever because I was constantly striving for a good GPA all my life.\n\nThis behavior has carried over into my relationship with my current SO, and I'm so afraid of pushing him away because of my insecurity.\n\nFrom dancing to playing instruments, I feel so inferior when I just can't get it immediately. It's like I can't take any criticism at all or I'll get extremely sad and defensive. I know this is wrong and completely unfair to my SO, but I can't help thinking he believes I must be slow and dim-witted.\n\nThe reason I say this, is because he makes me feel like my reactions to obstacles are invalid. Like if I get so frustrated I start crying, he says, \"This problem really isn't that big of a deal, why are you getting so worked up over it?\" It makes me feel like I can't vent or cry at all or he'll question why I'm even doing it in the first place if I get so frustrated.\n\nI'm obviously not in the right either, because I shouldn't get so upset with him when I try to hold back my complaints and tears. I have it in my head that he thinks I should quit if I'm going to complain so much.\n\nOtherwise, everything in our relationship is pretty awesome, I couldn't ask for a better boyfriend.

She went on later about my brother telling her he would be with her as long as she would have him and somehow that translated as an informal future proposal???\n\nI am under the impression that my parents are so happy that my brother broke up with ex and is no longer depressed, that they are ignoring the fact that this new girl obviously has no concept of boundaries.

The district manager is the son of the GM of our store. He's kinda cool, works hard and doesn't mess around back in my area (i'm the dishwasher). Recently, he started coming back asking if I wanted a hug, if he made me all hot and bothered (I dont wear an apron so you can imagine how wet I get) and a few other comments that I hear from other people messing around all the time. However, I while I do want to note that I am NOT against gay people AT ALL, his comments are making me uncomfortable. \n\nSo, Reddit. I ask you. Should I just ignore the comments the best I can and try to keep my distance or should I try to say something to stop it and just hope I don't piss anyone off? I'm afraid that if I say anything and he takes it the wrong way it will piss off the district manager and the general manager. Obviously, I do not want that to happen.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: 1.5 year relationship ends, then a death in the family the next day.\nPOST: so reddit, i need some thoughts and opinions on a messed up situation, thats really leaving me completely reeling.\n\nbackstory, im 26, shes 32 and have been in a relationship for about 1.5 years. Sadly, and due to circumstances that we feel irreconcilable, we have decided to part ways. This alone is sad enough for both of us, and since we live together with her child (11y/o, from a previous marriage.) hasn't exactly been the most comfortable situation as of late. Ive already been packing, as i have a new place lined up for the 1st, and have just been using the spare bedroom in the meantime. This situation is working for us just fine, as difficult and awkward as it may be.\n\nThe issue is that this morning, her mother passed away after a long battle with cancer. It's been a heart wrenching journey for us all, and despite anticipating this, it never makes it easier. So essentially we have a trainwreck that just happened to be caught in the middle of another trainwreck.\n\nMy dilemma is this: the relationship is over, we know that we won't be able to continue on as a couple, and even though it sucks, were not being childish about it. But then here I am. I know she's torn up enough about losing our relationship, and now she loses her mother.\nIm not really sure how to proceed at this point. My remaining to be with her in her time of need feels right - problems or not, we were in a loving relationship for a long time, I feel like i can't abandon her now, when she needs me most. However i also know that my staying wouldn't help our situation in the least, and after the fallout from the death, we're back where we started- with our need to part ways.\nSo reddit, what do you think is \"right\" in this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

As soon as I first struck up a conversation with her, she gave off all the right vibes. A day after we first started talking, she actually initiated conversation with me completely out of the blue (a big deal because she's a very shy person).\n\nA week later, classes ended and that point was when I realized I had a crush on her because of how sad I felt. My only line of contact was (and still is) Facebook. We talked over it once in June.\n\nI brought up my feelings for her with a mutual friend and he offered to set things up involving the three of us, though it didn't quite work out because of scheduling (at the time I thought she was avoiding me).\n\nTowards the end of summer (August) I decided to take one last stand as I hadn't talked to her since June and she sort of ignored one attempt I made at talking to her. Much to my surprise, she replied and we talked for a little while.\n\nNot long after that, I had to go 900 miles away for college. I began talking to her more and more, and she actually began showing me more of her attention (just liking stuff I post, I know not a big deal, but remember that she's shy).\n\nAt one point I asked for her number, which she ignored (she did the same when I asked to hang out thanksgiving week), but we continued talking and she gets pretty flirty with me a lot of the time.\n\nAt this point I feel like I've gotten as close with her as I can get, and I feel it's time I might as well get her on the same page with me.\n\nIs it a good idea to just flat out tell her how I feel and hope that she and I can start having a relationship when I go back home for a month starting a week from now?\nTL;DR:"}

It's completely normal for people here to clam up and avoid the situation when they're angry. It's what he grew up with and what everyone around him does so I don't blame him for it.\n\nI want to find a way to communicate with him more effectively. He'll discuss relationship problems with me when I bring them up, say he's okay/not angry, but then ignore me. I've seen a little improvement here-- he used to ignore me for days but lately he's been ready to talk to me again after a day or so. He doesn't get mean but he goes completely NC and if we had any plans they're assumed canceled.\n\nI grew up in an unhealthy environment too so I work hard to communicate well... I use 'I' statements, don't raise my voice or insult him, etc. So I'm frustrated that he responds this way because I'm doing the best I can. \n\nI give him space when he's ignoring me but I'm not really okay with being ignored.

How do you cope? Or if you were the passive aggressive SO, what did your partner do to help?

She has cut my hair twice now, the haircut is ok but not as good as the way Stacy would cut my hair.  I get a bob and have it stacked in the back and when Stacy did it (and did it well) I would get compliments left and right on my hair.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22M] with my ex [21F]. Why does love go away?\nPOST: Curious male here looking for different perspectives on relationships.\n\nI [M22] broke up with my gf [F21] a few months ago--we were together for a total of six months. Long story short, due to a lack of communication, little issues snowballed into big ones and our relationship went to hell--all over the course of a month. Near the end of our relationship, making plans with her was like pulling teeth and our sex life was dead and buried. We talked about things and she would agree to work on her issues (and I on mine) but she didn't really do anything. Working on it meant that I just had to sit there and deal with it.\n\nI had strong feelings for her when I ended things (and I still do) but we just couldn't keep going the way we were going. I decided to pull the trigger myself and end the relationship kind of on my own terms. She didn't take it well--even though she must have known that it was the right thing to do. Now she awkwardly avoids eye contact with me when I see her around campus.\n\nMy question for r/relationships is, why and how does love just go away? Also, why does it go away so suddenly? In my case, our relationship was full of so much passion and affection up until the last month. Over the course of a week and a half, she went from being affectionate and caring to distant and irritable.\n\nLove is a strong word and I hesitate to say it but being with her was the closest I ever felt to it. And I know that she felt the same way too--at least for a little while. Truth be told I would get back together with her but that's a different issue altogether. What could a man say or do to make that just disappear? In a relationship where we prided ourselves on being open and honest, (at least at the beginning) what would make a caring woman just back out and not care anymore. Why would she not want to work on it?\n\nObviously every woman is different and you can't read my ex's mind, but I'm just looking for some perspective from the other side. Maybe you could share some stories where you were in a similar situation? Thank you\nTL;DR:"}

I loved him, so I agreed. We met in highschool when I was 16 and he was 17 so we have been through a lot together already. I even flew out to see him a few weeks ago. \n\nHowever, things got rough. The relationship began ideally; he was a gentleman, he treated me so well, etc. Lately, over the past five months, I have been the one trying to make things work. Things were relatively okay, but I felt like I was the only one trying despite him telling me how much he loved me and how it would be okay. \n\nFast forward to now, and he has put little to no effort into the relationship at all anymore. Be it phone calls, texting, or giving him all the support I know he needed, I received nothing in return except him acknowledging that while still in love with me, he is confused and doesn't think he can do this anymore.  Knowing that I deserved better, I ended it, but it's difficult because he is my first everything and I still love him, but I know I need time to find myself and what I want.\nTL;DR:"}

Things got serious very fast and every day since I've met him has been incredible. Every day I go to bed feeling lucky to have him and I saw myself being with him forever. \n\nAbout 4 months into our relationship he suddenly broke up with me. I was so devastated that I had to miss work for a week. He wouldn't provide me with answers. The two weeks before that I could feel him drifting. It killed me. We had talked about marriage already (crazy, I know) and were completely inseparable. A few weeks later I found out he broke it off with me because he met someone else. \n\nA week after this happened, he called me and begged for me back. He was hysterical and I could tell he hated himself for what he did. I gave him another chance. Of course there were looming trust issues and insecurities but we were happy again. I got that feeling back that we were in it for the long haul. \n\nOn Friday night he told me was going out with a guy friend. I left work early to pick up his son so he could go out. An hour later I got a call saying she was looking at him eating dinner in a restaurant with another woman. \n\nBoth times this has happened, he's been caught. My confusion stems from the happiness we have at home. Our sex life is good, we love our children, (one mine, one his) and we were building a good life together. He said he will go to therapy to figure himself out because he wants to fix it. But I feel like this sort of thing happening twice is a really bad sign. But I know that the love is there. I need an outside source to tell me if I'm being a naive idiot or if its possible we can work this out. \n\nAlso, things have never gotten physical with these women.\nTL;DR:"}

So, in a way, we are each other's first serious relationship.\n\nThis doesn't really bother me, but what does is that he seemed to be a lot more publicly affectionate with other girls than he is with me. Not so much physically, he went from being unable to hold hands in public to kissing me on street corners, but in other ways.\n\nFor example, he has taken his fair share of cute pictures with his exes, as well as had loving public conversations with them on facebook (he's maintained good relationships with almost every girl he's been with, so they tend to reappear and say hello a lot, leading to the inevitable facebook stalk). I know it's immature of me, but I can't help feeling jealous that he's refused to take pictures with me and is very distant when it comes to facebook. If I bring it up, he'll post a fun video on my wall in an attempt to show he cares, but still refuses photos. So I know that he's trying, but it's still a little painful that it's so much more of an effort with me than it seems to be with them.\n\nI keep reminding myself, \"He's become more affectionate *where it matters*, so shut up,\" but there's still that little bit of hurt whenever I see him comment \"<333\" on an ex's wall post while ignoring mine.\n\nSo...am I being petty?

At first I did not think anything of it. I am used to apple devices so while I'm trying to get off of her email I see emails from an ex-boyfriend of hers she dated right after her divorce. I didn't read the email explicitly but they were recent and titled with things like \"I love you xoxo\", and some sexual things that I would honestly like to forget about.

The second arrest did not wind up on his record.  \n  \nWhen he was 22, my boyfriend was the victim of a mugging, in which he was stabbed repeatedly in the chest and hands. He cooperated with the police during the investigation. It is my understanding that cooperating with an investigation after being the victim of a violent crime may be a method for him to get a visa.  \n  \nHe is scared to initiate the process. Basically, his friends who are attorneys have told him that they think he might have a chance, but he is worried that if he talks to an actual immigration attorney and eventually gets denied, he'll basically be putting a target on his back for INS.  \n  \nBasically, I just want to know what the risks would be in my boyfriend talking to an immigration lawyer, and if someone has some idea what to expect, that would be awesome.\nTL;DR:"}

He suggested we get a two bedroom and find another couple to live with us for money saving purposes. \n\nIf he finds a job and moves to my city, this will be our first time living together, so the thought of sharing that space kinda throws me for a loop. We both don't personally know any couples who are looking for a place to live, which meant that if this happens, we could be living with a stranger couple. I don't think I could live with another couple, if we knew them or not. I suggested a couple mutual friends who we could ask to live with us if he is so hellbent on having a two bedroom for money saving purposes, but he declined them. I personally wouldn't want to hear another couple having sex in my apartment and vice versa. \n\nAm I being too negative to this suggestion? What alternatives are there? A lot of the one bedroom apartments I have seen on Kijiji are rather expensive, depending on the area.\nTL;DR:"}

We have become close quite quickly since meeting and have slept together a few times and he wants a relationship with me. I am already developing feelings for him but a number of my friends have suggested that it's a bad idea to be dating this guy because of the baby of the way.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22/M] with my friend [18/F]. She keeps flaking on plans and this time it bothered me a lot. Am I just a filler or secondary friend or is she genuinely interested in being my friend still?\nPOST: Title explains the jist of it but I'm getting frustrated. \n\nI really feel lime a filler friend. Someone to make plans with to dump at the moment something with better people comes along. I like being friends with her as I feel like our personalities line up very well, however she flakes on plans last minute almost every time. \n\nSome back story. We met in a class this January and we hit it off. We talked almost every day from then on to the end of the semester. I asked her out on a whim at one point but she said her Friend had just asked if she could set her up and that she couldn't say he's because of that. This was fine with me as I genuinely liked spending time with her even if it is just as friends. Anyways so time passes, the semester ends and I started working full time. \n\nI kept on trying to make an effort to get toget her and hang out with no luck and not many returned texts until June when she said she had time. That night was so fun I smile when I looking back at it. At the time I genuinely thought it had strengthened our friendship but now I'm not so sure. \n\nWe were supposed to get together a couple times since then but she keeps flaking at the last minute. I honestly don't understand if it is just a streak of bad luck that she keeps having to either babysit or cover for someone who calls in sick. Today was what prompted me to make this post because we had planned to go out to a movie. \n\nAbout 15 minutes before I was about to leave someone calls in sick again and she has to go to work. This is fine I mean it sucks but it happens. But I then see a couple Facebook posts and I can see she is clearly not working. Now I'm hurt and confused. I find myself questioning whether she actually wants to be friends or whether she just doesn't want to hurt me by saying she doesn't want to hang out anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

I am a 25 year old male, who recently graduated from graduate school.  I have a BS in Political Science, and a Masters of Education focusing on student success and administration in Higher Education.  My goal was to work in residential communities at a four year institution.  I have now been looking for a position in my field for over 2 years (I started before I graduated).  For the past 5 or so months I have worked as a temp Maintenance Assistant at a residential treatment facility.  Basically I do a little bit of everything; construction, demolition, clean up, painting, snow removal, grounds keeping, ect.  It's been great, its a paycheck and work at a time when I wouldn't have anything.  I have been very grateful for everything.  Today they offered me a permanent position.  It's less hours per week, but with the bump in pay raise and benefits, it works out to being paid more.  Here's the catch, its as a Janitor.  I have no problem with the position other than its not in my field at all.  Any advice would be great.  I've been on Reddit for a long time and have always loved the community and how everybody comes together.  Thanks everybody.\nTL;DR:"}

I tried to be mature with them by telling them my plan instead of doing it behind their backs like an adult. I told them that I love them but I do have my own opinion and preference and they should respect it. They tell me that it's a wrong decision, that THEY don't approve of it, that they don't raise their kids to have (implied) premarital sex, etc...They said that they don't like it even though I told them that I would be paying for the trip with my own money. \n\nFinally, they told me if they want to go then just go because they can't stop me. I thought it would be the end of the problem. I told them that I'm happy that they let me go even though they don't agree with it. Everything seemed fine until my sister told me that they're considering kicking me out of the house for not listening to them after I come back from my trip.\n\nI'm terribly hurt because I thought that I respected them enough to tell them about my plan (and my opinion that staying in the same room with your bf is OK).

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Talking about moving in, but to whose place? [m/33] [f/29]\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2+ years. This is it for us, we've talked about marriage, kids, future plans, etc. We're ready to move in together and then in a few years get married. The moving in subject is becoming more paramount and we've had very general conversations about it, but I can tell it may turn into a heated topic.\n\nHow does a couple decide who's place to move in to? I've done the pro/con list in my head about each of our places. Part of me thinks the best thing to do is just find a new place together, but (and maybe this is selfish) but my current apartment is in a great neighborhood, is very decently sized, and has private outdoor space (biggest pro for me!), and I'm paying way less than what similar places could go for. To find something even remotely comparable and affordable in NYC would be impossible. And for me one of the pros - it's not near his mother. \n\nHis current apartment he rents from his mother in a house with multiple units. She's an amazing woman whom I love to death and have a great relationship with, but even my bf complains about her being underfoot a lot of the time - nagging him about cleaning, laundry, leaving lights on. And she drops by a lot, mostly for amazing things like bringing food, or just to talk (I enjoy chatting with her, as she's more a friend than a mother-type with me). But I can foresee not having our privacy becoming an issue.\n\nThe first time I mentioned not wanting to live in his place for a list of reasons (location, commute, size, no outdoor space, mom) he got upset and defensive about me bringing up his mom. The conversation ended because he had to leave, and I haven't broached the subject again. Am I wrong for not wanting to live so close to his mother?\nTL;DR:"}

To make this short, I have good days and bad days. Every day I feel it, but some not as heavy as others. For example, my bad days mean an excruciating icepick headache that seeps pain into my face every 10 minutes, for 20 seconds. Good days mean not any real pain, just slight annoying twinges once or twice a day.\n\nMy family refers to them as headaches, which is really frustrating to me. They aren't headaches. I can't even really explain this. I'm in-between jobs right now so it's going to be really difficult for me and I need some support. I don't mean full financial support, but just understanding that I do have a rough time. I will need help here and there. I don't spend tons of money but some help would be really appreciated until I get this under control. If I can.\n\nI'm also afraid I'm going to affect my relationships. The guy I'm interested in being with might not really comprehend this fully. I don't want him to have to support me. I don't know what to do or even say about it. I won't be able to go out all the time. Sometimes I will literally have to stay in bed and watch Netflix. I can't even begin to think how to approach this subject. I'm afraid he will just leave and find a \"normal\" girlfriend.\n\nI'm just really frustrated about this. It's so hard to explain to people in my life.

Things are going well. We spend a lot of time together, share similar interests, get along well, do a lot of activities together, have a great sexual connection, etc. People always assume we are a couple because we are always together, hold hands, kiss in public, etc. Although, Matt says he likes to take his time and is not ready to make our relationship official yet. He seems confused when I bring the subject up because he says things are going well between us and that I shouldn't worry, that he likes me and cares about me a lot and that there is no other girl. Also, he never expresses his feelings towards me. When I tell him I need to hear it, he says he's not the talkative type and that he expresses his affection in other ways (ex. by spending lots of time with me, introducing me to his friends/family, doing activities together, caring about what I think or say, etc.). I'm also always a bit hesitant to bring the subject up because I don't want to be pushy.\n\nSo Reddit I need to know, am I being needy or unreasonable for wanting commitment ?

For example, today I installed a new light switch in the bathroom since the old one was corroded. It's one of those switches that you press up and down, not the \"flip\" kind. When she saw this she \"flipped\" and started ranting about how I made a stupid decision choosing this kind of switch rather than the other. How hard these kind are to clean (wtf? she doesnt clean and how can a flat switch be hard to clean?), etc. When I say rant, more like stomping around flailing her arms toward the switch and yelling at the top of her lungs. When I try to defend my decision or tell her how I'm upset that she gets upset so easily, she'll just start to laugh and tell me to get over it. At this point I'm the one who is mad and she's just standing their smiling and rolling her eyes. I don't know what this means. Is she looking down on me? Does she not respect me?

We met in a videogame (I'm not kidding) and had gotten closer and closer until we decided to start dating. I go to see her every other month and we talk in Skype literally everyday whenever we have free time.\n\nThe relationship never really gets boring because of the fact that we both love videogames so whenever we are in Skype we are enjoying  games together online and whenever we get to see each other we are both always excited since we onlg see eachother every other month.\n\nI should point out that we have both been battling depression since i was 14 and since she was 15 and while it has gotten better for both of us, especially since we met each other actually, it still is worse for her. That's not to say it is bad, just worse for her between the 2 of us\n\nA little bit of background info for both of us, she and i had similar childhoods where our parents didn't care for us very much and all of our classmates hated us, up until highschool where it got a bit better for both of us\n\nWe both have Social Anxiety\n\nWe both dislike people around us\n\nWe both are very pessimistic but realistic at the same time about things\n\nWe both hate having to spend time away from each other \n\nWe both view things in many similar ways.\n\nAnyway, I've noticed that since I started talking to her all those months ago, she never tells me what's wrong. Whether it be in person or on Skype. She begins to get quiet, look a bit down, and cry a bit.\n\nIf we are in person, she holds as much of it back and begins to say \"I'm sorry\" over and over\n\nIf we are on Skype, she will usually turn the cam off and mute her mic when she can't hold it back anymore.\n\nShe has told me what was wrong a few times but a majority of the time she doesn't say.\n\nI don't think this is a trust issue also, just to get that out of the way.\nTL;DR:"}

Well now that I know more about her, she is driving me mad. I want to take her on a date, but she is caught up with her douche boyfriend. He is, in all aspects, a douche.

Which brings me to my dilemma: I ran into her today and she invited my sister and I over for dinner. As dinner got closer, she told my sister to come over but for me to wait until my sister texted me to come over. Later my sister texted me and told me they are talking about her boyfriend.

I say that he needs to set some goals so we can make a plan to reach them together.  He says this is an American obsession with \"reaching your potential\" and doesn't want to do it.  He says, in Latin America, you just do what you do - you don't have big \"goals\" and plans to \"achieve\" them.\n\nI find this frustrating and could use some advice from others who have been in a situation like this on how to navigate.\n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

Things seemed awesome, we talked a lot for a week and worked hard to get to know eachother and then eventually went on an amazing date the following week.  He kept trying to prolong it, take me to do different activities, and even remembered how i liked my coffee when he ordered for me. He even suggested a possibly date the next day (but it was weather permitting-and unfortunately weather did not permit)\n\nSo we talked again after that for a few more days, and on thursday, i asked if he was free at all this weekend.  i told him i had work til 8 friday night and i knew he was off of work at 3.  I didn't hear from him friday so i tried texting him just asking if we were still good and called him once an hour later (my texting on my phone has been known to fail once in a while).  I didn't hear from him until the next day when he sent a text saying he was sorry and he fell asleep and he didn't wake up until three.\n\nSo I guess I'm a little confused and in denial.  It was rude how he blew me off, but it seemed like he liked me a lot so i don't really understand.  is there something i'm missing here, could someone cue me in as to what he was thinking?\nTL;DR:"}

My family and I doesn't care when our other neighbors have a fire once in a while with their friends but these neighbors are just bad. \n\nMy mother is a cancer survivor and is bothered very much by smoke. This smoke that comes from their pit fills the entire house with smoke and forces us to shut every window in the house for hours while they have this fire going. It closes off all the fresh air and makes us sit in the hot, nasty air while we sleep. \n\nMy parents called the cops a few times, but they never actually got fined and in result never stopped making the fires. Last night, my folks called again and the cop fined the neighbors because there was a smog warning. An hour later one of the neighbors came and smashed an egg on our front door. They didn't throw it, they walked up to the door and smashed it. \n\nWe've gotten really fed up with this attitude and highly doubt that the police will care about what happens at all, so I would like to get back at them in some non-violent and passive way to show them how annoying it can be.

We get along well, have an active sex life, and spend a good amount of time together. However, I've been thinking more recently about sleeping with other women. There's nothing wrong with our sex life, it's actually pretty perfect, but I still have the desire to sleep with other women.\n\nI have no interest in cheating on my girlfriend, or breaking up with her because I want to sleep with other women, so I began thinking about an open relationship. I know I am good at compartmentalizing sex and emotions, and while I'd be true to my girlfriend emotionally, I'd be able to have sex with other women, and she with other men. I know that we'd have to set strict guidelines on completely open and honest communication, and being able to stop if either of us got uncomfortable.\n\nThe problem with this is I think she'll take it horribly. I think she'll think that I do not find her attractive, am not satisfied with her or our relationship, or I want to cheat on here \u2013 none of which are true.\n\nI've also been thinking that I will have a hard time down the line having sex with one woman forever.

My way of dealing when I'm feeling really low is asking for her support. Just talking or spending time together will completely change my mood. But in her case, it's different. she pushes away, locks me out. She says she doesn't want my support but i see her struggling and i can't do anything. These past few days she's been pushing away a lot more and she won't text me. We don't live together so i just can't know what the fuck she's going through so i imagine the worse. Im at home, feeling hopeless and powerless to help her. And when this usually happens i blow up and i force my way in and of course thats not good. she gets angry and threatens to leave me because i can't give her space. But what would she have me do??

We were in the club with few of her friends and eventually after some booze and music we started dancing and the classic teasing started, and I, like most men I think, loose any common sense and start bein' like a dog \"attacking\" for a kiss, but it doesn't happen, only teasing, dancing, somekind of touching. I usually refer to myself as an alpha male but I manage to turn into a small baby when this happens. I got irritated by declining and eventually moved away a bit as she resumed to dance with another guy who was in the group - she was \"improoving his mood\" as his ex was there and he was kinda sad, so ok. The night ended regualrly we went to eat and I paid for her cab. I haven't heard much of since then just she told that it was great bla bla. I'm not really looking for a some big relationship at the moment as I think that she has a boyfriend (but I don't think its some strong relationship as she acted like she did), I'd want to make it an adventure or eventually a friends with benefits situation.

I am sure you have read a million posts like this and will say I am an idiot, but I could care less, if you don't like it then down vote, anyway..\n\nHere is my situation: I am a 20 year old college student from a rural town going to college in a big city. I have always  had a really good group of friends, and I have always had a crush on one of my friends (She is actually my best Friends sister, but I'll get to that later.) Anyway this girl, is amazing, she is smart, athletic, funny, caring, and the nicest person you'd ever meet, and I promise I  am not just saying that because of how I feel. So she is awesome, and over the last two years we have gotten extremely close, the problem had always been that she has had a boyfriend. The boyfriend turned out to be a cheating asshole and now she is single. Which I have been ecstatic about, but that obviously doesn't automatically bring us together. At the time of her last relationship while we were getting close we got into this weird friendship where it seemed like we wanted to date each other but never did. We have never really talked about our feelings for each other outside of friendship and honestly I am terrified of bringing it up. \nSo basically my question is what should I do? I don't want to ruin this friendship, but I don't think I can deal with just being friends, eventually being the girls shoulder to cry on becomes too much. In addition I don't want to screw up and become a rebound after her last long term relationship. Honestly I may be fooling myself, and she may see me as nothing but a friend and always has, I just don't know. Her brother, my best friend, says that I am being a pussy and that if it wasn't for the other guy we would have already been together.\nTL;DR:"}

By the way, this guys married. I've noticed her texting him a lot, with him venting about problems with his marriage and what not. Well today she was making food and I was in the living room when her phone lit up with a text from him saying something along the lines of \"So what panties are you wearing tonight? ;)\" I brought it up with her and it ended up being an argument which resulted in her saying \"Look, every guy flirts with every girl. It happens.\" I don't think I'm perfect but I've never flirted intentionally since I've been with her. Its very wrong to me (been cheated on in the past, family history is filled with cheating, etc). \n\nI should mention that a few months back a mutual guy friend of ours said she had been flirting with his roommate. And that recently, an ex-bf has come into the picture. Which doesn't bother me that much, its just a lot to handle at once after such a shaky month. \n\nBack to the married douche, what should I do/say? It seems like she's just attracting guy friends that will shower her with attention, something I feel like I give plenty of. There's no question of that. I really don't want to come out and say \"If he flirts with you again, tell him to quit it or we're done\", seems a bit extreme. Any help or advice is much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by drinking the wrong bottle\nPOST: In my recent TIFU I said I was an extremely idiotic person, and after seeing the TIFU of me locking myself out of my own house go pretty well I thought I'd tell you redditors another of my most stupid TIFU's (I have a couple of them stored for some other time).\n\nSo this TIFU is a fairly basic one - I was at a house party, and because me and my friends all decided that I was to be the sober one in the group I could not get drunk at all. Here's where I fail at that. On the table holding all the drinks were a couple of bottles, including about 3 that looked like water bottles. Well they were water bottles, but inside them was vodka. Pure vodka. After finishing 1 I was feeling pretty tipsy, and I am very lightweight, so my condition was worsening throughout the party and I was walking into walls, walking into people and saying things I didn't even remember. Apparently I tried to unbutton a girls shirt and said \"let me see your pocket full of treasure\" while doing so. It was fair to say I never talked to her again. \n\nNow I look back at it, I should have known that there was vodka in those water bottles - I even told myself I should have brought my own drinks, but the person who held the party assured me that there would be drinks containing no alcohol whatsoever.\n\nEnd of the party I had drank 1 whole bottle and half or a quarter of another and the person who held the party let me stay over. My friends were pretty pissed off as I ended up being most drunkest compared to all my friends when I was supposed to be sober.\n\nFor those wondering; in my group we always have a sober one at a party, so if someone get's so drunk the sober person brings him/her home and tell the parents of them that they were feeling sick or hit their head, or if they were living in their own flat we would place them in their bed with a bucket next to them.\nTL;DR:"}

Anything constructive would be very appreciated. \n\nSo I met this girl [18] 3 months ago at a night club in Manchester, England, we've been dating since then. A few weeks ago I let it slip that a loved her, I've never truly loved a girl before so I didn't know what to expect. She responded with \"I love you too\" and things could not be better. \n\nLast week I started a conversation about sex. How can I improve, what does she like, what doesn't she like. Generic stuff. But it was evident she was not comfortable talking about this stuff, she doesn't even talk about it with her friends. I've asked her sex related questions before but nothing quite in depth.\n\nAnd ever since then I feel like she's been off with me, she's less responsive with texts doesn't want to see me on the weekends.\n \n\nI tried my best to make amends today by asking if everything is ok, and she kept responding with \"it's hard\" or \"i'm confused\". I've not been on the long term relationship scene ever. So I don't what to think. \n\nShe keeps saying stuff like \"I don't want to upset you\" or \"I feel like I don't give you the time you deserve\". She's hopefully going into uni next year or joining the fire service this year so she's naturally worrying about her time with me. \n\nShe also said she's not liking that she's \"growing up\" she feels like a kid at heart and doesn't want to change that. \n\nShe still says that she loves me and wants to be with me but she needs to think about everything and get over it what she is currently thinking. \n\nMy view on it is that she sees me and someone that only wants sex and doesn't care for her other social needs, that should be the only one in her life, which completely untrue.\n\nI don't know what to do I feel depressed and lonely and the thought of me without her deeply saddens me.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't like it when she harms herself and I feel extremely annoyed by that. She feels bad because she has not finished her studies yet and this is her reason of these vices. She was also depressed for quite some time now because of a combination of all the above and she takes meds. \n\nI feel it would be easy for me to find another woman without these issues and now we don't have yet children. On the other hand we have been together for so long and I trust her deeply and I care about her.

He needed a parking pass and knew I was done with mine for the summer so I went to go get mine from the car to give to him. In the small sliver of time (2-3 minutes), the girl came in and went into our bathroom to change. We had some work done on our bathroom and I wanted to see how good it looked so I went to go check it out as soon as I came back in... without knowing she was in there getting ready for the pool. Immediately I flinched away and said sorry, and she just laughed and covered herself up.

Was told today that Cluster > Organization\nPOST: I just recently started a job, which is more of an assistance/paperwork type watch position more than anything else, although this position alone provides a lot of support for our company and is highly visible. I'm still learning the job and realized that the position is very unorganized when it came to simple things. We get probably easily 50-100 emails a day, each email providing a specific input for one of our responsibilities and eventually it completely fills up the mailbox. As an proposal by myself and acceptable of half the personnel who work that particular position, I have completely organized it and created automation rules so when a particular email comes in, it goes to a specific folder and you can be like \"Oh hey. I got a BLUE (1) next to this folder, it must mean that I got someone's input in regards to this task\". \n\nWell today. I had a older lady tell me that \"my idea\" didn't work because she was a firm believer that no one would check these folders and deleted all of them, right in front of me. She basically told me in the lamest terms that \"Organization is not the key to success because we are an older group of people who don't like change\". So we immediately went from simple organization to going back to a clusterfuck. For me being the new guy, I just put a smile on and just nod my head. Although deep down inside, I'm just angry. \n\nWe work for one of those companies where change is influenced by the leadership as long as it is going to improve whatever it is affecting.

We lived together for over half of this time and always got along great and had fun together. We loved going hiking and going away together for the weekend and things like that. The past 6 months we were both busy and neglected our relationship and it turned into more of a friendship I guess. I broke up with her 2 months ago because I felt like I was possibly missing out on a lot of things, dating other girls and having more freedom. She was only my second girlfriend and by far my longest relationship.\n\nShe didn't take it well and it was really hard to do\u2026 we never fight and it was completely out of the blue but I just panicked when I thought about the next few years and committing really long-term to her.\n\nWe've barely talked over the past 2 months at my request but I'm starting to genuinely regret my decision.

Here is an example in the past day or so that has caused me to be confused and feel as if I needed to post to this subreddit.\n\nFirst-- I am in college, and my bf and I both live in a dorm. Now, we both have discussed our desire to get married to each other. So, I am about a 10 min walk away from our dorm, when I realize that I forgot my calculator for an exam that was in the next hour. I had been hoping to study for this exam, and forgetting the calculator meant that instead I would have to spend the 30 mins walking to go get it instead of being able to study. I texted my bf asking him to bring it to me, but he didn't answer for a while, so I just walked back. I realize he probably was not maliciously ignoring my texts, but I know that there was no chance he would have brought me my calculator if it meant a 20 min walk for him. This is a situation where we have actually been in the exact opposite, and he forgot his calculator, and I offered to run to him with it.\n\nI realize that part of it is his pride-- while I ask for him to bring me my calculator, and he doesn't, he would never ask it of me, and I offer it.\n\nWhen he doesn't bring it to me, I get snippy. I realize this is probably not the most mature response, but it's the fact that I don't feel like the relationship is equal if he does not feel willing to do the things that I feel willing to do.\n\nWhat do you think?

He had a huge crush on one girl in middle school and on into high school but I don't think it was ever properly resolved and they've remained friends... Whenever he talks to her I feel extremely jealous, and when he hangs out with her I am angry that he is doing things I would have liked to have done with him with her instead. It's damaging to my self esteem because I love him and nobody else, but when I think about their relationship (childhood friends who remained in contact over the years despite moving apart from each other) I feel like if it were a movie they'd end up together and I'd be without the man I love... I don't know if I should ask him to affirm that he doesn't have feelings for her (what if he still does? I don't know that I can handle that can of worms) and I don't want to tell him to stop hanging out with one of his few good friends... I only have to deal with it a couple of times a year, but I still have difficulty sorting through the feelings and it's affecting my performance as a person.\nTL;DR:"}

I have known said friend/coworker for a little over a year, but she just started working in the same department as me (we work at the childcare facility at a gym).\n\n The other night she called me while intoxicated and left a voicemail, one that I did not listen to because she asked me to not do so. I found out what it said tonight at work when I asked her about it, she told me that it was a butt-dial, but a third party present at the time told me it was, and I quote \"Not a butt dial\". Upon further questioning she told me that the voicemail said, in her words, \" Third party from earlier wants to know if you're Jewish and also I think your face is pretty and I love you bye\". I'd like to say that I responded with something clever or funny or whatever, but in reality I just said nothing, and quickly left the room saying I had to go to the bathroom.\n\nMy brother (16m) told me that she liked me upon seeing an interaction and based his opinion on her body language and general behavior, and to tell the truth I can't tell. I'd like to say that I am some suave ladies man, but the truth is I have never held a girls hand. Touched a boob with my elbow once, bu that was an accident. please give advice and tell me if you think that she was just saying that or if she might mean it.\nTL;DR:"}

We talked during the first week of college and he admitted that he irrationally thought that I wanted a relationship, and that he was sorry for distancing himself. He admitted that he was afraid of commitment due to his last serious relationship that turned sour. I told him that I wasn't necessarily looking for commitment, and we could have fun, see where things led us -- and if a relationship came out of it all, well that would just be a bonus. \n\nSince having that conversation, he has taken me out on dates, to parties, and greets me with a kiss when we see each other. He kisses me in public, in front of his friends. He has invited me over to his house, where I have met his parents and dined with them. \n\nWe have been seeing each other for three weeks now, and have fooled around, cuddled, and had sex. I guess I'm just confused because it seemed to me as though we had a sort FWB arrangement, but from the start he has been really affectionate, and hasn't been afraid to show his affection in public. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mind this affection. But I'm getting to a point where I would like to know where we stand. Then again, I'm hesitant to ask if we're exclusive since he made a point of telling me that he is afraid of commitment and I really don't want to mess up what we have now. I really like what I have with him now, and don't want to mess it up just so that I can have a definitive label on what we are...\n\nThoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [20 F] with my SO [21 M] 4 years, is it wrong for me to be upset that he doesn't work?\nPOST: As the title suggests, we've been going out 4 years since high school, he was a senior, I'm one year younger. I've worked pretty much the entirety of our relationship, he worked for 4 months the summer after his first year of uni as his parents encouraged his cousin to hire him. \n\nWe're both in uni now, I in my 3rd year, he in his 4th. I've always paid for the majority of things, never minding much since I was constantly working and understood he wanted to focus on school. He's in engineering, and the load is quite heavy. However, this year I decided to quit because my savings allowed it and wanted to focus primarily on school since my marks were beginning to suffer. I think my quitting and talk of how stressful it was to work during school scared him into never finding a job during school, despite the fact that his schedule this year would allow it. \n\nHe often claims he doesn't have enough time to focus on two things at once, while always having time to play video games or going through marathons of shows on netflix. Since I'm no longer working, I've put an effort into carefully spending the savings I have until I work again in the fall. Lately our time together has been spent either marathoning shows or just laying down and watching TV. I miss going out and doing things, but if I don't want to watch tv, then I have to put a concious effort into either planning something that doesn't involve spending money OR put up the money to spend. His money comes from his mom who rations out $100 at a time to him. I knew that when I quit my job, we would have to stop going out, but it's really highlighted the fact that I'm always the one who has to put in effort (whehter its in planning, or paying) if we're gonna do something that sitting at one of our houses doing nothing. Am I wrong to be upset about this?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 20 (soon to be 21 in 9 days) and while I've always been a hardcore romantic, dating lately feels too \"heavy\" for me.\n\nFor starters, my mindset changed since I started solo traveling this past year. I did two separate trips (one in December and one this past July) and while the sights and people I met along my adventures were unforgettable, one thing that I began to realize especially after my recent trip is how freeing ones independence can be and also that I have SO much life to live and experience! \n\nThe guy who this post is about has been chasing me for a year and only in the past two months have I actually started talking to him and realized that he's a *really* sweet and genuine guy. We went on our first date yesterday and while it was great (ended up being a 6hr date) and we seem to have chemistry, there were parts where I just felt overwhelmed by it all. Like when he mentioned that he told his mom all about me or when he talked about how cute a pair of baby clothes were, it was like I internally felt.. smothered.\n\nSo now I don't know what to do? One one hand I like him and he's a great guy but on the other I feel like I'm just too young for heavy commitments. What would you do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [19M] girlfriend [17F] of 11 months seems to resent all of my personal interests/hobbies, is something wrong?\nPOST: I've been noticing something about my girlfriend in recent months of our relationship. Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely in love with this girl. I've been with her for this long for this very reason. This is just something that's been on my mind for a while now, and I've finally decided to ask for some advice.\n\nMy girlfriend tends to resent my personal interests such as movies, music etc. and I'm not sure what to think of it. It's weird to me because I seem to be into a lot of things she's into, but it's the complete opposite with her to me. Not to mention that sometimes her opinions of my taste seem to come off as overly harsh.\n\nA recent example of this would be in music. I recently introduced her to my all time favorite band. I figured she would like them since they're very similar to what she listens to. Instead I get answers like \"they're okay, just generic\" and such. This is the answer I get with a lot of things I try to introduce to her. I get the answer with movies, TV shows, music, food, and pretty much everything.\n\nI love her very much, but I feel like I'm the only one that's enthusiastic about exploring each other's interests. When she wants to introduce me to something of her interest, she get's really excited and enthusiastic, but when I want to do the same, she seems a bit irritated. I personally think she feels I'm trying to change who she is, when I'm only wanting us to explore each others worlds. She loves it when I explore her interests, but seems frustrated when I recommend some of mine.\n\nWhat I also find weird is that she sometimes claims to not have any real hobbies or interests. I figured a thought process like this could have something to do with this situation.\n\nIs this a big issue? Should I be worried? I'm constantly afraid that something like this could destroy our relationship, and I don't want that.\nTL;DR:"}

She was so drunk that she couldn't even orgasm, which led her to her getting pissed off at me and refusing to talk to me until she passed out.  This ultimately led to us breaking up in March, because after this situation I wasn't attracted to her anymore, physically or emotionally.  A week after we broke up, I took a friend on a date, and my ex found out flipped out on me, and accused me of cheating on her.  Even over a month later, she tells all her friends & coworkers (which are mine, too, we work at the same hospital) that I cheated on her, and is constantly telling them things about me that are private.  Not a lot of people like me at work, so I don't get the chance to give my side of the story, and even if I did, no one would want to hear it, and if they did, no one would believe me.

I don't really have a question, I just want to vent my frustration for a sec.\nPOST: My friend and coworker (25f) snuck out of work 4 hours early today and will still get paid for the time she wasn't there. The only people who know are me and another new coworker who works closely with her. After I was out of work, I texted her to say I hope the new coworker is trustworthy. (Personally, I don't trust him--or at least I wouldn't trust him with that much dirt on me.) This guy told me directly that he wasn't going to rat her out to the boss, but he also added something like, \"if she wants to get fired that's her own business, I won't get involved.\" \n\nSo basically I got the point across to my friend that this guy said he'd keep his mouth shut, but I still didn't think it was smart to trust him. Well, my friend had a minor flip-out at me for stressing her out with this kind of stuff at work when she just wanted to enjoy the rest of her day. I told her I just don't want to see her get in trouble. (And I really don't. Even though she can be kind of a dbag, she means a lot to me and the fact that she's there at work is probably the best part of the job.) Anyway her response to that was, \"How about I just enjoy the rest of my day without hearing any of this bullshit. How about that? Thanks!\"\n\nUghhh. I mean, I guess I could have just held my tongue but the way I see it, if she didn't want to be nervous about getting in trouble, then she shouldn't have done something that could get her in trouble. Whatever man. Just needed to vent. No need to call my friend any names. There's more to her than this. \n\n**Well, I guess I do have a question: Am I right to think my friend is being a dbag or was I wrong to sort of lecture/judge her in an indirect way?\nTL;DR:"}

While he absolutely helped me improve myself and my life, he went about it by emotionally manipulating me. For example, when we started dating, I knew little about musical artists. Whenever a song came on- didn't matter where or when or in front of who- he'd stop everything and ask me who the artist was. If I got it wrong, he'd publicly shame me and get legitimately angry. That's just one small example, but he was always an inch away from being angry, and it had me walking on eggshells for the last 4 years.\n\nWhen we started dating, I was fun and happy, full of energy, optimistic. Those positive traits were slowly stomped down, and now I feel like a shell of my former self. I used to look for adventures and new friends, now everything and everyone seems scary. He lived life like the world was out to get him, and he had to be ready to fight at any moment. Now I live that way, too, except I don't want to fight, I'm just terrified.\n\nMy friends have been trying to be there for me, but my negative energy is bringing them down.

We fell in love and agreed to date, even though we're a 2.5 hour drive away from each other. It worked well for a little while - we love all the same things, share the same political views, we're good at splitting the bill, call/text each other every day, and visit every other weekend.

I save money, jump on career opportunities, plan for the future, and I'm trying to get my own apartment. Unfortunately, despite being the sweetest guy ever, he has not really changed since I met him: his poor money habits scare the crap out of me, he doesn't plan anything out, and after changing his major *again* he still has 1 more year of school. He IS doing much better in school now, but his GPA from before was pretty low, and he still hasn't gotten an internship or joined a student group in order to make up for that (he \"tries\" but has never followed through).\n\nI've felt like a nagging mother lately, which is unhealthy, exhausting, and discouraging. I'm ready for an adult relationship, but he acts like a teenager when it comes to real-life scenarios. I love him so much, and his personality makes me happy... but it sucks having to carry ALL the adult burdens. On top of that, I wonder if giving up my weekends for him is causing me to neglect my own life (missing out on social things, not getting a dog like I wanted to, not joining groups/clubs, etc.).\n\nIs love enough, and I'm just being selfish?

She is a fantastic, smart, and fun individual, but for some reason my brain (dare I say heart) seems to always tell me that I cannot trust her, which is awful. Because I really want to trust her! And she has been absolutely fantastic and understanding to me when I explained how I've been feeling with her. ANYHOW now that I've basically explained my issue, here is my question.\n\nHow do I begin trusting people again? I feel like it's been beyond long enough that I shouldn't have to feel like this, and I really like where my new relationship is headed, but I hate second guessing who I put my trust in.\nTL;DR:"}

He is the most amazing human being I have ever met, an awesome father to our son, he supports me and my career in every way and generally goes above and beyond to make me happy. But... I just do not feel attracted to him anymore, and haven't for a while. It is not that I am not interested in sex at all - I do fantasize about sex with other men quite a lot, particularly about one of my coworkers (who I think is also into me).\n\nI make myself have sex with my husband about once a week, because I know he wants me (he would probably want to have sex every day). I mostly do this by fantasizing about sleeping with somebody else, mostly that one coworker. My husband of course does not know this.\n\nI do not want our relationship to end, because I love him and he is perfect in every other way. I've thought fleetingly about having an affair, but I do not want to hurt him, or lie to him.\n\nSo where do I go from here? Is there any way I can get some of the initial passion back? I feel kind of desperate that I only had 2 years of passionate sex as a teenager, and am now doomed to a lifetime of routine, make-myself-do-it, pretend-to-enjoy-it sex.\nTL;DR:"}

Me and my GF have been dating for 5 months (today makes 5 months). I have been going through some tough times and she really helped me get through them. \n\nSo onto the problem. So I have always been the one to make plans and I was fine with it at first. But lately it started to bother me so I told her that I'd like her to make plans more often. The reason it bothers me isn't really just because I have to make the plans but because she has to cancel on them constantly. She says she's busy which I know she is, balancing school, work, and volunteering. But all I'm asking for is to see her 1 or 2 times a week. I dont feel like that is unreasonable. I haven't seen her in 2 weeks as of today. \n\nAnother issue is that communication has gone downhill. we barely talk anymore, she just ceases to answer after a while. She says its because shes busy. While lurking on this subreddit I saw the general consensus in this situation is to back off and see if she will make contact first. It's been 2 days (todays the 3rd) and she hasn't. So /r/relationships... has she lost interest, am I reading too much into this, or is it something else entirely.\nTL;DR:"}

[NSFW]\nPOST: Hello ladies and gentlemen,\n\nI've been in a LTR with my lovely girlfriend \"rita\" for about 3 years now. The beginning of our relationship, we were very passionate. We loved pleasing each other sexually and emotionally - it was a selfless love. We don't live together, but we both planned on moving in with each other in the near future. I currently live in my own apartment and she's over 80-90% of the time. \n\nI was never much into male/female roles in a relationship - I've always believed that cooking/cleaning is just shit that everybody needs to do. Recently, I've been doing all of the dishes whether it's my mess, her mess, or both of our mess. Every time I ask or tell her to the dishes she always passive aggressively guilts me by telling me that \"i am too controlling.\" (She comes from a household of feminist extremists). She never cooks me for, i'm always cooking for her now-a-days. Although she's not that great of a cook, there was always an effort before. \n\nThe other day she was reading an article written by a woman on why \"you should go down on your partner.\" Rita was completely mortified and was spewing stuff like \"that's so degrading!\" \"i would never swallow your spunk!\" \"this was written by a dude!\" \"It's such a hassle sucking you\". I felt hurt, I was always under the impression that she enjoyed pleasing me; that it was a mutual exchange. I had no idea it was a \"chore\" to her\n\nInstantly I felt like I was completely unattracted to her. It got quiet, and I told her to leave - I began questioning my future with her. For some reason, everything that's been going on with her ordeal with \"cooking, cleaning, oral sex.\" is really pushing me away from her. \n\nI'm sorry if this sounds shallow or sexist - but it's how I feel at the moment. Please guys and gals - help me out here!\nTL;DR:"}

In the later years we all tended to avoid talking about it. Every discussion about her increasingly incoherent and sometimes violent behavior was awkward, so we just didn't talk about it much after a while.\n\nTo me she died years ago, as she stopped being who she was in any meaningful way at least five years ago. When she finally passed, I wasn't sure how everyone would react, so I kept quiet and waited for everyone else to set the tone.\n\nI discovered later that my father now resents me for not expressing condolences to him and others in the way he expected. When I explained to him that I'd already grieved and moved on long before she died, that I suspected others in the family had too, and I was waiting for others to set the tone to tell me how they wanted to grieve, he got offended.\n\nHe explicitly said I should have made a bunch of phone calls, sent cards, and all sorts of other platitudes which to me are empty gestures. He said I should do it anyway even if it would've been meaningless to me.\n\nSaying something like that reeks of emotional bullying to me. Everyone grieves differently. There is no right way to do it and he shouldn't be trying to shame me for feeling more relieved than grief-stricken now that this slow, painful, arduous dementia death spiral has finally come to an end.\n\nI feel like I can't possibly be the first person to experience a vast disparity in grief response, or family shaming for grieving differently. There's got to be some helpful article out there basically saying \"don't shame people for not being as upset as you\" or \"don't shame people for not grieving with the same rituals\" or something like that, but my Googling isn't turning up much.\n\nWhat can I tell him to deescalate this without caving to the bullying and pretending to grieve his way?\nTL;DR:"}

What should I do?\nPOST: Hi! I'm really glad I found this subbreddit because I'm trying to solve a problem I've been having for a long time, and I'm hoping to find some advice. There are a million details I could talk about, but I think I'm going to keep this post fairly down to the point. \n\nI've been with my boyfriend for 2.5 years now. I've become extremely dependent on him - I rely on him to drive me to work and school because I don't drive, and there is no public transit available in our neighborhood. We are also very financially bound, as we recently bought a house together, and he owes me a large amount of money (which he pays me monthly). He has asked me about marriage multiple times. \n\nWe've had a lot of ups and downs in our relationship. Sometimes I can imaging staying with him for life - but other times I really wish I could break up and move on. I've had thoughts of breaking up with him on and off during the entire duration of our relationship - I have quite a strong internal battle over this. He has asked me about marriage multiple times, but I absolutely won't let myself marry him because I'm terribly afraid that I would regret it. I didn't have much experience with relationships prior to this one, so I don't have much to compare this to. I feel like I need to meet more people and explore life a little more.  **I just can't help but wonder if I could find someone better - someone more attractive and ambitious - I think this is my biggest problem.** But then, I worry that I might regret leaving him. We've done a lot of great things together, and he is definitely my best friend. \n\nIs it normal to have thoughts like these? Should I seriously start planning to break up with him?\nTL;DR:"}

How to solve issues before next time?\nPOST: I met this girl around January, we went on a couple dates and it was just magic. About 3 months in we started to let our guard down more and show each other our true selves. We both had personal baggage that kept interfering and fights have been more and more frequent since. It has become clear recently that for this relationship to work we both need to make major changes in ourselves. She has made it pretty clear that she's not willing to, and the changes I have tried to make seem to go unnoticed.\n\nA couple days ago she asked for \"space to think\". Given how she is I'm pretty sure this is her way of beginning the break up process. I know it's going to be heartbreaking, but I'm trying to work on coming to accept it (I'm not going to beg someone to be in a relationship with me if they don't want it). What my question is, how do I move on from here to work on my own issues, so that they don't rear up the next time I'm in a relationship?\n\nMost of my issues stem from jealousy. My previous girlfriend who I had been dating for 5 years cheated on me for the last 6 months of our relationship. I had never been jealous with her, never suspected anything, the thought never crossed my mind. I thought it hadn't effected me much, but when I started falling in love with this girlfriend, I found myself full of anxiety about it, constantly worrying about it, due to my previous relationship, and her lengthy sexual past. This led to my being a crazy, controlling asshole, hence part of the reason I've driven her away.\n\nMy question is, how do you work on it? How do you learn to trust again, how do you get rid of this anxiety? I'm not planning on dating again quickly, but I don't want this to plague me all my life.\nTL;DR:"}

I understand that the owner will only be getting bad news but I honestly thought they would rather know.\nSo after this experience I decided to have a pint at my local. I arrived there and had my hand shaken by numerous people who had been told of my exploits and wanted to thank me.

Is there a better system?\nPOST: In recent years I've been coming to the conclusion that the whole concept of money is ridiculous. The idea that whole countries could be in debt seems bizarre somehow. I have some understanding of quantitative easing, and why simply printing money can have many negative effects. But ultimately, we invented money and have the power to create more... how can we run out? New money has to be made anyway, if you imagine the amount that is destroyed; set on fire, put in the washer etc. Or maybe just in a forgotten bank account. It adds up, and it's taken out of circulation, and not spent in a shop who in turn pays staff and so on. Taking in to account the increasing population, that means there is even less to go around.

It's unity.  For a meal it's the unity of the flavors and textures coming together.  For art it's the colors and brush strokes.  For sound it's the beat, rhythm, and instruments coming together to form a symphony.  The most famous Jewish prayer is the Sh'ma.  The Sh'ma reads: \"Hear, O Israel: the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.\"  This does not mean there is one G-d, this means that G-d is one, or oneness.  In other words, G-d is unity.  G-d, the Rabbi said, is not a man in the sky with a great white beard, he is everything around us that is beautiful.  Because we all search for pleasure and pleasure is unity and unity is G-d, we all search for G-d and there is no such thing as a true atheist.\nTL;DR:"}

I transferred colleges this year so now that i live at home we are very close to eachother. We talk more now. My problem is that she plays unbelievable hard to get head games IMO. for example we will set a date to get together and I will look forward to it all week and then she always tells me the day of that something came up. after last weekend I really was upset being the 5th or so time this has happened. So a couple days ago I texted her that Ive had enough of her games and that she should call me when she REALLY wants to go out. she flipped out about it and i did not reply for a whole day. the issue is that I folded the day after and told her that I apologize and that I care for her very much. What do I do? I know that this isnt healthy and I should cut her off but I find it very hard due to the fact that I care for her so much.\nTL;DR:"}

I did it, and it felt **amazing**, seeing that $1,000 in my savings account every time I checked my bank account online.\n\nHowever, I keep seeming to chip away at it for non-emergency items.\n\nMainly it was due to having a debit card; I seem to have no control with it. So I cut it up and will be moving to use the envelope system. However, I took pictures of my debit card for online purchases (can't use cash on Amazon or certain other websites I use to buy stuff...). And I'm still chipping away at my emergency fund by going to the bank physically and transferring money to my checking account to spend online.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. Now, I live with my mom (decided to go back to school and finish my degree so I moved back home, great opportunity for me), and she said she's willing to hold on to my emergency fund for me so I can't spend it. Should I do that? Or should I learn to keep money in my savings, somehow? Or should I get my emergency fund in cash and put it in a glass frame in my closet or something? I am down to $600 already and plan to get back up to $1,000 by dumping my paycheck this Thursday into it, but I am worried this process will continue.\nTL;DR:"}

My reason to break up was simply because I wasn't happy with her. We didn't argue that often so it wasn't like a toxic relationship.\n\nThe thing is, she was my first girlfriend. I loved her when we broke up, and I still love her now, but I know we weren't right for each other, so I decided to break up with her at the start of summer so we'd have time to get over the relationship before our third year of university started. I didn't want to break up at the start of term and have the situation mess up our last (and most important) year of university.\n\nabout half way through summer, I found out she's been acting very out of character since the break up and has been sleeping around a lot which is **completely** out of character for her. She's been saying some weird things and copying other peoples strange opinions. The thoughts of her going home with random guys she meets in clubs and from the internet worries me. I don't want someone to hurt her.\n\nIn regards to the sleeping around, If she was like this before our relationship I wouldn't think much of it, but she never even used to even kiss people in clubs before me (and prior to her ex-ex-boyfriends.) \n\nIt's been about a month since term has started and she's made it clear to me she's moved on from the few times we've spoken. This is why I don't understand why she ignores me and gets so visibly uncomfortable around me. I genuinely want her to be happy in university and life, but all she's done has been nasty and disrespectful to me (example, getting involved with one of my old friends).\nTL;DR:"}

I don't really handle stressful or emotionally-alien situations too well, so when she told me that, I kinda got all quiet and introvert-y (as I usually do when confronted with these emotional and personal situations). She then told me that I shouldn't take it so seriously, and if I'm going to react like this, she won't be coming to me for emotional advice all too often. Kinda feel like I screwed up on this one. We usually get along, no fights or anything, so the whole conversation was strange; the rest of the evening got really awkward, for that matter.\n\nThis morning I apologized for my reaction (or lack of reaction, for that matter), and she said that I can be really difficult to deal with when I act like that. Kinda feel like I screwed up. Any advice on how I should proceed from here? Like, I'm perfectly okay with them hanging out and being close friends and everything...

I possibly hit my head on the way down and it may possibly have been a mini seizure, which I have been undiagnosed with. I lost my insurance a week prior to this, so my ER visit obviously racked up a large bill. My boyfriend was there during the incident, and drove me to the hospital, and has spent the subsequent weeks stressing about my insurance and not being able to financially afford the bill (on top of my other medical debt). I recently started making more money at work, so I no longer qualify for state insurance, but I also barely make above the cutoff and can't really afford any other insurance. \n\nHe has been stressing about this so much that he has been talking to other people about what happened, like his mom, and his older sister, causing them to worry about me. But last night he went out alone with a girl whom I have a history of problems with and blabbed everything to her, as well. I have a huge problem with them even seeing each other, and then to hear that he's telling her my personal health information and asking her for advice on what kind of insurance I should get (the girl and I share a company employer but don't work together, thankfully) just made me really upset. He thinks I'm being ridiculous saying that it was something that happened to him, as well, and doesn't think it's a big deal that he told her, since he's told family and friends (that I actually like and trust) and I had no problem with it.\nTL;DR:"}

He told me that he feels terrible and takes most of the blame on himself (he doesn't deserve all of it which I told him but the apology was great). He also told me that he still has nightmares about how he handled things and treated me. We ended (after a lot of hugs and apologies) saying that we'd watch game of thrones together on Monday. I know that I want to try to be his friend again but now I'm scared that the only reason we made up at all is because he was incredibly drunk.\n\nThe question is, do I email him this ( or just leave it alone?

So I've been seeing my girlfriend for a little over a year and a half now. Our relationship so far has been pretty stellar--we're both in love and very happy with each other. But I should preface that we have very different personalities--she's very sociable and loves going out, whereas I'm very introverted and love being a homebody. \n\nInitially, we lived in different cities (she lived at home with her parents and I lived in a house with roommates) but saw each other often throughout the week. Things have been going so well that four months ago, she actually got a job closer to me and has moved in. That's when the problems started.\n\nBack at her home, she was used to having a full social life, with her schedule filled with her spending time with family and friends. Since she's moved to my city, she says that, some days, she just feels unbearably lonely.\n\nAt first, I felt awful. I sympathized with her and tried to spend as much time as possible with her. We go out on dates, hang out around the house, explore the city together, etc., but it just never seems like enough. Lately, when she starts telling me that she feels lonely, I've begun to just feel frustrated and angry. \n\nThis past weekend, she spent Friday with her friends, Saturday we visited her family, Sunday we visited my family, and yesterday I took her out on a date. And today she still feels lonely. And it sucks because I want to sympathize and help her, but I just can't relate. To be honest, I find it ludicrous that someone who spent the past four days doing things with people who care about her could possibly feel lonely.\n\nIt's starting to really negatively affect our relationship to the point where we're getting into arguments about it. I understand that everyone is entitled to how they feel, but it's hard to not feel shitty when your girlfriend is obviously miserable and sitting next to you. I really want to help her, but have no idea how.\nTL;DR:"}

Then it hit me. Bleach. So I get the bleach in the back that we used to disinfect the pet cages and add just a drop. It worked! Like a reverse cloud the blue color began to dissipate. I added a couple more drops and walked away in awe of my own brilliance. I went about my other duties and walked by the fish and that is when I saw 300 gold fish belly up.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (27,F) started dating a guy (21,M) with a complicated connection to my life and now am wondering the best way to tell my best friend (34,F)\nPOST: Since my divorce 4 years ago I've avoided relationships like the plague. Instead I focused more on FWB and FBs. My best friend, let's call her Sheila, knows pretty much everything about my sex life, except for what has happened in the past month. Sheila has a daughter of 19. Her daughter gave birth to her son a few months ago. Let's call the father of the baby Jared. \n\nNow to the complicated part. Jared broke up with Sheila's daughter a few months ago. About a month ago Jared started making passes at me. Apparently he'd had a thing for me for years and I just never knew it. At first I said no friggin way. It was never going to happen... Yet, when someone seems to really like you and persists eventually it starts to make an impression. Jared made an impression on me and, despite my better judgement, we hooked up.\n\nFrom the first time we hooked up there was something different about Jared and I knew I was screwed. According to him he's been doing everything he can to get me to fall for him (he says he already felt that way). So, I started to see him in a new light and over the past month we've moved beyond a typical FWB situation. In fact, for the first time in years I could see myself in a typical relationship. Everything about the situation is wrong. I don't like younger guys. He's the baby daddy of my best friends daughter. I've never even considered him an option before. Still, you can't always help it when your head and heart say two different things....\n\nSo now I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to lose my best friend but I can't figure out a way to tell her that this won't destroy our friendship. I don't want to lose Jared because it's been a long time since I've felt this way. I feel like even allowing this to happen, at all, let alone as far as it has, makes me a terrible person. Is there anyway to salvage this cluster fuck I've created?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Said something in my sleep, need advice. (26m, 20f)\nPOST: I've been dating my gf for over a year, and we've been living together for a few months. The first few months of our relationship were rocky, mostly my fault because I was afraid to commit, but we've been fine since. I'm divorced, my ex wife cheated on me when I was on deployment, and I'm happy to have finally met the woman of my dreams. Things are going well.\n\nLast night though, I was dead asleep, pulled my gf in close and said \"will you be my girlfriend for the night? mmm...\" and fell back to sleep. I don't remember doing this. It isn't the first time I've said something in my sleep and not remembered, one time I woke up my buddy crashing at his house because I freaked out and thought I was choking (I don't remember that either, just had the story relayed from him).\n\nThe thing is, I've never cheated and I love her. Maybe I was having a weird subconcious dream or something. She's really worried now though. She couldn't sleep well, and before I left for work she was crying and asked if I've cheated during the beginning of our relationship. She is completely justified in these thoughts, I get it, but I really haven't cheated and never would. I've always been someone who will break up with my gf before I would ever cheat.\n\nI just want to fix this. I want her to understand that it truly was something I don't remember saying and it can't mean anything.\n\nThanks.\nTL;DR:"}

Nowadays we are spending most of our social time with his friends, just because they live much closer to where we live. \n\nHis friends are his age or younger (some as young as 21), and they are very concerned with age. The jokes pointed at me being \"sooo old\" have kind of slowed down, but they still happen every once in a while and they still bother me. (Sometimes at random get-togethers, they go around and ask everyone their age as if they've forgotten. Occasionally, I get paranoid and feel like they're just doing this so they can get to me and make a gross face when I remind them I'm 29.)\n\nI'm worried about turning 30. I'm the oldest person in the social circle, and turning 30 will mean that I am *definitely* ***OLD*** in their eyes. \"No longer in your 20's? EWWWWW!\"\n\nI realize that their jokes about my age are just a sign of their own immaturity, and I try to keep reminding myself of that. I really like most of these people, so it would be nice to have a party to celebrate this milestone.

I've been out of college for two years and she will graduate in May. At school we were both pretty involved in greek life (comes into play later). We have just recently been talking about where we want to go on our honey moon. We won't be able to go anywhere too exotic due to budget, some places that have been brought up are Denver and northern Minnesota. Today she asked me what I thought about Chicago and I asked why Chicago specifically. She said it's her sorority's national convention that's only held every two years. Two summers ago she got to go and she had a blast. A lot of other women from her sorority from around the country come and they hang out and talk about leadership and other sorority things. My fiance gets real excited about her sorority where I was less enthusiastic about my fraternity (still cared about it, just not as much as she did to her sorority). Anyway, she asked me if we could go to Chicago during the convention so she could go which would be around 2.5-3 days long, then after spend the rest of the week together on our honeymoon. My response was what would I do when she was at the convention? She didn't give much of a response, she kept talking about how she really wanted to go to convention. I hinted at me not being a big fan of the idea, but I said we would talk about it later.\n\nAs of right now, I don't want our honey moon to be based around convention. It's our honey moon and I believe it should be about us being together and starting our lives together. I'm sure I could find things to do to keep myself busy for 2.5-3 days in Chicago but I don't think I should have to do that on my honey moon. We haven't talked about this very much yet, but my question is when it comes up again, how do I tell her about me not liking that we would be apart on our honey moon? Am I being reasonable on why I'm not a huge fan of the idea?\nTL;DR:"}

Long story short, his dad kicked him out, and he was only able to grab his phone and his wallet. \n\nHe came over to my house, and he is currently staying here with me and my mom in one of the spare rooms. The trouble is, I don't know exactly how to help him! Theo's mom and sister are trying to convince his dad to let him come back to the house, but I don't know how safe his home would be for him? I don't know if I should encourage him to stay at our house until it's time for him to go back to college, or if I should stay out of it entirely. If he does come live with us for now, what needs to be done?

My father was physically abusive to her and my older sister, and none of them like to talk about that time.

Which obviously embarrasses me even more because obviously, everyone has definitely heard now and knows that my boyfriend shouts & swears at me. \n\nI've told him over and over again that it embarrasses me, and I don't think he should be so quick to anger for asking him to be quieter. \n\nHe is basically saying that it's not a good enough reason to be embarrassed, so he won't apologize, and keeps responding sarcastically such as: 'YES, I am the WORST boyfriend ever!'. I feel like it's not a big ask that he doesn't do it, even if he doesn't fully understand why.  \n\nHe also says I'm acting a bit dramatic, am I? Should I not be upset about this? He's done it probably... 6 times or so now, always shouting and swearing when I remind him.\n\nI just don't want people hearing private, embarrassing conversations. I've not got any proof that someone has overheard, but it still makes me anxious and panicky when he does it, just in case. \n\nI'm really interested to hear an outside perspective on this.\nTL;DR:"}

They all said no, they want to look at it, etc. but when she came back with my beer I pulled her aside and told her that her thong was showing, she reached to check and laughed, then said that's the aprons string. I said sorry I thought that was your thong, she said it's fine she appreciates the look out and we interacted normally, if not a little bit better than regularly.\n\nBonus question: What's a witty reply when someone says \"no\" jokingly when you ask them for something?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What are my odds of winning in Civil Court?\nPOST: To explain the situation as briefly as possible:\nIn 2007 my wife (who I was not in a relationship with yet) was dating Scumbag Steve. They decide they want to get married, so they go to a Jewelry store and together co-sign an application for a credit card. Long story short, things go south and they break up in 2009 without making any purchases on the card. My wife, the foolish young thing that she was, assumed the card account was deleted because of inactivity, but unbeknown to her Scumbag Steve still had control of the card. In 2010, S.S. decided to go on a $500 shopping spree at the jewelry store. He made one payment to the account, and then stopped paying and the account went delinquent. He moves, changes his phone number, etc, so the collection agency cannot contact him. Fast forward to yesterday, my wife gets a call from said collection agency wanting their $500. My wife explains she did not make the purchase, and together we get a hold of Scumbag Steve on the telephone. In my state, it is legal to wiretap an audio conversation with the consent of only one party, and as I was doing the audio taping I gave my consent to tape the conversation with Scumbag Steve (against his knowledge). In this conversation, S.S. eventually admits he made the purchase and he is responsible for the payment. He agrees that he will pay the debt collection agency asap. The next day however, I get a call from the collection agency saying he changed his mind because the collection agency does not currently have a copy of the receipt of purchase with his signature on it (this can take 1-2 months to obtain, and is often not financially \"worth it\" for debt collection companies dealing with such a small debt owed). At this point it looks like my only option is to send S.S. a subpoena and take him to Civil Court to sue him for the amount owed. Keep in mind I live in a state where the audio recording can be used as testimony against S.S. in a court of law even though that recording was made without his knowledge. I have already lawyered up, and am ready to get the ball rolling, but I need to know Reddit, what are my odds of winning in court?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [M/23/Krn-American] considering breaking up with my GF of 2 years [F/27/Korean]\nPOST: Hey guys, to start this off. I would like to state that there are culture aspects that you may not understand but I'll try and explain what I can.\n\nI mentioned in the title countries and ethnicities because culture plays a part in my problem. I'm a Korean American that spent most of my life in America and my GF is a Korean citizen who spent all her life in Korea. We are also in a long distance relationship. I'd say in our 2 year relationship we have only spent 5 months together in person.\n\n____________________________________\n\nWhat I need help with is that I feel like breaking up with my Gf because I feel like she can find someone else better for her than I am. We have no problems in our relationship. But over the past half year I have started to believe that I am not the best option for her. In Korean culture many girls marry before 30 and if the girl is still single after 30 people assume it's because they have a problem. My gf says she wants to keep waiting for me to graduate from uni and find a job before moving to America. But we estimate that will take at least 2 more years. By then she will feel pressured to marry even though she doesn't want to because of her age. \n\nAlong with that problem I don't feel like I can provide for what she wants. She likes to shop and travel. But with my current carrier choices I wouldn't be able to fulfill those wants. My gf has a good job in Korea that many Korean men like and will choose her when they go on blind dates just because of her job. The job she has also opens doors for her to meet people who are much much more financially well off than I am now and possible ever will be. \n\nBecause of this I feel like I should leave her and give her the chance to meet someone else who will treat her well and also be able to financially support her wants. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I'll be replying to any questions... And thank you for your time!\nTL;DR:"}

However, I guess I've \"blossomed\" here recently, because I've been getting a lot more female attention, and I don't have the experience to know how to handle many of the situations I've come across. The friend in question (we'll call her \"B\") is a girl I've been close to since I was 16, and though I once asked her out (and was rejected) we've never had anything that was more than platonic.\n\nSo, I went to a party last night (in reality just a small gathering of my close-knit group of friends) and of course there was alcohol, so I start drinking upon arrival, as does everyone else. Immediately B starts flirting with me, and before long we're on the couch cuddling and talking in between bouts of sloppy drunk tongue-wrestling. At this point I only recall a few things we said to each other, though I distinctly remember B saying she should have dated me in high school instead of the guy she went out with shortly after rejecting my offer. \n\nWe were both too drowsy for sex, but B insisted we go to bed together and I end up sharing one with her and another girl we're close friends with (oddly enough the girl I was pining for before all of this happened). We slept as close as we possibly could all night, with her often grabbing and holding my hand or putting her leg across my waist. In the morning we laid together and cuddled for a while and nothing seemed weird between us, though we didn't discuss what happened. I kissed her before I left and she seemed somewhat surprised, but pleased. Now, I'm unsure of how to handle the situation. Should I write it off as drunken debauchery or try to figure out where exactly we stand? Should I talk to her about it first or let her initiate the conversation? Personally, I wouldn't mind exploring this new direction in our relationship, but I don't know how or if I should relay these feelings.\nTL;DR:"}

He said he was terribly ashamed of himself and would never forgive himself, and that he felt he should tell me the truth given my own background.\n\nI was floored. I couldn't imagine this man laying hands on anyone, yet I also have first hand experience of how clever and manipulative abusers can be.

They have kids together and get on really well. They are in each others lives and seem to have a healthy relationship.

Thankfully our smoke alarm is In the hallway outside the kitchen and so didn't go off as the door was shut but I went straight into panic mode. \n\nRunning round like a mad man I opened all the windows and doors to the outside and threw a blanket at the bottom of the door to the hallway praying that no smoke escaped and set the alarm off awaking the 4 other member of my family in the house.

Then, kind of out of nowhere, we started hooking up and after a month decided to start dating.\n\nFast forward to a couple months ago, and she is starting to become really close with the guy (\"Dan\").  It made me pretty uncomfortable that he was becoming one of her best friends and doing things like getting dinner where it was just the two of them (although that only happened a couple of times) when she had just wanted to date him really badly and was super into him just a couple months before then.  I brought it up to her and she found it completely unreasonable that I would feel uncomfortable at all.

I really love this girl, but I just don't know what to do at this point.  I feel like my point of view is being completely disregarded in favor of her own, with no compromise being made at all.

Due to my extreme loneliness and no desire to find a girl, I ordered a premium flesh-light from the site. The site said that the toy was to come in about a week, three weeks went by and nothing. I checked the shipping to find that it was coming from some town in China, great. I had ordered things from China before, so I knew this wasn't going to be as good as I had hoped. Previously, I had ordered headphones and they came in substandard packaging, so I wasn't expecting much at all. Anyways, the package arrived today, and instead of it coming in standard mail, it came in a FedEx truck. THE ONLY TIME I had ever been asked to sign for a package was today, and the FedEx man looked at the label and saw in big print: PREMIUM SEX TOYS FOR THE WILD SIDE IN YOU. Well, that wasn't even the worst part. I signed for the package and then he handed it to me, as he did so, since it was so poorly wrapped, it fell right out of the packaging and apparently they sent the WRONG ONE! You heard me! They instead sent a huge rubber dick! The FedEx guy then said to me: \"Don't worry, you don't need to be ashamed, my son is gay too.\" Now I can't have FedEx ever deliver to my house again.\nTL;DR:"}

She even said herself in writing that she considered the issue \"resolved\" and that she acknowledges the dog had not done any damage. \n\nWe complied with her demands for the pet, and even though we violated the lease, we resolved the issue. I think I've read that it's not grounds to withhold the security deposit, and that the security deposit is only to be used for damages.\n\nSo far, we only have pictures of the place beforehand, the lease, and her complaints of cleaning, but no official list of damages assessed.\nTL;DR:"}

I've wanted to lose weight for so long, but ive always come up with excuses for myself or ive fallen off the eating healthier bandwagon before I even truly gotten started. \n\nThis time is different though. I graduated college 60-80 pounds heavier and proceeded to gain another 30 pounds in the months following graduation. This was all while playing two sports in college. My eating habits were so bad that no matter how hard I practiced, no matter what I did I just couldn't control myself. In November I decided it was time for a change before I caused more irreparable damage to my body. I cut out soda completely, I cut out almost all fast food (I still indulge myself in a Chick-Fil-A breakfast from time to time) and I cut back drastically on my fried food intake. These steps alone made such a huge difference in my life.\n\nMy changes are just beginning, but I am already seeing a huge difference in my daily life. I started waking up early and working out before work and that plus water gives me more energy than I ever could have gotten from a soda.

He, however, hinted at how he'd consider a relationship once I've made the transition. This was fine, honestly already better than I expected.\n\nHowever, since then, we've been talking more. And... flirting more. We've been in video calls where we were both shirtless by the end. Shortly after he started adding little x's at the end of messages. Then one day he said he loved me.\n\nNow, obviously, I was ecstatic. But this was all while talking online. In person, he doesn't show any signs of affection.

It wasn't precisely mutual, but neither one of us wanted to be in a situation where he was the bad guy, so we tend to present \"we broke up\" rather than \"he dumped me and it was terrible.\"\n\nThe advice I have received from friends and family is overwhelmingly in the style of \"you need a good cry,\" \"listen to some Joni,\" and \"he's an asshole, forget him.\" In the 30 hours between breaking up and touching down in the states, I'd estimate I spent 4 of them asleep, ~18 crying on and off and the rest distracting my feelings with reggaeton. Also being silently mocked by an 11 year old passenger on my flight.\n\nThis is a person whom I love very dearly, who in my absence is lonely and is equally upset by the circumstances as I am. He is not an asshole, nor will I forget him easily. I frankly dwell on the issue enough as it is, and think Joni will make me sadder which I feel to be an odd aim. I burst into tears on the subway the other day when a vaguely affectionate line from an Irish folk tune (\"Though autumn leaves may droop and dry/ A bud of spring are you\") caught me off guard. I'd like to have some refuge from my sadness and also hold on to enough dignity to not cry in public when I can avoid it.\n\nI hate ruining good songs with breakups, but all of the cathartic fuck you or I'm so sad breakup songs that have helped me before are proving useless. I've watched a few older movies whose aims are not romantic (12 Angry Men, Shawshank, Dr. Strangelove) and listened to some folk tunes, but am running out of ideas.

But he just posted a response today saying:\n\n>lol.... \" No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" ... prop 8 doesn't abridge the right for any man or woman to get married... it just keeps the term marriage between one woman and one man. Every Gay still has the same equal opportunity to be married to one member of the opposite sex.... Seems equal to me.....\n\nHe could just be making a stupid joke, but arguments like this really piss me off. They even piss me off to the extent that I am having trouble thinking of a good response. What would you say?\nTL;DR:"}

She doesn't make much money, and initially told me she makes less than $1,000 a month. I budgeted accordingly.\n\nAfter she had given her notice to work she FINALLY (after 6 months of asking) gave me a breakdown of how much she wants -- $1,500.\n\nI told her this is way more than I expected and couldn't pay it. I told her at the absolute most I can pay $1,100. I thought everything was all fine and good, but now I've heard through the grapevine that she is complaining to everyone under the sun that she's \"stressed\" about the \"pay decrease\" because she didn't factor in her insurance. She works for the school district so her insurance was very good. She also mentioned to me that the job she is leaving is now offering a raise and better benefits.\n\nI was just told from another family member that they will watch my son for FREE and I'm feeling like this is the better way to go. My mom can get her raise, not stress about money, keep her benefits, and I can put that $1,000 a month into a college fund for my son.\n\nThe biggest problem is that my mother is convinced that I am exceedingly well-off because I make more money than my parents. I'm the only one in my family to have attended college and I feel like she's looking to get paid a premium for not much work. I even asked her if she'd pick up groceries and stuff for me on occasion to somewhat justify the expense and she flat out told me 'no'. She's also mentioned going over to my sister's house to help her with her kids during the day... while I'm paying her to watch my son so he can be the center of attention. My sister won't split the cost with me or anything either -- already checked.\n\nSo, long story short, how do you think I should go about telling my mom that she should withdraw her resignation b/c she's too greedy?\nTL;DR:"}

My best friend and I have the perfect plan, to move out in May back to the town where I was during culinary school.

They keep telling me I need to stay home, save more money and trying to make me feel alone and helpless. They keep saying no one will take care of me if I get sick, they wont be able to help out or anything. I know its out of love, but I just need to be on my own again. I feel horrible for wanting to leave so bad, but at the same time I need freedom. I have a ton of friends there still, and I know I will be ok if I cant find a steady job, or get sick. (Someone will take me to the doctors or make me tea haha) I do have family friends in that town as well, so its not like I am completely alone.

My long distance girlfriend of about half a year used to shave but I didn't see her for a while (like 2 months), and she stopped maintaining her pubic hair.\n\nBefore she waxed, I would happily go down on her, but I told her that I don't want to if she didn't keep it relatively hairless. The last time I saw her, she called me immature for not accepting her as who she is, not just dealing with it (because some other guys she has been with love it), and hinted at me being \"misogynistic\" to a degree. I told her that I am not rejecting the appearance, but simply the impracticality, and if she needs someone to go down on her with a bush to feel accepted then I am sure there are plenty of guys willing to do exactly that.\n\nI don't believe I am an immature person for not doing something that I frankly do not enjoy, and do not want to do. I think it's especially important that someone enjoys any sexual activity they partake in - what's the point otherwise? I personally cannot get it up for sex if I even suspect the other person isn't into it.\n\nI don't think it's that big of a deal to shave. I offered to pay fully for any waxing/treatment/trimming.

Men specifically. OK everyone likes confirmation or something like that, but anytime I realize that someone may like me, I don't like talking to them anymore and begin to pull away. \n\nI feel bad when this happens because I'm pretty oblivious, so it's probably been weeks of this kind of attention until a friend tells me that the guy is probably interested in me. So now I feel like a jerk, but I feel so uncomfortable with people showing that kind of interest with me.\n\nI tried online dating, but everyone who messages me with any compliments on my look is automatically ignored. I can't trust anyone who messages me on my looks only. And that's what most people message me about. :( \n\nI don't even know where to start on fixing my problems.

After that I slowly move closer to her, and at some point my left hand is almost solely on her breast, not sure if she noticed (but she did comment \"that is my boob\" at one point, didn't say to remove my hand).

Since he's logged in, I see a third blog that's set to private. It has a picture of what I assume is a girl in his school. I found that picture on his hard drive titled \"blackmail.jpg\".

Keep in mind, she's 17. What i'm wondering is, can he get convicted of child porn at the age of 14? I'm still surprised by what I found.\nTL;DR:"}

I want to start a relationship, but I don't know how.\nPOST: This girl I really like recently moved to an apartment building next to my building (so we aren't actually living next to each other). She has been coming over a lot recently in the afternoon, but all we've done is play cards and talk until she says she has to leave.\n\nI've always been awkward around girls and she seems like she's way out of my league. I've never been in a relationship before, let alone even hold a girl's hand. On the other hand, she always goes out clubbing on the weekends, but she's still single.\n\nI've never tried making a move on a girl so I have no idea what to do. I value our friendship a lot, so I'm pretty scared that if I do something wrong it'll ruin what we already have. I've already told her I like her (a few weeks ago) but she hasn't said anything back about it.\nTL;DR:"}

This woman is a promiscuous immature stay at home welfare recipient, while her husband goes to school to be a nurse. They are a walking talking reality show, both always cheating on each other and they both know I don't like them or having them over because of their life choices (their choices, disagree but not being judgmental) I have blocked them both on Facebook for quite some time and blocked numbers from my cell... My girlfriend still talks to her friend regularly as they have been best friends for 18 or so years. Yesterday the woman told my girlfriend that her husband sent one of his girlfriends in for something we don't have, knowing we don't have it to start and issue and try and get me to mess up and complain against me. Well I have been there 8 years and am a lead staff, I knew what to do and handled it like every other customer, recommended options and she walked away happy... In all it was an actual pleasant experience, I tried to be as efficient as possible because she had a small child with her. well my girlfriend's friend tells her that now I'm gonna lose my job (not actually worried about this) because her husband is going to make up some bs about how rude I was to this girl in my store. They have details about the interaction that they wouldn't have if this girl wasn't in on it. She told my girlfriend that its because they both hate me so much. Only interaction I have had with the husband is at a BBQ housewarming thing where he called me a baby killer (us marine vet, combat wounded so I wear a hat) and I actually kept my calm and just grabbed the beer out of his hand and told him to leave. \n\nWhat should I do if anything? Should my girlfriend also stop contact with these people?\nTL;DR:"}

She is one of the funniest people I know and we are always laughing and having fun. But we get into little arguements a lot.\n\nFor example, today in class our teacher was going over a powerpoint and we were writing notes, she was on her phone the whole time texting. When she finally looked up from her phone the teacher had switched slides and she was frustrated that she wasn't done writing (Even though she was texting the whole time) At the end of the class she talked about how she didn't get it and I told her if she would have payed attention she would have and she got really angry at me.\n\n This is just one example and it happens on the daily. Just over little things she gets really angry and will be like \"Shut up!\" \"Stop talking to me!\" \"Why are you still talking to me?\" and she says it really loud and everyone will look at me and it is SUPER embarrassing. After like 2 hours shes completely fine and is laughing about it. How do I tell her to stop and that it's not funny? I still want to be friends with her I just am really tired with her angry outbursts.\nTL;DR:"}

Neither of us had ever been before. \n\nI told my wife what happened as soon as she got back and she is very mad. I knew she was going to be a little upset... but she is really, really upset. \n\nI thought that this would give my wife some closure (she has always been wary and never that fond of this person) and peace of mind, but it seems to have done the opposite, even though we will never see each other again. \n\nI love my wife and I want to be with her forever, but I fear that I have still shattered my marriage beyond repair. I did not anticipate my wife's reaction to be this severe.\n\nFrom where I sit, I have lost a good friend, the saboteur has failed, and my wife loses the opportunity to go skydiving with me for my first time. Everyone can move on. I think my wife has a different perspective.\n\nHow wrong was this? Do I deserve to be left? What can I do for my wife? What are your thoughts? If she leaves me over this, did she not want to be with me in the first place? Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

He took me to a concert (my first actually) and it was so fucking awesome! \nI really do enjoy his company. But sometimes I feel like he really isn't interested in getting to know me. Example: The other day we were in his car and we were kinda talking about the past and what not and after he was done talking I started to talk and when I said mostly what I wanted to say he just kinda made an agreeing sound and turned the volume of the music back up. Now I know he really likes that band but...come on right? Or is it just me?\nI think it could just be me. I've been in some pretty bad relationships the past few years. And now I've been single for almost a year. Which is sadly a record for me. But now when he is saying how he wants to be together all I can think about is running away as fast as I can. Which is stupid right? Cause I even said to him how I'd like to be his girlfriend one day.

He is a German Shepherd/Akita mix and super playful. My roommate and I work different shifts, so we are rarely able to both be home with the dogs at the same time - keep this in mind.\n\n**Here are my concerns:**\n\nQuestion 1: De La and I have been working on the relaxation protocol and are getting ready to move on to more complex exercises. My roommate is impressed with her development and is also considering clicker-training his dog (Remy). Is is safe to clicker-train two dogs at once? Or will this ultimately confuse both dogs?\n\nQuestion 2: Remy is not nuetered, but De La is spayed. The first couple days of interaction between the two of them was basically him sticking his nose in her crotch. Once he learned not to do that, however, he basically ignores her and sometimes growls anytime she comes near him - even if she's just walking by or sniffing him. What's the best way to go about this kind of behavior? (Keep in mind, this is my roommate's dog, he is not my dog to discipline)\nTL;DR:"}

We've looked at academic sources on the matter and there isn't really a \"THIS IS THE ANSWER\" type statement that satisfies our discussion.\n\nWe've discussed the following:\n\n* A book that prints an error is much harder to change than a Wikipedia article.\n* However, books are typically edited, meaning less errors fall through.\n* Wikipedia articles can be changed by anyone.\n* Wikipedia has a high rate of error catching. (One peer-reviewed article said something like 42% of the time the catch is virtually immediate. However, there are still hundreds of millions of \"damaged views\")\n\nWhat we found is that there is an abundance of research on the reliability of Wikipedia, but it is almost split 50/50 on whether or not it is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we find much less when we try to search for the credibility of books.\nTL;DR:"}

My friend bought tickets for us, and it is not the first time the guy was promoting a concert, so we felt confident. Now, the thing is the guy is just cheating some people with their money, telling them to go to his store, and then he tells them to come back later and so. I have talked to 3 people and they are getting different responses from this guy. Some people is not getting their money back basically. It basically depends on how (physically) \"weak\" you look to him, he may give you your money or not. I really don't look like a \"bad guy\" neither my friends, so that's not an option for me. Taking legal action in my country seems complicated, i asked some lawyer and as is just few money (around 100 dollars for 2 tickets), it wont go too further in that way. I honestly don't know what to do, i don't really care too much about the money, it's not that much, but i really hate being stolen just in my face, and there is not too much i can do about it.

Afterward her and I expressed some interest in each other. \nBefore we dated however we sorda just held hands and kissed each other on the cheek as friends. Sounds weird but to me it was a nice easy start. As of December 10th (God it is sad how I still remember the date) I told her I wanted to be her boyfriend and she complied, and from there on out we were a couple. This went on until the end of senior year. \nWhat caused us to split was because she was going to a separate college then I was. She agreed we could still be friends and I agreed with no problems really. Cried for about an hour, put together a model then went to sleep. \nHowever it has been a whole summer, and a few months into collegen ow and she is STILL on my mind. We met up at a con and apparently I was creepy to her (won't go into detail for now). That is what really brought this post on.

I am a 25 year old female who in the last year has lost 80lbs. I was over weight, though told I was still pretty, didn't get that much attention from the opposite sex. Finally got my act together and lost the weight (yay me). I am hit on constantly now, told I am gorgeous, beautiful, stunning, etc, and accept the compliments gratefully :) Thanks boys.\n\nBut there is a problem. Because of all the weight I lost, I have loose skin. My upper arms are horrible and I have weird loose skin around my stomach, and stretch marks. So, while I look amazing in the new wardrobe I treated myself to, my naked body is far from perfect. While I feel like a million bucks these days in clothes, I am really insecure about getting naked with any new guy I date.\n\nHere is my question male Redditors.... When you find a girl attractive, you think she has a beautiful face and a good body... then she gets naked... how much are you actually scrutinizing her naked body? What sort of horrible things would make you lose all attraction for the girl? \n\nThanks Reddit <3\nTL;DR:"}

In my junior year of high school I weighed 370, and I felt miserable, so I started to try losing weight that summer.  I lost 30 pounds over the summer of 2010, and another 50 during the first semester.  I hit 285 by the time I graduated, and I was extremely happy, but then things went downhill.

Since mid 2012, I haven't been able to get a job, and ended up gaining another large amount of weight.

I don't necessarily think it's the commitment that scares me as I like the idea of settling down, but the fact that I've acted out on these urges rather than just fighting them makes me disappointed in myself and upset because my girlfriend doesn't deserve this. \n\nUltimately, it would be nice to hear any opinions on this I guess, maybe hearing from people who were in similar situations would be nice too. Should I end it or should I consider something else?\nTL;DR:"}

I am a little bit too much sometimes, and I understand that, but even when I try to tone it down, I am the only one who ever initiates sex, unless we haven't had sex for like, a month. He never tries to send any sexy messages, have phone sex, do anything (not even mild sexual stuff) in public, etc. Earlier today, I called him and kind of sexily talked about how I wanted to know what he wanted to do to me. After about 5 minutes of thinking he says : \"I can't think of anything\". I literally felt like crying. He is very active and loves the sex when we start, but he even though he tries to please me, he always whines about having to go down on me. \n\nI don't understand it. Everyone says I am super attractive, everything else he does shows me he is crazy about me, & I have been told I am really good in bed. I don't know why an 18 year old boy would not jump at the first sign of sex. He would rather play video games with me and watch dragonball Z together. He does want to spend all his time with me, but we hardly ever do anything sexual. This is how it's been from the start. \n\nI have a vibrator and try to compensate, but I really want to feel wanted and sexy, with him. No one else turns me on. I'm really sad and confused :( Any suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Need advice: [23 F] looking for real connection but usually ending up with casual sex\nPOST: So I'm needing a little advice here, both male and female perspectives are appreciated. \n\nAfter going through a while of one night stands and some short-lived relationships, I've been looking for something serious - as in a real emotional connection with someone. It hasn't been hard meeting guys, although I'll admit the bar is usually where (I've frequented coffee shops as well but just haven't been approached there, not sure if this is relevant). A lot of guys are great and I'd like to get to know them more. The problem: I find my interaction with these guys usually just becomes sexual ie. more one night stands. And the understated problem with that is once sex has been involved, especially between people who don't know each other too well, the whole dynamic is thrown off and it's hard to build a natural relationship from there (from my experience, at least).\n\nMy own observation tells me that when I'm interested in a guy, I want to turn on all the charm I've got. And that for me includes: naturally flirty side (so I've been told) + tendency to touch people when talking +  boost from the booze.\n\nAside from approach, I'll admit there might also be a problem in intention. As I said, I know I look for a more genuine connection, but not having had experience in anything serious, I often revert to my old ways ie. charm a guy's pants off when I have interest in him. In a way, it almost seems like I can't wait to \"get\" the guy before I actually get to know him. Not the best mindset I know, but I can't help but feel that it's so nice to know a guy I'm interested in also takes interest in me, even if it's more on the shallow side. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm sex-positive and don't feel bad for having sex too soon with guys that I could have dated. I do want to move forward, though, with a right mindset and approach in meeting guys to find the real connection that I'm looking for. Any insight is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

We currently have a solid relationship. But it seems like we have trouble being in sync and understanding each other at times (that wasn't a problem at the beginning of the second relationship).\n\nI feel like a lot of the time, if I approach my boyfriend in a gushy/loving way and he doesn't react or shows no interest, I will take time to myself in order to not feel rejected and just do my thing. If he does approach me on his own later on, I will typically have tried to detach myself from the situation and will come off as mad and have trouble genuinely reacting to his affection. Which leads to confusion on both parts. I feel like we do not show this kind of behavior at the same time and as such one of us always feels rejected or unloved, which is absolutely not the case. I love him dearly and I know he loves me too. \n\nDoes anyone have tips on how we can resolve this? I am aware I probably have a lot of work to do on myself so I won't clam up when he is available and showing me affection, but I can't help but feel like it's unfair for me to be rejected yet have to be in a great mood when he does decide to approach me. But at the same time I just want us to be happier together so I am willing to work on it. I'm expecting for commenters to say it's my problem to deal with.\nTL;DR:"}

But sadly, I am like Raj from  for the big bang theory when it comes to talking to women, especially in group settings when I see her. \n\nThe Sunday night however, the stars aligned and I ended up driving her home. We really hit it off and have a lot in common and we were talking to each other effortlessly like we had known each other for years. Chemistry is off the charts IMHO. (or maybe she's just friendly...)\n\nSo I psych myself up all week to ask her out on tuesday night when I see her, but the evening rolled by and I couldnt for the life of me get her alone. Plus I sensed some competition from another guy five or six years my senior lol... (in other words, the clock is ticking)\n\nSo I saw her again tonight at band practice, and once again, interaction is amazing. Confidence is building and I try to catch her on the way to her car to ask her to go out for coffee, but I get intercepted by a guy wanting to talk... then I see her drive away... freaking eh!!! \n\nThing is, this has been all I've been able to think about all week. I'll see her again on Sunday, so I can always try asking her then, but I'm in some major need of catharsis! I'm sure if I can just nail a date, I can swing it with her, so I want to keep this good momentum going by asking her out sooner rather than later. Especially with another dude hot on the trail...\n\nSo my question - would it be acceptable to shoot a quick FB message asking her out to grab some coffee tomorrow night? (I already know she's free then) Or am I better off to let it eat away at me and ask in person on Sunday? \n\nOr am I just crazy and delusional for chasing a 19 year old while I'm still in high school. \n\nthanks for reading my rant, any comments or advice is greatly appreciated :)\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Paying off credit card debt vs car loan\nPOST: I won't get into the sob story here, let's just say: divorce, child support, housing market, blah blah blah. Long story short 4 years ago I was about $40,000 deep in credit card debt and struggling to get by each month. Somehow I did, without any late payments, and I've been working on digging myself out since things got better.\n\nPresently I've whittled it down to $26,000 in debt which is on a debt management plan. Prior to the DMP my debts were at 19% - 29%, they are currently at 6% - 9% on the plan. On top of that, my only other debt is a car loan with a balance of about $8,500 at an interest rate of 16.49%.\n\nI'm now in a position to aggressively tackle this debt and get it done in the next year or two and be free. The question I have is where to start... The typical advice would be highest interest first, which makes sense, however in this case it would mean paying off the auto loan before paying off closed credit card accounts on a DMP. For some reason I find this hard to do, because it seems like the car loan (though at a terrible interest rate) is 'acceptable' debt, whereas the credit cards are bad debt. \n\nThe other factor is that the place I am currently renting is for sale. It's entirely possible that someone could buy it, and kick me out to live here, or try to jack the rent up. I have no plans to use my credit score for a while, but if I ended up having to move I may need it. My score is currently about 680. I feel like lowering the credit card debt would do more to improve my credit score than paying off the car loan would, but I don't know if that's actually true or not.\nTL;DR:"}

I have never met anyone like her and she has been one of the most supportive and loving girls I have ever dated. There really has not been any issues in the relationship until I found out that she has been in contact with her abusive ex. Her ex that she dated 2 years ago for 4 years was emotionally abusive, manipulative, and had cheated on her. She went to counselling to deal with the issues that caused her to stay in this relationship.  \n\n I have asked her why she talks to him, and she says that he was there for her when she was going through her last break up (about a year ago). This was before we met obviously. She feels like he is a friend for her and that she does not have a lot of friends that are there for her. I know I can't be there for her all of the time, but do not understand why this guy has to be one that she confides in? I feel like I am getting played to be honest. Furthermore, he has some drug issues and apparently doesn't have anyone to help him out of this problem. I have asked her why she feels she is the one to have to help him out? Her claim is that she feels like she is abandoning him if she breaks contact. I have asked her to break contact with him for the sake of this relationship (it makes me uncomfortable that she is emotionally there for him considering their past) and the burden he is putting on her. I told her its best to suggest that he get professional help and to leave the communication at that.  Her first reaction was that it was controlling, but I am not that type. I want her to have a life outside of our relationship, but I do not feel that someone that was abusive towards her is right.

I've never gotten along with the 17 y-o, we are two extremely different people with very little in common as far as personality. But I have always been fiercely protective over her, you just don't fuck with someone's family. (I've been suspended from school for punching a kid in the face when he called her a whore.) Anyway, she's extremely hard to get along with, and has a rather abrasive attitude. So a group of girls at her new school didn't quiet like her. They've been threatening her and harassing her for the past 2 months. They know where she lives and have been seen outside her apartment. It's gotten so bad that she's moving back to Pennsylvania to live with her former boxing coach (sounds a lot weirder than it actually is). \n\nNow to the reason I can never go to Georgia, if I ever come into contact with the girls that harassed my sister so badly that she's moving 800 miles away from our mother just so she doesn't get the shit beaten out of her by a group of punk bitches, I will send each one of them to the hospital. I don't care if I get sent to jail or worse. People that gang up on others with no real reason are the lowest form of scum.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by misidentifying cigarette withdrawal\nPOST: Similar to many of these posts, this did not actually happen today.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I was posed with the absolute biggest opportunity of my life, being able to play the sport that I love abroad in Australia. In the weeks leading up to my departure to this place, and after my high school graduation I was indulging in the many chemo-physical distractions available to myself in the summer, during which I became addicted to cigarettes. I continued to smoke in secrecy through the offseason in Australia, but when practice finally began I realized that it was about high time that I quit. About three days after my 'quitting' I was hit with a soul crushing depressive state that I attributed to homesickness. After about two days, I decided that my best course action was to go home. I spent the rest of my savings on a one way ticket back to the states and reparations to the family/team that spent so much to get me there. In the airport, waiting for my transfer from Melbourne to LA, I decided to treat myself to a cigarette, courtesy of a man in the smokers lounge. Immediately after this cigarette, I had a 180 degree turn in my outlook on the situation I was in, but by then it was too late to turn back.\nTL;DR:"}

She dated my friend for about 7-8 months. We became pretty good friends over those months and kept a that friendship until now. She understands my sense of humor and we get along great. Looking back, I've always had a thing for her. \n\nBut, I'm pretty sure the way I feel about her is one-sided. I've heard her say a few things that stood out, particularly when asked by someone else if she liked me she said \"why can't people **just** be friends with each other\". I'd say i'm in the classic 'friend zone' if such a thing exists, since she calls me her bff and we talk almost every day. \n\nNow, my real question is how do I move on? Do I tell her how I feel? Do I just start talking to her less? Do I stop talking to her? And how do I do all of that without hurting her feelings? And can I stay friends with her? I'm lost.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [28 F] with my BF [29 M] of 2 years, struggling with his behavior and mood swings towards me\nPOST: I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years now. We were initially in a ldr for 10 months before I moved to another state to be with him. He is generally such a sweet, fun guy but he has strange mood swings.\n\nHe will for no reason shut down and become very passive aggressive, saying things to deliberately upset me. Then when I do become upset or hurt, he calls me childish and emotional and tells me I'm too sensitive and that he was just joking. \n\nMost recent episode of this was last night. We went to the gym and the whole class everything was fine, and as soon as we got in the car he shut down. Everything he said was super sarcastic and he refused to talk to me, yet said he was fine. He was so cold and it really hurt me. Then this morning, he said that he is going to trade me in because I annoy him and when I got upset he told me to grow up and that he didn't mean it. Then he told me he loved me and kissed me goodbye.\n\nI'm at a loss of what to do now. I want to text him but I think maybe I should wait until I get home to feel out his mood. My usual course of action is to ride it out and try not to antagonize him further. We generally dont talk a out these mood swings, he acts like he did nothing strange. But I want him to know that he hurt me and that this isn't okay. Also, there is a small part of me that wants to ask him how I annoy him so I can be better. I feel like maybe I am the problem - I am very sensitive and cry easily, but I've tried to control that and don't let him see it anymore. I just don't know how to approach him now. \n\nAlso, we never really have actual fights. I know from what he and his sister have told me that he used to have a horrible temper and even got into physical spats with one particular ex. He has never hit me or even yelled, just these bizzare hurtful mood swings.\nTL;DR:"}

Despite this we argue so much, most of the time because I always think I am right and she feels like I'm always judging her and don't respect her. Shamefully there are some things about her I don't respect, but overall I most certainly do.\nTL;DR:"}

He seemed nice enough and since he was in the restaurant on a daily basis and everyone knew who he was, so I assumed he was of decent character.\n\nI was up-front and adamant about not wanting to start anything serious, as I am fairly nomadic and knew that I wouldn't be in the state for very long, in which he seemed to agree that we would see one another casually with no strings attached. After a few weeks of hanging out and becoming closer he started in on how much he loved me and random pregnancy jokes. He would say things like \"Eat up, the baby needs to grow\" and \"Oh, you're nauseous? Must be the morning sickness!\", which made me a bit uncomfortable, but I laughed it off thinking he just had a sick sense of humor.. or thought I was fat.\n\nAnd then after a night of heavy drinking, it happened, we were intimate, and the condom was leaky. (How convenient)\n\nOnce I had realised what had happened, I freaked out a bit, and when he went into the restroom I grabbed the rest of the condoms to inspec them; Lo and behold upon further inspection, I found tiny little needle marks in the packaging and KNEW he had put them there. When I confronted him he played stupid and acted like I was seeing shit and then eventually blamed it on the manufacturer! Suffice to say that I stopped seeing him, and made an appointment weeks later for pregnancy and a full STD screening. But then the plot thickens...\n\nI received a text from him weeks later asking what we were going to name our child and if we were going to get married! (What. The. Actual.

First girl I had sex with, talked about marriage with, you know all the good stuff. \n\nI'm fully preped for the hatred in going to get from you reddit so give it your best shot! Lol!\n\nAfter about a year with her I went from being head over heels in love with her to just in love. Now here I am after 3 years and I don't even know if I love her anymore. I have thought about talking to her about it but I hate bringing this stuff up because she'll just get mad and offended and it won't go anywhere. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago something happened but I won't go into details. Basically she lied and she though I believed her but I never did for a second. I'm about 99% sure she lied and it's about something big. Ever since then, things haven't been the same. \n\nI feel like a Seinfeld character because I'll always have a reason to break up with her in the back of my mind that really is insignificant. Something small like we aren't voting for the same person, you don't like the same music as me, you do something weird. Just dumb stuff like that.\n\nIf you would have givin me insight on this relationship 5 years ago I would be screaming at myself for even thinking about breaking up with a beautiful girl who genuinely loves me. She's everything a guy could ask for. Granted she's not perfect but neither am I. I'm far far far from it.\n\nI feel like you don't get much better then what I have now. So me being unhappy... I feel like it means I'm just not meant to be with someone else. Shouldn't I just look past what little flaws she has and love her just like she does for me?\n\nI don't want to do something I regret... Wether it be staying with her or leaving... I don't know anymore\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU after playing chess with a girl\nPOST: This was from last year and suddenly remembered this again. I was dating this girl from a university I was studying in for a few weeks, but she called it off because she said she was not ready for a commitment. We still stayed friends after that. When I told my other friends we weren't a thing anymore, they were surprised since we still hang-out after. \n\nOne rainy day, we decided to go out and eat ramen in a place near the university. Things went well. We chatted. We laughed. It was like a date, but i was not a date. After eating, she told me she had not played chess for quite some. Since I wanted to stay with her for some more time (I still had feelings for her so I can't say no), we bought this magnetic chess board from a nearby book store and played on the eating area inside a convenience store. She was really competitive, telling me about her matches with her father etc, but she was having trouble against me. During the game, we were sitting next to each other. She was holding to my arms and resting on my shoulders. I thought this could be a good sign that she could change her mind and get back together. Being distracted by this, I accidentally made a wrong move and it looked like she was suddenly winning until I pulled off a stalemate. She was happy that I came that close to losing but then silly me blurts out (I was ashamed of losing) \"I just let you win intentionally here\". Upon hearing this, she looked at me for a while with serious face and walked out on me. I forgot she was super competitive and it turns out she has trust issues from the past. I blew my chance also of getting back together as well\nTL;DR:"}

Sorry in advance. You can PM me for more details. \n\nTo be brief, I have a great SO, a wonderful person who I greatly admire as a fellow human. We share many common interests and goals in life and every time I am around him I feel lucky to have such a great partner. When I look at him I see a great man, a wonderful friend. However, I have not been in love with him for a few months now. I do love him, but it feels like he is a best friend rather than a partner. I no longer find him very sexually attractive (no change in BC) and I find myself freaking out with the idea of staying with this person for the rest of my life. Imagining my future with him scares me, as I do not feel ready for that kind of commitment. I feel trapped.\nAll of this was workable until I met another person on a trip abroad. Nothing happened between us, but I still feel horrible about myself. This person and I clicked on an emotional level really fast, and before I realised what was happening I was falling in love. I see no future in it, and would not pursue a connection with this person regardless of what I end up doing, but it makes me feel horrible nonetheless because it isn't just lust. Physical attraction I can manage, but this tears me up. \nI feel horrible because my SO is currently struggling with very very bad things in his own life, so breaking up now would be terrible timing. He does not have all that many friends, and I know he really needs me right now. I hate myself for everything I feel at the moment, because he is such an amazing, loving, kind and funny person and he does not deserve this. He was there every time I needed him. My family loves him, my friends love him, I love him and I wish I was still in love with him. \nWhat do I do? I feel like it is unfair to string him along, but I also feel like it is unfair to break up with such an amazing person who has done nothing wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

We eventually entered a relationship. My ex is extremely ambitious, she wants her partner to be ambitious as well. I own a consulting company. It pays for an above average lifestyle. The company has been in operation for 1 year. I started the company right after college. My ex on the other hand worked for 6 years in the wedding planning business , where she made a little bit more than I did. She used to hang it over my head that, she made more than me. Me being competitive, I took it as a challenge and sought to improve my company. However, my ex doesn't realize time and energy are required to grow a business. Accordingly I'd spend long nights in the office making money. When my ex and I first met each other we had sex numerous times a day. After the honeymoon phase, we had sex an average of 2x or 3x a day. \n\nMy ex is a bit manipulative, she describes our relationship to anyone that'll listen that I'm not having sex with her at all. I imagine my ex rationalized she'd be justified in cheating on me, if I didn't have sex with her. But as explained above that wasn't the case.\n\n It was a bit emasculating, being with a female that made more than me, especially when she rubbed it in my face. But my ex and I earn toward the top of our age range, but acts like my accomplishments aren't up to par.

We both spend a lot of time with her, and spoil her rotten with attention. Lately though, I've started to get annoyed with the way my girlfriend acts when her cat is around. Sometimes her cat will come in the room at night to sleep with us, (we share a twin bed) and she'll squeeze right in the middle of the us and it's so uncomfortable that I can't barely move (she's a BIG cat, and we're already sharing a twin bed) so I kindly suggest we let her sleep on the small sofa seat next to our bed,( it's big enough for the cat but not for a person to sleep on) but she insists she has to sleep with us.\n\nI tried telling her that when she sleeps with us I cannot get a good night sleep because she wakes us up repeatedly and takes up a lot of room, and she said that she understands but she wants to spend as much time as she can with her cat and that I can sleep on the sofa seat if I want...\n\nI'll admit that made me mad, because I just don't understand what the big deal is. On top of this, her cat has a tendency of coming in and out of the room at crazy hours like 3-5 in the morning. She'll meow and meow for us to let her in and out, again, waking me up. My girlfriend wakes up every time to let her in and out, assuming that I should be okay with this as well, because she's just \"so cute\". \n\nI'm starting to grow resentment towards the cat (I know it sounds terrible) because now I link her with being in the room to me not getting a good night sleep. I think she's starting to notice I have grown distant from her pet and I don't want to hurt her feelings because she really adores this cat.\nTL;DR:"}

I could tell that I wasn't going to hit it so I sped up just a bit. All the sudden I see movement on the right and its a large black dog that was chasing the cat across the street. I didn't have enough time to slow down and i was told never to swerve for an animal because it can mean my death or injury. After surely killing this dog (I was going somewhere around 32mph) I pulled over ahead of the terrible situation and got out to go back but I couldn't. I couldn't bring myself to go back and see the animal or even confirm it was dead. And then I looked at the front of my car to see what kind of damage it had done. There was a fairly large (two balled fists together) dent in the front panel under the light. Then I just got in and went home. I got my food and went inside and just sat here for a few moments. I felt seriously bad, I didn't know what I could possibly do. I want back outside to look at the damage again, noticed an even larger dent on my right front panel behind the front wheel. It is actually a large dent! That is a bummer big time considering I drive a really nice car and I am only 23 and paid for it. but I felt bad for the pup and bad for the owners. I couldn't stop thinking about that. I have calmed down a little. I don't want to call the cops I just don't feel like dealing with them or going back to show them where it is.

I was very interested in him, he's cute, funny, smart, etc. We only talked a few times, but I guess I left an impression because a few months went by (October) and he added me on facebook. I wanted to message him, but was too nervous.\n\nFast forward to April and he messaged me. We just made small talk, but I got the idea that he was interested. So last Saturday around midnight, he messages me and says he's in town and we should hangout. I couldn't resist so he came over to my place and we watched a movie. The movie he chose wasn't all the interesting so he mentioned that next time he would get something better. He initiated cuddling and ended up staying the night with me, but we didn't have sex because I didn't want to. I'm not into having sex with people I'm not in a relationship with. He said he was cool with not having sex and that it was actually just nice lying with me. The furthest we went was just making out hardcore and some slight touching of certain areas. \n\nHe left the next morning and I felt that we were on good terms. We don't communicate very much though, and when we do it's usually pretty short. I'm just not sure if he is only interested in me because he wanted to have sex with me, or if he wants something more, but if he did just want sex then why would he mention the possibility of us hanging out again? I've texted him since then, but like I mentioned our conversations are pretty brief. I don't want to make things awkward, but I want to know! Should I just ask him what he wants? I don't want to scare him off though? Or should I just wait this out.\nTL;DR:"}

Just need some quick advice. My two dogs (mutts) had an oops litter about a month ago of about 8 puppies and I immediately tried as fast as possible to find homes for each puppy since I live in an apartment and can't have that many dogs. One puppy, a beautifully marked female who was the runt of the litter, was promised to my longtime friend. My friend is a sweetheart and an excellent pet owner, and almost every other day she's been coming around to visit the puppy. She cuddles her, posts about it on facebook,  has already picked out toys and puppy beds for her...but as I was playing with all the puppies last night, I realized I couldn't bear to give the puppy away. I love her so much, she's such a sweet dog, so cuddly and gentle and it would kill me to send her to another home. I want to keep her. \n\nBut I feel terrible. All the other puppies are already accounted for so that means my friend wouldn't get a puppy, plus she already has her heart set on the female. Should I just suck it up and give the dog to her when it comes of age or should I keep it like my heart is telling me to? I'm scared I will lose a friend if I do.\nTL;DR:"}

I broke up with him 6 months ago, despite loving and wanting to be with him very much (and still do). In short, he did a number of things that indicated he no longer had feelings for me after our 13-month relationship, and I was too proud and hurt to stay with him.\n\nI've hoped since then he'd apologize for the way things went - give me some indication that my judgement of the situation surrounding our breakup was wrong, and that he still loved me. Instead, we've remained \"friends\" over this time, seeing each other socially a few times a week. \n\nMy question is this: the last time I see him, should I try to bring it up? We haven't spoken about our relationship since the breakup, but there are millions of questions I have, and things I want to know. I love him more than anything.\n\nIs it too late? He is an extremely non-confrontational person, so a part of me thinks maybe he'd like to talk too, but I really don't know. He may be completely over me, he may still love me as much as I do him. Two weeks after our split, he was hooking up regularly (and practically in front of me), with a much younger girl...this kind of makes me think he does;t feel the same way.\n\nIn his position, how would you feel about an ex bringing these things up at your last meeting?\nTL;DR:"}

I was very confused about what she was trying to ask and assumed she was complaining about our restaurant's service.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised when she told me she was leaving the country in a few hours and just hoping that a manager would be able to buy her a Nationals \"cap\" and mail it to her in Wales.  Apparently, it had been her husband's birthday and they were planning on going to a Nationals baseball game, but it was extremely expensive to buy a ticket at the gate.  They were very disappointed and really just wanted to get him something with the Nationals logo on it for his birthday.  I assumed all my managers would say no because that's not exactly in their job description so I told her I'd do it myself.  She gave me a bit of money, her address and that was it. I now have the hat and am ready to send it, but wanted to send a few other cheap American items that one might not be able to buy in Wales along with a birthday card.

But this is something I've only really noticed in the past few weeks since he finished university. In school he worked as a TA with one professor and both of them made a point of not drinking while \"on the job\" but now that school is out he is home most days and his drinking has picked up like crazy. \n\nIn the past two weeks he has been drunk for 4 or so days in a row, or is just drinking in general on the other days. I am really concerned this can escalate into full blown alcoholism if not dealt with. \n\nI want to tell him my concerns and don't think he will totally freak out at me because lately he himself has been making comments about his drinking like \"wow I drink a lot, I think I'm a functional alcoholic\" or \"god I need to stop spending money on booze\". All unprompted to which I often agree with, but it turns into a joke and we move on from the topic.\n\nIt is unrealistic for him to quit drinking altogether because to do so he would probably need to cut out his entire friend group. He would also need to stop playing a sport where drinking socially is a huge aspect of it and that's not something I want him to do, or can ask him to do because our relationship hasn't been going on for very long. I just want him to be able to cut back on his drinking, save being drunk for like, weekends or the odd parties we attend instead of it being a Wednesday night and he's already had 7 beers by 9:30pm. \n\nAny advice on this is greatly appreciated!

I'm relieved. Its never been a happy marriage. My dad used to drink a lot and my mom started having affairs. \n\nSo I guess I can give you a little history of my family. I grew up lower middle class. My dad ranches and my mom is a nurse. Together they have two children, my brother (16) and I (21/F). \n\n-I never spent a whole lot of time with my mom, she worked a lot and in the end just didn't want me around. So I've grown up being a daddy's girl which also upset my mom. I bounced around from family member to family member when I was in middle school and high school because she didn't want me home. We finally kind of patched up our relationship when I went to college. She had major weight loss surgery and it completely changed her. I think her affairs started when I was in middle school and my dad's drinking got worse. They have continued up until now which has led to their divorce. She believes she is entitled to a settlement and I completely disagree. She really hasn't brought anything into the marriage. \n\nSo my question to reddit is that am I in the wrong for estranging myself from her except for maybe 10 minute interactions every couple weeks? She asks my roommate about me often but I just don't care anymore. I just feel that everything is everyone else's fault and she will never own up for anything that she does. Its my dad's fault she had affairs (8 at least), her mother didn't give her the attention that she needed, etc.\nTL;DR:"}

Rarely would there be a day without me having at least two beers.\n\nSo, less than 24 hours ago, I was working on an assignment I have in Uni based on programming for iOS apps. I am normally really good at all sorts of programming, but I had never done anything in XCode. I sat down around 1AM with the clear idea that until the deadline at noon I'd be done. \n\nLittle did I know the coffee I drank and the time I had spent away from alcohol would results so quickly in alcohol withdrawal. To whomever hasn't experienced it before, it's a session of really heavy shaking, visual blurs and slight hallucinations, auditory disturbances and a really intense heartbeat. I could barely breathe properly so went out, tried to find meds at the porters but he didn't have even painkillers.\n\nI decided to try to wait it out and by the time it finished, I was in bed, shaking, breathing hard and it was 9AM. I was tired. I was worn out by it. \n\nThanks to my stupidity, the chances of me getting a doctors note to apply for mitigating circumstances are fairly low, since I decided to just bear with it. And I am a day late.\n\nTIFU badly....\nTL;DR:"}

It would be one thing if he had been particularly abusive, or if i were interested in anything more than friendship (I am  not attracted to this person, and am in a relationship), but as neither of these is the case, it seems unfair to expect me to also lose this friendship in the course of their breakup.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My nose hurts when I sleep.\nPOST: So I am currently sick with the flu. I have a fever and a bad cough. The thing that hurts the most though is my nose. And when I say my nose hurts it's not like I got hit or anything, it's way worse in my opinion. So when I sleep and breathe through my nose it feels like I'm breathing in really really cold air. I can't put my head under the blanket or I won't be able to breathe. So I just kind of have to deal with it, but it gets worse and worse as the night progresses and the longer I sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and it felt like my nose was burning, that's how cold it was. (this might not make sense but it diidn't feel like it was literally burning it felt like as if a shit load of snow got stuffed up my nose) So I woke up this morning with the worst headache I ever had. And I'm pretty sure it's because of this nose thing. And this doesn't only happen when I'm sick it's just really bad now cause I'm sick. And I asked my friends and none of them said anything like this has ever happened to them and it's actually really uncomfortable and I can't even sleep. Please help me Reddit and tell me why this is happening.\nTL;DR:"}

How do I go about the after effects of this?\nPOST: So, my ex-girlfriend and I were in a long distance relationship about an hour and a half away. She was going to college, and I stayed home to work and wait on my decision of what to study in college. \n\nDuring winter break, she comes home and I decide to break up with her due to the fact that it was a toxic relationship. She had an eating disorder as well as anxiety, paranoia and easily manipulated by her family (mainly her mother). It was bringing me down and I was already in a bad place dealing with depression. \n\nShe then calls me a couple days later and says that she has Chlamydia. My first thought was, \"what the fuck?\", as I hadn't cheated or done anything with anyone else. I then get tested and the results are negative. \n\nI then find out she's been telling all of our mutual friends (even my personal friends that shes met a couple times) that I cheated and gave her Chlamydia. \n\nCouple weeks later (today), I also find out through one of my good friends back up at the school that I'm also a schizophrenic, sociopath and a master manipulator. \n\nIt hurts, because we were friends for 4 years before we started dating. I'm asking now, what do I do? How do i go about getting over this?

I was at school when I was having trouble breathing, so my friend drove me to the hospital and my car was left at school. I wound up just having a virus but I was panicking so much they had to put me on Ativan so I couldn't drive to get my car. My aunt wound up bringing me home to my boyfriend, and he said we could get my car in the morning. So this morning he wakes me up out of a deep deep sleep so he can drive me to school before he has to go to work. I don't even brush my teeth, I just hop out of bed to grab my wallet and we get in his car at 7:45 so he can make it to work by 8:30. At 8:15 we pull up to the parking garage at school. He is worried about being late, so I go to grab my keys and get out of the car....but my keys were not there. I HAD LEFT MY GODDAMN CAR KEYS AT THE APARTMENT WHEN I WAS GOING TO PICK UP MY GODDAMN CAR. He freaks out when I tell him what has happened - he keeps asking if I'm serious and I keep saying yes and apologizing. All fell silent in the car as we both knew that this meant he wouldn't make it to work until at least 9:00. I silently cried in the passenger seat the whole way home. The worst part was, when he dropped me off, I needed him to stop the car and give me his keys so I could get into our apartment. I was sobbing at that point. He gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and went to work. Sometimes I hate myself.\nTL;DR:"}

It took me about 1.5 months to pick one out. During that month and a half I mentioned a few things about weddings and stuff, and he just didn't seem super involved but I wouldn't really expect him to be, he's more of a go with the flow kind of person. \n\nThen we moved across the country. We were planning to move, just not so soon, but we took an opportunity when it presented itself. We are basically starting our own business so a lot of extra funds are going into that, but our expenses have lowered significantly as well. (Moved from the bay area to a place with a much lower cost of living.)\n\nSince the move, I mentioned something about our engagement and he said we just don't have the money for a ring now...but I know we do. We are not even really being that careful with our money right now, we both have a decent amount of savings and reliable money coming in while we grow our business. Besides that, I'm not a big fan of diamonds or really pricey jewelry, so the ring I picked out is only $350. \n\nI'm just really sad. Marriage is important to me and I was getting pretty excited to be married to him. Since our last conversation I haven't brought it up again. I'm not sure if I should even mention it again. It's not like he said he doesn't want to get married, just that it's not the right time. I understand that a lot of big changes have happened recently and it may be too much. \n\nI can wait, I just don't want to be waiting forever. I was never really the kind of person to put a time line on things, but should I? I know I can ask him all of this, but I don't want to put pressure on him for an engagement.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/jobs\nTITLE: Do blacklists/no-hire lists exist?\nPOST: This might be one of the dumber submissions on this subreddit, but I really needed to find some help. I walked out of my job at Target last year to continue school--no warning, no two weeks notice. I was fed up with where I was and I didn't fully think out the consequences. \n\nThe ridiculous and stupid part of it is that working in the food/cafe section of the store, I was eating some of the food I had to toss out and even gave employees free cookies and such, essentially stealing from the company; stupid as it may sound, I did it because others were doing it and they've been working there for a couple or more years. The new supervisor that was recently promoted at the time didn't know how to print out the schedule, so she printed out the wrong one that had private information about the employees and put it up for us to see. Next to my name was an icon indicating some sort of warning. It was only an icon, but the symbol alone was enough to understand what it meant; the same one appeared next to another employee I know they have issues with. When it was brought to a more experienced supervisor's attention, she immediately threw the schedule away.\n\nI was incredibly scared after seeing that and was worried what actions they'd take. At that time, I was thinking I'm working two part time jobs, have no degree, going no where in my life, and now I might have some serious consequences at work. It really made me realize how stupid I was for eating their food, much less not going to school when my friends were starting their lives after graduating with their bachelors or masters, and my confidence took a hit. I couldn't face work anymore and just left without any warning. They called me for the next week and I avoided all of them until they eventually stopped. Stupid decisions after another.\n\nMy question is, what are the possible consequences? I'm graduating this semester and didn't think back to what I did until now as I'm applying for part-time, minimum wage jobs while I finish up school. I'm afraid I might be put up on a blacklist for what I did and won't be able to find even the simplest jobs, much less a high-paying job.\nTL;DR:"}

Seven weeks ago I met a smart, funny, beautiful young woman at school and things got going really fast. There is a lot of passion between us. When we aren't out (i.e. at her place) half our time is spend making out, having sex, or otherwise fooling around. The only thing is, this is pretty much how we define the relationship, and the passion is there, but the connection is..... adequate.\n\nShe is much less experienced than I am. She hasn't hooked up or had a stable/long term relationship before. And because of this, I think she is confusing lust/desire for me with an actual care for me. It hasn't even been two months and she is \"madly in love\" with me. This makes me uncomfortable. I like her, but not nearly as much as she likes me. According to her, I am perfect for her because we have stuff in common and I treat her like a human being and pay attention to her. All of which is true, but that's like, the bare minimum standard for me. To me, she just feels like a good friend. We can hang out and enjoy each other's company for a long while, but we never get into mind blowing conversations and she can't really understand most of my experiences (she was also home-schooled and sheltered.) \n\nBasically, her presence to me is comforting and very enjoyable, but not fun and exciting. Part of me wants to say I am forcing this relationship, but another part of me says that this tension is normal so early in a relationship, and that I need to give it more time for my feelings to grow (which I see as feasible since on paper she is that kind of girl I want.) But I really don't know, because as I mentioned before, I have been hooking up all year and all I remember how to do is continue relationships based on sexual needs.\nTL;DR:"}

Last fall he enrolled in one of my state's top universities (in the top 10 at the very least) and started taking his gen ed requirements because he still didn't know what he wanted to do.\n\nIn high school I watched him as he flew from plan to plan, jumping between vocations such as Christian Minister and Air Force Paratrooper (turns out he couldn't do the latter b/c he wears glasses).  \n\nSo after a semester (and some change) of college coursework, he has decided he wants to join the army.  And I'm worried that he may find that it is not to his liking but that he will be unable to escape.  Or maybe it will provide him with some structure to his life.  I just don't know.\n\nI did a bit of soul searching and told him that I'll support him no matter what he does, and that his life is his alone to live... but there is still that nagging doubt that I should try to talk him out of it.  If he finds that military life is not to his liking, I'm worried he won't have a fallback, and that he could be ruining his future options.  Oh, also I don't want my best friend to get himself shot or blown up (however unlikely that may be).  So there's that too. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation/what have you done in this situation?  Do you think I made the right choice?\nTL;DR:"}

My question is, now that it's 100% done, what do I do with them?\n\nI've got people telling me to sell them or give them away and others telling me that I'll regret it if I do so. I just don't know how this stuff works, and I don't know if it's healthy to keep, especially in the future when it comes to other relationships. It's not that I'm afraid of throwing them away, I just love to have a recollection of memories in general.\n\nWhat is the best option?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [24 M] with my Ex [23 F] she says I should support her unconditionally, but sometimes I think she is looking at something the wrong way.\nPOST: My ex and I are still friends, and have left open the possibility of trying again in the near future. Sometimes we speak as if we are still together. This morning was such an instance. She came to me telling me how her mom has been annoying her, which is typical, the woman really does want to be in touch constantly. I am sympathetic, but my ex doesn't see the other side -  that she also calls her mom multiple times a day when she has a problem or something that her mom can help with. today, i tried to tell her \"that is annoying, but this is what parents do. try to see it from her perspective.\" and we spoke a couple minutes before my ex finally said \"when I come to you with a problem, you should support me, not take the other person's side.\" \n\nI see where she is coming from, but this is a real problem that she has. I feel that the people that love and care for her deserve some slack. \n\nSo my question is: Does support mean constant agreement, or can it also mean offering perspective and a voice of reason when appropriate? I understand that this may be something that varies from individual to individual, and maybe that is part of a broader incompatibility issue, but it is also possible that I am in the wrong here.\nTL;DR:"}

Wednesday, he cancelled because he needed more time to get his errands done, so I told him that it was fine, and I would just come over next week, because I understand that was his only day off to do all his errands, so no worries, I was ok with that. He apologized and reassured me that next week we would definitely see each other twice.  \n\nSo the plan this week is, that Tuesday I will go over to his place...and he informs me that our date has to be cut short, because he made plans with his older brother to watch a basketball game with him...so that means I will only get to see him for about 4 or 5 hours, and then he has to leave his place to go over to his brother's. And no mention about coming down to see me the next day [wednesday]? \n\nI understand if it's a once in a while thing, but this is like a reoccurring stunt now, he's done this in the past...always makes date plans with me, but then also makes plans with friends/family, which ends up cutting our date short, it's just starting to get highly inconsiderate.  I guess I just want to know if I'm right to be miffed about this?? He is a popular guy with tons of friends and family, but I just wish I could at least have him for 1 day all to myself, is this wrong?\nTL;DR:"}

Over the years I would talk with her once in awhile and she would give me birthday gifts and such, then as I became older and more associated with social media I here further apart as I was told to block her on all mediums. Then around June she got ahold of my number from a friend and started texting me. At first it was just hey, I miss you. Then it starts to become more desperate as she talks about how she regrets what she's done and deserves it, but still loves me and my sister very much. Then, on my birthday she texts me again as well as the Fourth of July. Each time sounding more and more desperate, also the friend who she got the my number from also texts me about how desperate she sounded.  The last time she texted me was August 4 with just a hey how are you? I love you. I haven't replied to a single text of hers because I don't know what to say. And speaking to her is discouraged. It just makes me alittle sad because all she wants are some words with me but i don't know how to respond because the last memory I have of her is her fighting my grandma.\nTL;DR:"}

I went to several doctors that only gave me ear drops that just seemed to clog my ear and make it worse. Finally, one doctor decided to perforate my ear drum to relieve the pressure and clogging. My hearing was back and everything was swell- for about a month that is. The muffling came back and I went back to the same doctor and he popped my ear drum again and put a small tube in so that it would drain on its own over time. He told me that the tube would fall out on its own over time. This past summer I went swimming nearly everyday and was sure that the tube fell out; it hadn't. I got an ear infection and was on antibiotics and the infection went away. After this, I went back to my doctor and he removed the tube from my ear. Well my hearing is muffled again and I'm going on a plane to California bright and early tomorrow. Basically what I'm asking is: will my ear give me trouble on the flight? Will I be in pain for any reason? I know I should have gone to the doctor earlier but I didn't have time so I thought I would ask the reddit community.

Also, I've only got class on Wednesday and Thursday, no Friday classes for me. As some of you fellow students know missing the first day of class is not a big deal, there's usually just a brief overview of the syllabus and maybe the course content, but the classes that meet once a week (which are about two hours long), generally divide the first hour to boring syllabus stuff and the second hour to course content.

To begin with it was great. I enjoyed every moment with her. We were always talking and laughing but soon that began to fade. We realized, or at least I realized, that we didn't have that much in common. It became harder to talk with her and it felt like I was the only one trying. This is when I first began to loose my affection for her. Then at about three months she told me she suffers from depression and anxiety. I was ok with it. I wanted to help her get better and enjoy life again. Get us back to where we were. However in doing that I became her psychiatrist so to speak. Every text was about her life being miserable or every time we met the conversation always turned to her depression and anxiety. This is when the magic just vanished for me. I no longer felt anything for her. It has now been three months since she told me about her mental state and she has gotten better. She is seeing a psychiatrist and there is no more texts filled with sadness. She says her getting better is majorly down to me. This is where my problem lies. I no longer feel anything for this girl. I don't know why but after helping her through her dark time it just sucked the love out of me. I know this makes me such an asshole but I can't help the way I feel. I feel terrible about it.

I'll buy a few games if there is a sale or something but for the most part I try to stick to a small number of unplayed games. He on the other hand now has three video games systems and probably 20-30 games for each system. The other day he bought two more games and was agonizing over the decision because he \"didn't really want either one of them.\" I finally asked why he's even buying them? He has so many he hasn't played. He said he gets bored easily. It just seemed to be causing him a lot of stress trying to make a decision on a game, when it's not like he even needs to buy any. He hasn't finished any of the ones he has.\n\nThe ADD part, honestly, isn't the most attractive thing in the world. If someone can't sit down and play a video game for more than 30 minutes at a time because of their lack of attention span... it's just not attractive. He doesn't read books either for this reason. \n\nThe other issue is, he's always complaining about money and he has thousands of dollars in unplayed video games, still buying more in what seems to be a compulsive manner. I'm pretty responsible with money, I do spend money on myself from time to time and I'm not psycho about it, but I don't blow money I don't have or even money that I do have. He just seems to spend whatever on whoever, even stuff for his kid which the kid plays with one time and then discards and he will just turn around and buy something else for the kid.\n\nAm I being crazy?

It made me really upset she wouldn't really help, she was just there. I've started to talk about her behind her back with the other staff but I feel bad about it, even though I like venting out. I just complain about how she never helps me and how she loses stuff and doesn0t seem to know what she's doing. I've done this in my other jobs, I think it happens everywhere. But does it? Do you think it is usual? Do you do it? Even if the boss is your friend?\nTL;DR:"}

We could talk about everything and anything, we spent all our time together, we loved each other unconditionally. We went into first year of University together... Unfortunately, she isn't very good at meeting people, so I introduced her to my friends. Now we have almost identical social circles.\n\nBecause of this, as time passed I felt I was seeing her too much. She gave me the space I needed, which worked for a while (she travels for work). Recently, even without seeing her for up to three weeks at a time I still felt like I didn't want to be around her.\n\nOver the past few weeks I've been considering breaking up with her. The only problem was, I knew I still loved her deeply, despite not wanting to be around her as much. This confused me, so I didn't know if I wanted to go through with it.\n\nI stopped telling her I loved her, which she obviously noticed. This morning she asked me why, and I (stupidly) told her not to ask me that question. After she spent some time crying she asked me again, so I said that \"I didn't think it was fair to tell someone you love them when you don't know if you want to be with them\". After some more tears and talk, she begged for a break instead of a breakup. I said it was unfair to have her wait for me to decide if I wanted to come back, so in stubborness I broke up with her instead.\n\nI felt relieved, but now feel extreme regret, sadness, and shame. She texted me a few times askiing me to explain, and I don't know what to say. I also find myself wanting to be \"on a break\" instead of broken up, but I feel like that might make it worse when we do fully break up. I just have no clue if breaking up was the right decision.\nTL;DR:"}

So my brother and I have a fish tank, and over the weekend we realized how dirty it became, so we decided to clean it out. While we were cleaning it we put the fish (about 5) in a small pitcher to hold them until we were done. We finished cleaning only to see two fish dead in the pitcher, so we flushed them and started filling the tank back up with water. We also realized the rocks and such in the tank had algae, so after we put in anti algae tablets  we turned on the filter and went to bed (instructions said to leave filter running for 24 hrs before inserting the fish). The next morning I woke up to a horrific sight, 2 more fish had died, with the last one barely alive burying himself in the others (last one was the smallest, don't really know if that matters). We flushed the other two fish and re-inserted the last fish back into the now clean tank. Here's the strange part, the fish is just sitting in the corner of the tank just staring at his own reflection. It makes me kind of sad to see him wanting another fish to interact with. Even as I am writing this he is still in the corner, staring (he is alive I checked) we will get more fish soon but for the time being he is the only one that will inhabit this tank for about another day or 2.

She is positive, upbeat, and quite fun to be around.  After our 4th date I ended up spending the night at her place.  We had been drinking and ended up having sex, which was mediocre at best.  I chalked it up to being buzzed and moved on, still excited to see her soon after.\n\nWe hung out a few more times, and the last time (Thursday) I spent the night again.  The sex was a little better, but I just don't think we are compatible in that regard and it has completely shut off any interest I previously had in pursuing a long term relationship with her.  I wish I had some kind of control over the way I felt, but it seems it just is what it is.\n\nI did a search on this topic but didn't find too much that helped me.  I just want to take the highest road possible because I never want to hurt anyone's feelings, especially someone as nice as her.  I know I have to be honest with her, but how would r/relationships handle this?  The way I see it (before reading your responses) is I have two options: 1) Make it quick and send her a text explaining that I don't see us developing into anything long term and that I don't want to waste her time.  2) Ask to meet her again and tell her the same thing in person.\n\nI could use some advice on the wording as well.  There's no need to tell her why, in my opinion.

Then, I thought, well maybe $500.  If I lived responsibly, I could probably bank $500 a month.  \n\nWhen it came time to enter it online, I got impulsive and thought, why not go all out.  I set up to deposit $500 per paycheck ($1000 a month) into my savings account.  I knew I'd need some of that money each month, but I thought I'd try to stretch myself to save as much of it as possible.\n\nNow, after two years, I've been able to pay for all of my trips (2 vacations, 2 X-mas trips home) with cash, buy some larger electronics (iPad, Wii, Flat Screen TV) with cash, and still have $12,000 more in savings than when I started.  \n\nI probably have to transfer some over to checking every other month, but lord knows having to make that extra step have given me pause more than once.

He would send me screenshots of women he matched with too. We laughed a lot. Had a wacky sense of humor. It was just honest and open, but mutual attraction was building. Salacious flirting was commencing. I asked questions about his arrangement and about the swinging. I have never known anyone who was a swinger so this was all new to me.\n\nI ended up going to a wedding in the town where he lives, so I messaged to see if he wanted to meet afterwards. His wife ended up driving him to the meet, but I did not meet her. He told me she was cool with everything and in fact was supposed to have a date of her own that night but it fell through. \n\nWe ended up back at my hotel and fooled around but did not have sex. I know he broke some rules of their arrangement but I don't know what those rules are. I don't know if the rule broken was staying out later than expected or leaving with me or something else.\n\nSince that time, he's been extremely distant, like barely messaging, and he said he had to lay low for awhile.

I knew this wasn't allowed but saw no reason I'd be hurt for it and, as the timing for me moving out was rather sudden and things were extremely tough for me, they were kind of insistent on keeping me under their wing. Because of this, I knew my taxes would end up with me owing money ($22 at the time, according to TaxAct) because my mom, who always did our taxes, taught me to always claim 2 exemptions on my paychecks because it was basically the government borrowing money from me or something. Well now I'm finally trying to file (down to the wire, of course, because I didn't have the money to pay even the measly $22 until now) and TaxAct corrects me, telling me someone claimed me as a dependent on their taxes (my parents, obviously). So when I click to say yes, someone has claimed me as a dependent, my owed amount skyrockets to nearly $500. I.. can't even come close to paying this. I'm in trouble because I didn't know what I was doing and just followed what my parents said which apparently wasn't right.\n\nSo I guess my question is, does this sound right having the amount jump that much?

We don't see each other without my partner present, he is married, and I am certainly not attracted to him in any way. \n\nI understand that people have different boundaries when it comes to what's okay in relationships physically, but it isn't like he or his family or completely unaffectionate.

My mom tried pleading with him to return it and he said he put it in an exterior parking lot(not at the rental company). She hired a PI to try and find it.  Apparently one of the exterior parking lot companies finally found it(about a week later) but when the tow truck went to get it, the vehicle was gone. Nothing has changed now, except she has tried to report it stolen with the rental agency. They told her to go to the police which have been bouncing her around from different agencies. Now since it has been a month, I guess there is going to be a civil suit from the rental agency. What should I advise her? She is pretty embarrassed by the whole thing and isn't thinking super rationally.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Is taking xanax and adderall together dangerous?\nPOST: It started when I was a young number cruncher working late nights. I politely asked my doctor for an adderall prescription to help in being productive, and overall I'd say taking it had a positive impact.\n\nLater, my job shifts towards public speaking, phone calls, social events, etc. I have always had significant social anxiety and attempted to remedy it through xanax, for both my career and somewhat out of personal curiosity.\n\nSo... Now I have prescriptions for both xanax and adderall. I find mixing moderate doses of them incredible. It reduces anxiety, fear, & insecurity while keeping me sharp, clear-headed, and motivated.\n\nI would even go so far as to compare it to ecstasy at low doses. It feels to me like it causes similar rapid dopamine release. Just a well of fantastic, positive feelings.\n\nSo I've been taking this a ton. It makes me social, calm, focused, and productive.\n\nQuestion: Does anyone know if I'm causing damage to myself by doing this? I am concerned it might mess with my heart, kidneys, liver maybe, neurological effects, etc. etc.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts, opinions, or experience with this I would love to hear it.\nTL;DR:"}

She may have kissed his neck back and promptly said I have a bf who treats me well and exited.\n\nI am mad and in any normal situation I would drop the girl and move on.

Things were wonderful until January, when they started to get a little rocky. We ended up taking a break (her request) at the end of January, then getting back together after a week. We hung out through Valentines day and then after that we broke up. I drove her to the airport the next week. She wanted to be friends but I told her I couldn't do that because I still loved her and I thought she loved me too and was pulling away because of the distance that was going to be between us when she left. She cried but we kissed goodbye at the airport and it was a nice bit of closure.\n\nThen she started emailing me, facebook chatting me, etc. I ended up responding (against my better judgement) and we emailed back and forth. Then she just stopped responding and I was worried something had happened (because of the earthquake). I'd always had her facebook password (but never went on) and I invaded her privacy to find out if she'd gotten my message.

My parents just divorced, I moved to a new town and new school. This was the teacher's last year of teaching before retirement. I've always been a good student, but I also get distracted sometimes and zone out (I have ADHD). So this teacher did a few things. First he started calling my Mom and telling her that I was getting distracted near the end of our daily \"math minute\" where we answer a whole bunch of equations in a minute. She asked him how many I got wrong out of the ones I did and he said none. She asked how many questions I skipped and he said about 10%. My mom was like wtf? So you called to say that while he gets everything perfect he misses a few because he gets distracted.  \nThere is more. Later in the year I rode my bike to school. I had the key to the bike lock on a lanyard. I was sitting in class and playing with the key while the teacher lectured the class about how slow they all were. He came up to me and confiscated the key. Fast forward to the end of the day. The teacher managed to LOSE my bike lock key and I had to walk home instead. My Mom had to cut the bike lock with bolt cutters, and the teacher never admitted it was his fault. Saying that it was my fault for messing with the key in class.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been talking to a few guys on there, and I think I may meet them sometime in the future.\n\nMy predicament, however, is I'm unsure whether or not I should admit something to them. I fell ill my senior year of high school with an autoimmune disease. I'm in remission right now, and hopefully will be able to taper of all my steroids soon. I'm now low enough on my meds that I'm getting my body and face back and starting to look like I did before I was sick, which is fantastic, but of course, there was some residual effects from the sickness.\n\nFor instance, I have some stretch marks on my legs and butt from a combination of the medicine and disease. My face is also a little rounder from the medicine. The face thing will go away as I get lower and lower on my medicine, but the stretch marks will probably be noticeable for awhile.\n\nFrom the outside, I look perfectly normal, and as of right now, I am perfectly normal. I'm making a full recovery it seems, and things are going great, but I'm wondering, when I get out with these guys, should I eventually disclose what happened to me this year? It definitely would not be first date conversation, but if I end up going on more dates with them, or even getting intimate with them, would it be something I should or need to disclose? It's not like I have a contagious disease or anything, but I am, in general, more germ conscious and will do things like carry hand sanitizer around with me, etc\n\nAlso, is it, in general, a huge turn off to date people who have battled illnesses?

Her mother(Jane) came out first right before the baby was born and everything was going fine. Her father(Joe) came out a week later after the baby was born and that is when things started to become more stressful in the house.\n\nIt is very easy for me to see that Jane is growing tired of the constant sarcastic remarks that are being thrown her way. I work from home and on multiple occasions she has come into my office crying just looking for a hug, which I gladly give to her. She waits in the office until she stops crying and then goes back out like nothing is wrong so she does not startle my wife who is incredibly hormonal right now.\n\nI am fighting the urge of just pulling Joe aside and asking him \"what gives?\". He is a smart and nice guy, so I know he can see that he is slowly whittling down his wife's confidence and emotional stability, yet he continues to do so with blatant disregard to her feelings.

Tons of support on here.\nHere is my story:\nStarted at 313 in February, down to 271 now (and feeling great). \nI have been slowly getting into running for the past month. I played football in HS, but that was 4 years ago, and I have never really enjoyed running. Read about barefoot running and that whole movement and it sounded pretty cool so I gave it a try. At first, I could only run for 2 minutes at most, but now I can go for a mile at a ~9min/mi pace without stopping and my run/walk distance is around 3-4 mi at a time several times a week. I'm actually staring to enjoy running! This could be the best shape I have been in (cardio-wise) for the past 4 years.\n\nMy problem is that even though my fitness progress is a HUGE success in my eyes, I haven't really been losing pounds or inches for the past month. Although I started eating healthy in February, smaller portions/more veggies and natural foods, I slowly transitioned into full vegetarianism by May. The weight started to fall right off without any exercise (besides walking the dog). Its been great for my morale, I thought, \"Hey I am finally losing weight and haven't had to count calories or work my ass off in the gym, why didn't I start eating healthier a long time ago?\" But eventually, I wanted to lose more weight and get more active. Since I started running and being more active I have stalled on the scale. Since I have been more active, I have been eating a lot more junk food and more in general, which explains the plateau. I need to get back on the right track and focus on my diet. \n\nDoes anyone have a similar experience where they transitioned into working out during weight-loss but found that the diet started to falter a bit? How did you overcome it and continue to lose weight while working out? I know will-power has a lot to do with it, but I just thought I'd see if anyone had some wisdom to pass on!\nTL;DR:"}

The reason this concerns me is because I have never made it past the honeymoon phase in a relationship. Previously, I have been in 2 long term relationships and always end up breaking up with my SO after a year or so because I find myself less attracted to them, less interested in sex, and bored in the relationship. \n\nThat being said, my current relationship is much better than any past relationship I've ever had. After 11 months, I still genuinely enjoy being around him. I am still very attracted to him, and we always communicate everything so well. We have a lot of the same views and opinions. He puts a lot of effort into the relationship and there has never been a day where he has made me sad. These reasons are why I want to keep this man in my life. \n\n**The Problem:**\nHowever, I believe the honeymoon phase is ending because I find the excitement is gone. Which is making me question my feelings - not seriously, but sometimes I will catch myself thinking \"what if I were dating someone else?\".  I find myself missing the excitement of meeting a new person. I also find myself less interested in sex as I was in the first few months of the relationship - although I am still very attracted to him. This might sound childish to some, but for a young person trying to find peace with being in a long term relationship, these thoughts concern me.\n\nI do know that I have very strong feelings for my SO, but I'd like to know if these are legitimate problems as opposed to the natural progression of the relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

I told him I was taking the bike and that he could call the cops if he wanted or that we could just wait on the street until a Police car drove by. \"How does getting arrested for break and enter sound?\"\n\n\"I have pictures of this bike in my phone!\", I said. \"I am never letting go of this bike!!\" All the people on the corner were on my side after a while and started telling the guy to give up and give the bike back.\n\nThis went on for a while but eventually the guy started to fade. Years of riding BMX means that I can hold a set of bars and NOTHING is going to rip them out of my hands. Certainly not this skinny guy.\n\nEventually I changed my tune and started bargaining with him instead of fighting. I told him I believed his fake story and offered him some cash to walk away from an uncomfortable situation and he gave in. He made a few bucks and I got the bike back. Win win I guess...\n\nThen I cheered \"YES!!!\" and fist bumped with all the people on the corner. I was psyched. Getting a stolen bike back is awesome!!!! So much fun!\nTL;DR:"}

We have been dating for just shy of three years, and things  were fine I thought. We had been slipping into the \"comfortable\"  stage, and had had a few talks about trying to make more of an effort  to keep up the physical end of the relationship, but other than that things were good. \n\nThe issue that lead to the break started because we didn't see each other for a longer period of time than usual. We go to  different colleges, but they are pretty close, so we see each other every weekend. He's been  really busy at the end of this year though, so we didn't visit each other  the last three weekends, so he could focus on his work. Then five days ago, he tells me he's grown seriously doubtful about our relationship.  He says he started getting concerned when he realized that he was  enjoying our time apart, and was not missing me very much. We had  a lot of talks from there, and things only got worse. Ultimately, we  wound up on a break. \n\nI feel like when he gets  through the end of the year stress, he'll feel a lot better, and will be more  emotionally available to be in this relationship. Our foundation is very strong, and I have a hard time believing that it's really just gone over the course of a few weeks. On the other hand,  he seems so sure about his doubts (if that makes any sense), that I am really concerned about the situation. Our break is definitely not just because he's afraid to end it now. Neither one of us thinks we should just break up at this point. But now I'm stuck being a park of this break, and it's killing me. I try to stay hopeful and give him his space to clear his mind, but at the same time, the possibility that it could actually just end makes it really hard.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experience with being on a break that worked out?

Being that he did not have a debit/credit card, I ordered the tickets for he, myself, and two of my friends.  My friends gave me the money up front, and he told me he'd give me it when I picked him up. He didn't have it and told me he'd give me it when we returned.  Putting my trust into him, I didn't mind and took him along anyways.  The entire time he was rude and wouldn't be around any of us.  Actually resorted to telling me I was delusional, schizophrenic, weird, awkward, embarrassing, not socially acceptable, ext.. Anyways, the total cost of the trip for him is $113 and I covered it all under the impression that he would pay me back. We've been separated for almost a month now and every time I ask him for the money, he just gets rude and starts calling me names or resorts to anger.  Because of the way he's treated me throughout the relationship, I'm being pretty stern about getting my money back.  Mind you I'm a 20-year-old, full time college student with a job that averages about 25-30 hours a week, and he's a 22-year-old who has a job and doesn't attend school at all.

She's only worked maybe two jobs in her whole life and each was for less than 3 months and refuses to learn to drive. She contributes nothing yet feels entitled to everything and *will* use anything she wants without asking and without remorse. She whines, throws tantrums, and never accepts any criticism for anything. We have to watch her when she cooks or turns on the oven because she almost burned a house down by not taking a frozen pizza out the box before putting it in the oven. Just last week she almost let the house fill with gas because she turned the stove on and didn't turn it off while looking for something to light it with, she wanted to roast fucking marshmallows. \n\nHer mother is the reason she's like this, giving her everything she asks for (junk food, a dog, even a *baby*) and defending her when people get tired of her behavior and tell her to get lost. It usually takes a while because when meeting her you'd think she was mentally challenged but she *isnt*. She's never been diagnosed with anything that remotely resembles a mental handicap so she's not even eligible for disability. \n\nThere are now four women including myself that live in a one bedroom apartment that doesn't have central air. At this very moment she's whining to her mom about how she's hot and wants her to do something about it, we're both trying our hardest to ignore her because saying anything will just make her talk more and we *need* her to shut her fucking mouth before we shut it for her. \n\nDoes anybody know anyone else like this? How would you deal with a person like her? If you were going to get rid of her (legally) how would you do it?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I'm [22/M] having a difficult time deciding what to do with girlfriend [22/F] senior year is ending\nPOST: This is a girl I have had a crush on since freshman year. It sounds ridiculous but she had been in a relationship the whole time and I stayed a close friend. I only let her know after she broke up with him at the end of the fall semester. Turns out that she is really interested in me too.\n\nNow this doesn't sound like a problem but there are a couple of problems that have led me to ask for advice here. One is that she has already accepted a job for the next couple of years and I am in the process of deciding on job offers. None of which are in the same city. Another problem is that we have only this semester (really up until March when I have to accept or decline offers) to get to know each other well enough to decide if we should pursue something that could be long lasting. The third problem is that since she got out of a long term relationship and hasn't been single in a while one of her main focuses this semester is living it up with her friends and focus on not missing out on anything. I on the other hand have been single for a year and a half and I have been living it up for most of my life. I am the kind of person that is focusing on using this time to prepare for being an adult and not focus on using the last acceptable moments its okay to act like a kid.\n\nThe biggest problem is I really really want to pursue something with her. I think she could be the one but the timing is awful. Either I convince her to spend the time necessary to build a healthy relationship or I sacrifice a future career elsewhere or I sacrifice our relationship. I'm not interested in seeing where it would go with time because I am a planner and for the critical I know she feels strongly for me but I am clearly the one that has the strongest feelings.\n\nAny advice is helpful.

Hoping someone has any advice at all really..\n\nMy fiancee and I have been together for 5 years now. Prior to this relationship I was cheated on by my ex. My fiancee and i have always been close and rarely argue. \n\nWe've pretty much had one group of friends but she could go out with her girls I could go out with just the guys. Great!\n\nNow the problem.. I went away for 5 months to finish university(coming back every so often) and while I was away she started hanging out with two other guys and one of her girl friends. \n\nI was fine with this, until I noticed her delete messages from one of the guys when I was next to her. \n\nI eventually confronted her about this and she's told me it's because he texts her things like \"thanks for the blowjob last night\" or \"nice ass\" and so she didn't want me to get the wrong idea. Apparently nothing has happened that's just \"how the guy is\".\n\nWe spoke and I've pretty much said I don't want him messaging her like that. But they still go out together with a few other friends I don't know.\n\nThing is, they could be just flirty friends, but I don't think I can trust that.. I'm pretty sure she's still deleting messages (I refuse to snoop). \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm back now and she is seeing this other group of friends twice a week. If I ask her what she got up to it all sounds very scripted. She always mentions that it wasn't just her and the guy..\n\nIn my mind, it's like she's falling out of love with me, she's loving a single life style and is just slowly transitioning herself away until she's fully decided she wants to end it... Am I being completely paranoid and stupid? \n\nI know I'm pushing her away every time we talk about it which is even worse.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Should I (F/22) feel guilty?\nPOST: I've been seeing this guy (M/22) for a couple months. However the past few weeks I was beginning to realize that my feelings for him were getting weaker and weaker. I wasn't sure what was going on, if it was temporary or not, so we decided to go on a break from being around each other so much, figuring absence would clear it up. Sure enough, it did. Only a day had to pass before I was quickly realizing that I was not into it as much as I had been before. The next day, I was hanging out with a friend I used to be into, and it was very unexpected but we kissed. I immediately left this person's house, drove to a parking lot, called the guy I had been seeing, and broke up. I am SO against cheating and never want to be a cheater, which sounds so fucking hypocritical right now. Had I known that kiss would have happened I would have broken up with him before going over. After it happened I called him as soon as possible, because it was obvious that I was interested in seeing other people. (I didn't tell him what happened and I'm not going to, I'm not continuing a relationship with him and it happened 10 minutes prior to me calling him so personally I don't feel it's necessary to inform him of what happened.)\n\nI called my friend later that night telling how guilty and awful I felt, and was surprised to hear that he didn't think I had done wrong. He felt that not only was it the same day that I broke up with the guy but it was within a couple minute time frame, so it's a pretty moot point about the actual technicality of it. He explained that if I had broken up with him 10 minutes before it technically would have been not cheating but it's literally the same situation, and the timing is not worth getting so worked up over. Another friend of mine said the same thing.\n\nI naturally thought in strict guidelines of the crime, but what my friends say kind of has changed my opinion. So now I want the advice from strangers, and I know it's going to be pretty rough but I want to hear.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: There is a reasonable explanation for most phenomena out there. That said, has anyone ever had something happen to them that just didn't make any sense in the past and has always made you wonder about it?\nPOST: I can't believe I'm about to tell this story, but here goes nothing. I was stationed in San Diego in 1991, so I wasn't super familiar with the area. It was a month before Christmas. I went out to shop, of course. I went to Horton Plaza but somehow got lost and ended up in National City. This was pre-cell phone era. I was told to never go there by a superior rank a couple of months before. Apparently some sailors got shot at a Long John Silvers or Taco Bell so there was this warning about it all over base. Anyway, that's all a little off track so I'm lost, it's dark, but then out of nowhere, I felt a feeling wash over me and it felt like someone else was driving. I can't explain it. I don't even remember how I did it, but I was back on the freeway (5) and easy as that back home in Imperial Beach. So I get upstairs to my apartment and my boyfriend hands me the phone and tells me to call my father. I do and find out that my sister was in a fatal car accident. Another weird thing to this story is that I had just spoke to her the day before for 2 hours, which was not normal because phone bills were through the roof if you spoke that long, long-distance. We used to have 5-10 minute conversations once a month. But this conversation was like a wrap-up of everything that had ever went wrong in my life, like she was trying to help me overcome an abusive childhood. I find out that she had gone out for wrapping paper and had her newborn son all bundled up and ready to get in the truck with her, when he sneezed and she made a last minute decision to leave him with her fianc\u00e9's family and said she'd be right back. As hard as it is for me to write this now, I still wonder about those unexplainable things. I am an atheist and don't believe in any woo woo shit and the point of this post is: Does anyone believe that weird things can happen? Or is there a \"logical explanation\" for everything?\nTL;DR:"}

And it kind of is, really. My girlfriend is a beautiful girl with a geek-ish personality (the bookworm type). We've been together for two years now and I've been happy throughout. But, as with any relationship, there are always small things (I bet she has a couple of issues with me too). You're supposed to work these kinks out together, but honestly I have no idea how to begin with this one.\n\nHere's the thing \u2013 she doesn't wear make up. As far as I know, she thinks it's too much of a bother in the mornings to apply it all (can't blame her). She doesn't completely disregard her appearance though, she likes to dress up nicely every day. Just no make up. It has been this way before I came into her life as far as I know.\n\nWhy is this such a bother to me? Honestly, I'd say it if I knew. My guess is that I compare her appearance to that of other girls, especially her face. I still think she is beautiful, I just think she would look stunning with make up on. Like, actress/model good. She's probably not at that level but I'm seeing things through a different, in love, perspective.\n\nSo yeah, it bothers me for some odd reason that she doesn't wear make up. I'd love for her to do so. What is the best way for me to get this across to her? Should I just tell her up front, or leave small hints? Or should I just let it go all together because I'm being too much of a vain asshole (I'm kind of afraid of ruining the relationship in the long run if I don't get this off my chest).\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading and I hope to get some good advice.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Advices on females perspective on affection for males. (Xpost from r/dating_advice)\nPOST: 25M here and my GF who is 25M broke up with me because I don't show affection like she wants. I truly love her and have always been blinded because I thought I was showing her love but after reading the 5 Languages of Love I realized everybody shows love differently and I should have understood her needs to do that. However I kept explaining to her I show her love by doing this and that but really she just wanted more affection. I'm stupid and didn't know this until it's too late. We live together, we've been together for ~6 years. I'm just working on myself and doing my own thing right now, I'll see her everynight and the first few days were a little awkward but lately we've been talking fairly normal or on that path to talking normally.\n\nMy question is what goes through your mind during this time, it was difficult for her to do what she did and I feel like she still has feelings but she's just trying to ignore them and make things easier. I know people say move out and forget about it but that's not what I want. I respect her decisions and whatever she chooses to do but if I'm allowed to show her it's going to be better and she chooses to come back what can I do to allow her to see it? But what I want to know is do women allow the person they love to fix themselves and how can I show affection without being too touchy as she doesn't even allow me to do this.\nTL;DR:"}

I had money saved up from working so many years before it so I, stupidly, thought it would be a good idea to take the year off and focus on classes. After job searching for about two months I finally landed an interview, but not just any interview... A video interview. WTF? I guess it's the new thing...

So, not knowing how awkward/funny it would be beforehand, I thought I'd take a couple vodka shots to loosen up. Not only did I \"loosen up\", but I kept making eye contact with myself on the screen and laughing hysterically. Example: **Q-**Explain a time you experienced bad customer service. **Me-** \"I went into a...pffffffft...pffft.... store once and a girl named Jes---bahahahaaaaa! Sorry..\" I would say I really, REALLY fucked up. But people must've done much worse than me, because I've already heard back from them.\nTL;DR:"}

I stay home with her (and go to school online) and have always been her primary caretaker. In total, my husband and I have had about five dates since she was born. She even came with us on our honeymoon last October.\n\nI have been apart from her alone many times (trips to the doctor, grocery store, etc.) as has my husband. However, we have never been away from her for the night. The longest was around 5-6 hours on our anniversary last year. The only time she has been away from her own bed was during a family vacation. It did not go well. She had all of her favorite items, but she relies heavily on the comfort of home.\n\nWell, I just bought midnight showing tickets for The Hobbit (SO EXCITED) on Dec. 14th. My mom is ready and willing (and has been since my daughter was born) to take her for the night. Heck, she'd take her for weeks if I'd let her.\n\nI've committed to this adventure by buying these tickets. I just dropped $48 so that my husband, brother, and I can go stand in line and then see a movie (that I am, again, SO EXCITED about). I cannot back out or chicken out or wuss out. I have committed to being away from my beautiful kid for an entire night.\n\nSo, beyond my own insecurities (I'm going to miss her, I know it) I'm worried about how she'll handle being at my mom's house. She loves being there during the day, LOVES her Grammy, and my mom is amazing with her. She's just never been without me. I cannot even stay and help her get to sleep, because I'll have to be in line for the movie.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm rambling or asking for advice. Have any other parents got any tips for getting over this attachment hump?\nTL;DR:"}

We both live in the same area, so I said lets go out to dinner sometime whenever she is back in the area.  She said sure, and we went our separate ways.  I honestly never thought I would see her again and didn't even think about it.\n\nFast forward one year later, all of a sudden I get a text saying, \"Hey, Thursday dinner?  It's been to long.\"  We ended up meeting for dinner and it went pretty well from my perspective.  She mentioned her boyfriend briefly and how she is struggling with the fact the he lives 4 hours away.  But most of the conversation we talked about our jobs and I joked about stuff and made her laugh, \"Ha ha, you're so funny.\"  We talked about going out on the town sometime and going hiking during the weekend, but her boyfriend was coming up to see her.  As we were about to leave I said we should have dinner again, and she immediately setup another time next week.\n\nOver the weekend, that her boyfriend was over, she sent me a text at 11PM with just the name of a bar.  I wanted to go meet up but I was an hour away, hanging with my buddies and by the time I drove back to my apartment changed and went out it would have been 1AM, so I texted her back telling her this and haven't heard anything since then.\n\nSo am I reading into things?  If she didn't have a boyfriend, I am pretty sure the signs are telling me she is interested in me, but the fact that she does kinda complicates things.  Am I friend zoned or should I go for it.  Right now I am thinking just F$#$ it and go for it, but maybe you can provide some insight in anything I might have missed.  I have a feeling its not as complicated as I make it out to be in my head, and I am trying not to fall in the trap of over thinking things.\nTL;DR:"}

For example, she has always told me that being a little insecure shows you care - this is something I never agreed or understood because I am not insecure at all and I fully trust her. However, I don't really know how to convince her of otherwise so we usually just drop the topic.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel like this train of thought has transferred to a lot of actions that are starting to wear on me and annoy me. For example, she has expressed early on in the relationship that she does not want me to smoke weed which I was fine with and I promised her I would not. I have told her I was curious about smoking weed and that I didn't see anything wrong with it, but I did end up making the promise anyways. However, she knows that my friends do smoke weed and as a result, every time we have a large gathering, she would ask me if I was smoking weed.\n\nThis kind of questioning bothers me a lot because it feels like she does not trust me and constantly feels like I will break my promise. I've asked her nicely to stop questioning me but instead she became quite upset because she can't understand why I can't just answer such a simple question. She also said that she doesnt understand why she can't just ask for reassurance and why I'm forcing her to stop asking questions and that she will be a lot more upset if she's not even allowed to ask questions.\n\nI have tried explaining to her that all this questioning makes me feel like she doesn't trust me but she just replies that it's not about trust, she just doesn't think its a crime to ask questions. This is just one example of a topic she asks me about. She also frequently expresses her worry about me cheating on her or getting tempted by other girls when I have never done anything to make her suspicious that I would cheat on her.\n\nI frankly don't know what else to say to explain my position any better.

I can't stand and watch, I just can't I know it is immature and I should be more grown up than this but these feelings is keeping me a prisoner, I can't even focus on other girls I just keep throwing them out of my life even though they are amazing girls, so I need to stay away from her, without telling her how I feel that is not an option, how do I kill this friendship?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: 20M approached me, 19F, and admitted feelings for me just a month after he got dumped by girlfriend 20F of four years. I got together with him but I'm afraid I'm just a rebound.\nPOST: Hello! \n\nRecently (August), I was asked out by 20M. I started developing a crush on him around June but he unfortunately had a girlfriend (a girl who hangs out with the same group of friends I do), so nothing came of it. Then out of the blue, she breaks up with him. I try not to be too overjoyed but of course, I am. I still feel guilty about this. I made no moves until he approached me at the beginning of August. I admitted my feelings to him and he also admitted he had started developing feelings for me too after the break up.\n\nSo, a few weeks later (end of August) he asks me to be his girlfriend and I say yes! Right now we're really happy. We're both in university and live about an hour away from each other but he comes to visit a lot and I love it. I'm having a great time. The only issue is I still feel bad about his ex. I was becoming relatively good friends with her and she approached me after 20M and I got together, telling me she was devastated because she'd realised she still loved him. I was hurting, I knew there was a possibility he could go back to her, but he didn't. She told him too but he just said it's too damn late.\n\nAll of my friends are also commenting on the fact that I'm probably just a rebound. After being with his ex for four and a half years, it is a little weird that just a month later he admits feelings towards me, but that doesn't have to mean I'm a rebound does it?\n\nI'm pretty confused because a part of me believes he'll only be with me if he really wants to be with me. There's a chance he just found me and preferred me over her. There's also a chance though that he needs someone to help him recover from a breakup, and that's just me. I'll only be here for a few months, perhaps.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I think I'm being cheated on, so I kind of need some advice\nPOST: Ok, so I started dating this girl a year and a half ago. She was an au pair and while we both said we didn't want to, we got kind of serious pretty quick. After about a year she started getting really homesick and we decided that she should go home and that we would do long distance until we figured things out. Things got sour after a while because of the difficulty communicating with an 11 hour time difference and we broke up but she never wanted to break contact. I kind of like to go the Ghost Protocol route with ex's when we break up so eventually I had to answer one of her messages if for no other reason than to stop the madness. Now don't get me wrong, I loved the girl, but my only way of dealing with not being with someone like that is to close that chapter on my life. So to get back on track, I finally break down and talk to her and she tells me how big of a mistake it all was to leave and then to break up. She tells me how she wants to be with me and she wants to \"give us a chance\". So basically I say she is right and that we were hasty and we start talking pretty regularly. She asks me multiple times if I'm talking to girls and I always explain that it is the last thing on my mind and she has said the same. Now here's the thing. My phone broke a couple weeks ago and I haven't had the money to replace it because I do catering and my hours are based on the amount of orders. I haven't had any hours really since my phone broke due to a random dry spell and so it's still not fixed and communicating with anyone these days seems to be impossible. I don't know how we lived even a decade ago without cellphones. I've been off Facebook for months, ever since my ex and I broke up actually, so I guess that would be my communication outlet without a cellphone. My buddy has been telling me this for a week or so, finally he told me to look at his FB and it's her profile with another guy time-stamped yesterday with the label of \"Psychedelic Boyfriend\".\nTL;DR:"}

The sad part about it all is the people who take advantage of her all the time. She hires a maid who steals from her regularly (caught red handed 3x now but mom refuses to press charges and keeps inviting her back to help), or people come into the house and steal things from her freely since she hasn't locked the doors in over 40 years now. The house is a first class wreck at this point as she's a level 3 hoarder. She gets sick (like have to go to the hospital for 2-3 days - THAT kind of sick) from time to time because she eats under-cooked or rotten foods left in the refrigerator for days/weeks, etc.\n\nI've talked with my siblings about taking away her drivers license which would put her in a situation where she would require assistance by force majure but none will endorse it even if I were the one responsible.\nTL;DR:"}

So I have been thinking about bringing up the possibility of changing our relationship to be more open, at least for a little while, so I can have some freedom. A major factor is that he doesnt even like online chatting and makes a big deal of it (he feels like a father figure about it to me sometimes...) and I dont mean \"cyber sex\" bullshit, just chatting. He is very co-dependent/clingy and sometimes a little jealous but he makes a conscious effort not to be jealous and beligerent. I see myself being with him the rest of my life, but I dont want to lose the chance to live a little before settling down. Ive been thinking about maybe even finding my own apartment or something... I just dont know what to do. I dont want to just keep supressing my wants and let us fall apart because of it. We have always been very open in communicating until lately... :/ is what im wanting what most people would call a \"break\"?

He's super sweet, very quiet and loves being around us. However, since he spent 4 years in a small house with that many animals and people, he has a pretty big problem with separation anxiety. We tried crating him last night and he was fine, as long as we were in the same room. But, as soon as we left, he started barking like crazy and trying to undo the latches of his crate (he had barked once in the first 48 hours we had him and it was at a TV). We finally let him out and let him sleep in our room (he alternated between his bed and our bed). \n\nMy girlfriend and I both work 8-6 jobs, but I work a few minutes away, so I can take him at lunch to go the bathroom or walks. He's not very interested in toys and doesn't really chew anything, so a Kong or distraction toy won't really help him too much. \n\nFrom what I've read so far, I've seen lots of:   \n* Don't make a big emotional thing about coming and going  \n* Practice leaving for a few minutes to get him comfortable about being alone. Extend the time you go as time goes on.  \n* If he has such a strong reaction to crating, don't use one, because it will only make it worse.\n\nI was wondering if anybody had an advice on how to deal with this?\nTL;DR:"}

The timing was pretty bad...

I tried to chalk it up to our both being stressed out in various ways by the move.\n\nAs we've spent more time together and he's gotten more comfortable, I am seeing more of a side of him that was more easily kept under wraps before I was live-in.  Temper, contempt, unsettling world view differences, and general capacity for meanness.  \n\nNow I'm moved in and I've become close with his kid, so I want to be as respectful and mindful as possible about the way I get out.

This feels slimy.

Our first daughter had reflux and bf lasted about 4 months. Here's the situation:\nShe won't sleep. At all. We both know she's OT and we have tried almost everything. Swaddling, different swaddles, hates a pacifier but will suck on your pinky for an eternity and still be wide awake. I'm sure I'm missing stuff. She sleeps in a rock n play next to mom at night and every night is the same. Several hours trying to get her to fall asleep, then as soon as she is we lay her down and you all know what happens. Then 90 minutes later, bam. Rinse and repeat. My wife is losing her mind staying at home with the 6 wk old and the 2 yr old. We know that 6 wks is the peak for fussiness but it doesn't even seem like she's fussy. She just stares off into nothing and stays awake. \n\nI suggested my wife pump some breast milk and try bottle feeding; this idea was shot down by her and her mother (I told her to talk to her mom). My thinking comes from the experience we had with our first, she wasnt getting full meals and then when we started using a bottle, problem solved. My wife says no because she wants the bf experience and wants to push through until they get it worked out. I feel differently because i want both of them to be taken care lf and thats not happening. The worst part is this situation is starting to tear at my wife and I. Every day is an argument and nights are even worse. I'm not here to discuss how the arguments start or what my wife does to annoy me. What are we not thinking of? Our first was fussy and had the usual stubbornness but it was nothing like this.

The problem is that M is telling them to give her the money, since she is behind in rent and took the family out to dinner after the funeral.\n\nF also received a pension, 75% of which will now be received by M. She should give that to her daughters but G does not trust her to do that.\n\nAnd now M discovered F had life insurance, which she will likely receive.

That said, I have never had a girlfriend, kissed a girl etc. So one day while I'm on the bus, I overhear this girl and guy in conversation exchange names. I wasn't engaged in the conversation but the girl decided to turn to ask me what my name is anyway. I told her my name (Emmanuel) and she told me she liked it and that it was Jesus' name. I was at a loss for words like usual so I just did a closed mouth smile, looked away, put my earbuds in, and reviewed how awkward the interaction was.\n\nThe second time I saw her was when I sat next to her in the commons building of my college when we were waiting for the bus. I'm just sitting next to her dickin' around on my phone when she decides to take out a granola bar and offer me half. I decline and she responds with, \"you probably wouldn't want to eat off of me anyway\". I thought it was strange that she would say something so insecure considering how beautiful she was. But I didn't bother asking why she would say that because it was a long day and I was tired.\n\nThe last time I saw her in the commons she sat right next to me. There were other empty seats but she decided to sit right next to me. As she was approaching the seat we made eye contact but said nothing. This is when I finally realized that she may be giving me IOIs (Indicators of Interest). I haven't seen her anywhere since then though. Now I wonder what could have happened if I spoke to her. I can message her on Facebook but isn't that creepy? What would I even say? Should I just forget it ever happened?\nTL;DR:"}

Does anyone know what these type of tests involve and how to do well?\nPOST: I have to do an online 'numerical reasoning test' for a job application I made. The job is a graduate job with a section of the UK government. The requirements did not specify a numerical degree (maths/science/engineering) and my degree background is in history. Moreover, I haven't done any maths since age 16 and I find mathematical problems very hard. My brain just honestly isn't wired the right way to quickly deal with sets of numbers; it's a bit like having a number-based dyslexica. This is only the second stage of the application process (the first was just sending off an online form), and I really don't want to balls up the whole thing just because maths isn't my strong point. I feel like any numbers I could possibly encounter in the actual job can be dealt with using a calculator, a computer, or asking a co-worker. I know that I could ask my boyfriend for help with the online test, but I'm worried that they will re-test people in person at a later stage and it will be obvious that I didn't do the first one myself. Has anyone come across this sort of test before? What was it like? Is there any 'set' way of doing well even if maths isn't one of your strengths?\nTL;DR:"}

It's had its ups and downs so far, he's been telling myself and three other people that he wanted to move them up but never has even with a position opening up. He makes me perform manager duties to save on labor but when he finds the smallest thing wrong he says I can't be supervisor because I didn't write a name on a cup and that's not what\n he looks for in management. Also he takes everything extremely personal so if talking to him ends up in an arguement on how Im not doing a better job if i wanted to move up.

Recently I've been offered a supervisor position at vans for a higher pay and better hours with one of my good friends and I just need to go through my second interview.

It's just the two of us, and we barely make enough to get by right now.  We had an order back in late August which we fulfilled and everything was fine.\n\nLast month we received a dispute on this order.  The items were shipped to the card holders billing address and signed for by the card holder.  We fought the dispute and won.\n\nWe have now received another dispute on this transaction.  The card holder is claiming that it wasn't their signature and we're told that there is nothing we can do.  She gets her money back and we're screwed, despite having done everything required to protect ourselves.\n\nTheir story is this:  There is a crime ring of maids/house cleaners that have been stealing peoples' credit cards and making unauthorized transactions.  They stole her credit card, her cell phone, and hacked into her email accounts (so she never saw the multiple order emails we sent), then had the items shipped to her house and signed for her.  She claims they have someone in custody.\n\nHer story is pure fiction.  What can I do?  My merchant processor says there is nothing I can do to win, and this loss pretty much cripples us.

I've been looking forward to this for 5 years! I've pretty much used my entire income to pay for their care since they were 8 weeks old and I had to return to work. \n\nIn order to make ends meet instead of paying off my one, low interest credit card every month I've found myself maxing one out then opening and transferring to the next for the introductory benefits. I've done this quite a few times over and now I'm stuck with high interest rates and the subsequent transfer fees. \n\nSo my question is two part, I guess. Since I will soon have my entire income again, should I try and tough this out and pay them off one by one? Or would it make more sense to wipe the slate clean and just stick with one monthly payment on an installment plan? And if the latter is smarter, should I use my big name bank or find a credit union to try to work with? Unfortunately my credit score is sitting at 640 because of the amount of debt I owe and because there have been 3 credit inquiries in the past 2 years from me applying for new credit cards (sigh). I do have 100% history of on time payments and began building credit 20 years ago. \n\nIf I could speak to someone and let them see that I am not actually high risk and that circumstances have just been difficult for me do I have any chance of getting a high amount loan and a good rate?

He strongly disagrees with that decision, not because of the financials, but because he thinks it's unfair that he should go to work all day while I don't.\n\nI feel that over the years I have put in my fair share. I have always carried him in terms of housework and childcare and never nagged  him about it. We don't need the money at this point (our retirement accounts and college savings for both kids are in good shape).

I'm living in my first 'no utilities included' apartment and I just had to get my first propane delivery. Initially when I called, they told me it was going to be $360 for a full tank. I asked if they would do a partial and they put me on hold. After a minute, the woman came back on the line and told me it was actually going to be only $240 for a full tank (and that they won't do partials) because she looked into it and realized it says we have a 120gallon tank on record, when we actually only have a 100 gallon tank. She said they can only fill the tank 80%, so it would be 80 gallons not the full 100 gallons. I told her $240 was fine and gave her the payment information.\n\nToday I see that I was charged $300 by the propane company, not $240. I call up and I get the same woman. She denies ever telling me $240 and says it is $300. I repeat back exactly what she told me and she says I must of misunderstood, $240 must of been the price she gave for a partial. I called her out on and said, \"Well, why would you give me a price for a partial? You put me on hold then told me it wasn't even possible. You never priced a partial.\" She was silent for a second and told me $300 is 'just what it costs', and says that I must of misunderstood. She then said that while we only got 80 gallons, they still charge for a full tank (100 gallons). That to me sounds like a $60 fee.. Is this common practice? If not, can I argue this? My landlord has a contract with the company so I can't even switch.. But I'm really annoyed. What if I didn't have $300 in my account? What if the difference of $60 caused my account to overdraw? I didn't even approve them taking $300 out, only $240. It would be one thing if she apologized for the mistake but she just refused to and said that I was the one who misunderstood.\nTL;DR:"}

He also has several young married friends and cousins, so it's not something he is \"kept away\" from.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Is it ever a good idea to date a coworker? M-24 (me) F-24\nPOST: I've been working at my current office for almost two years.  There are about 20 of us, mostly young, and I have a good relationship with everyone, including my boss/supervisors.  About six weeks ago, an attractive new girl joined us, and we became friends, I like her, you know the drill.  We've flirted a bit but haven't gone out or anything. \n\nMy question is: is this worth pursuing at all?  Or are workplace relationships almost always clusterfucks?  We don't do much work together, but our workspaces are nearby and the office is really damn small.  I would be disappointed to not pursue her, as I really like her, but I get the sense that it just might not be worth.  I know you shouldn't shit where you eat, don't dip the pen in company ink, etc.  However, this is definitely not a career position for me (and probably nor for her), and I know people who have ended up marrying former coworkers.\n\nSo would you guys suggest a \"proceed with caution\" approach or is this more of a \"risks outweigh rewards\" situation?  Also, if this affects the situation, there are many more women at this office than men, so there is less \"competition\" for me I suppose.  Thanks for any input.\nTL;DR:"}

The fedora was being abused by fat losers in order to make them seem superior, and it deserved the hate it got.\n\nThen this stuff hit 4chan. IT became conflated with the term \"neckbeard\", which was originally a term of endearment on /tg/, and became even more of a stereotype. Bronies, Magic players, and the PC Master Race crowd joined this stereotype.\n\nThis is when it went downhill. I'm 150 pounds and don't have a neckbeard, but I got insulted anyway for wearing a trench coat since it was 15 degrees outside, or wearing fingerless gloves to both stay warm and continue using my phone. I can't bear talking about my hobbies anymore since this whole thing started.\n\nAnd then this stuff invaded real life. Recently, a large comic/game store in my area was vandalized. The place was spraypainted with the text \"autism central\" and a poster of a fedora was nailed into the glass. It's been taken care of, but i can't go back to the place ever since this.\n\nAn old friend from childhood posted an image of a Magic card I gave him  some years ago on his Facebook along with the caption \"Turns out my friend was a total autistic neckbeard\". \n\nLook, being a douche to religious people like /r/atheism or a sexist like /r/theredpill is a problem. But insulting people for their hobbies, vandalising game stores, and using \"autism\" as a callous insult makes you look like a huge douche.Same with the whole \"m'lady\" thing.

Fast forward to July 4th and I still did not talk to her much there.  Then a few weeks later, talking to her online on top of taking her to the Batman Trilogy, I felt like we hit it off.  I sat next to her as it was with the mutual friend and his GF.\n\nAnyway, from there, we talked online more frequently, conversations weren't meaningful to be honest but I started hanging out with her more since the beginning of August.  It all started with my friend's birthday where I took her to the zoo.  I learned that she is having surgery soon on top of closing on a house by the end of the month.  About once-twice a week I hung out with her albeit with the mutual friend couple.  I took her to the mall, underwater aquarium, and the park there within the mall.  \n\nThe week before her surgery and House closing, I asked her out on a 'date' to see Paranorman.  I pair for everything, movie, snacks, and an appetizer at the end.  Then she moved and I helped her out those three days before her surgery.  While she was gone I offered to visit but we both agreed upon not doing it.  I took care of her pets the next few days.  When she came back she called me up to hang out to keep her company.  From there, she has called me back multiple times to come up and hang out.  I have been making sure she is eating and showing some infatuation like rubbing her hand and touching her a little more as in a flirtatious style.  I have planned to keep her company the last few days and the next couple days from what I can tell and making sure she is taken care of.\n\nWhat I want to know is am I going too far/doing too much?  We aren't dating but we have jokingly said comments about bf/gf's on top of marriage as well for the future.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not in love with the guy or anything but he seems really awesome and I could definitely see it going somewhere. \n\nSo my question is basically what should I do about my FWB? We've been continuing to hooked up as I've been on multiple dates before that didn't work out and I'm clearly not exclusive with the tinder guy, but regularly hooking up with someone on the side now that things seem promising feels a little \"iffy.\" But if I'm going to be having sex with other people, doesn't it make sense to be with someone I know and is safe? I guess I'm just asking at what point do I stop hooking up with my FWB.\n\nAlso, even if we stop hooking up, and can't see us not being friends.

We did not talk for three weeks but when I came home for spring break last weekend I sent her a text asking how she was doing and she said we should go out for breakfast the next morning.  We went and she repeatedly told me how much she missed me and that she didn't realize how much I meant to her.  She kept apologizing for breaking up with me and telling me that she doesn't know what she was thinking.  We saw a friend from high school who knew we broke up and she said \"Do you think we should tell her?\" which kind of confused me because i didn't know what it was that we should maybe tell her.  Our relationship seemed on fire and fresh.  She also told me that the guy I thought she was cheating on me with, which catalyzed our breakup, told her that he liked her and she told him that she only liked him as a friend.  We hung out again a few days later and everything still seemed great.  Over the past couple of days she has not texted me much and when we hung out lastnight and she ignored me and napped for most of the night and did not seem nearly as affectionate as the previous two times. Do you think after seeing me a few times she stopped missing me and realized she wanted to stay broken up? I'm really confused as to what I should do. Should I just move on and pretend that we are still broken up or ask her what she thinks of our relationship or just hangout with her a few more times and go with the flow.

She even blurted out randomly that she wants me to like her and flirt with her, which I thought was amazingly cute the way she did it.\n\nAfter a couple of days, I brought up the discussion of when to meet, and she didn't know when. I suggest next weekend (a week from then) and she declines. I don't pressure her, assuming she may need to talk to me for a few more days before she decides. That same day she says we could meet next weekend if she could bring a friend.\n\nI told her I'm uncomfortable with that. Through the resulting conversations, I now have a less than stellar impression of her. While she changed the details of her story several time, the basic story right now is that she wants to bring her friend for safety, although I highly suspect it's mostly for support. I have suggested meeting at day time, in a crowded place, and that she could even drive us or meet me wherever we decide to go. Declined. I suggested doing something on her university's campus. Declined. She has stated that I don't even have to meet her friend, just that her friend be somewhere nearby. The thought of having someone there watching us or whatever is even more disturbing to me.\n\nIt's not just her wanting to bring a friend along, it's the fact that she couldn't tell me straight up the exact reason she wanted to bring someone along (she initially made it sound like her friends/parents were forcing her to bring someone) and that she's apparently cripplingly shy.\n\nI'm generally skeptical of younger girls that have not been in college for very long.

We did the long-distance thing for a few months before I packed everything up, quit my job and moved out to start my life with her in France.

It wasn't working; after 8 months I left to continue working in the UK.\n\nThe last two months of trying the long-distance have been hell. We'd been fighting non-stop, she started getting major trust issues and generally things fell apart. I'd also been getting chestpains and my digestion had been awful since I've gotten back.

These 4 days were too much for me and I ended it.\n\nI realised that all this hurt, stress and unhappiness wasn't worth the relationship. I love her. She's still my world.

She honestly didn't do anything to change our situation, but she at least said she wanted it to. She then felt it necessary to tell me how much her and her ex and sex even though I didn't ask. It was WAY more then she ever had sex with me. She got mad that I cared. It crushed me. Don't get me wrong, no one should ever have sex with someone if they don't want to, but I'm not sure what's worse to think about; that she wanted him more or that she was willing to more to make sure he was happy. \n\nI asked her to try initiating sex more since I now had zero confidence. Sex not only didn't happen anymore often, but her idea of initiating sex on occasion was getting in bed and saying, \"I think we should have sex.\"  I think?! She doesn't know?

About a week ago my wife says that this just isn't working as her back is hurting very badly, as is mine. \nSo we go to the store and tell the rep who sold us the mattress that we need to return it and he showed us the mattress he sold us and it was the completely wrong one! The softness level difference was about 4 notches lower on the one he sold us. He points out that the name of the mattress he sold us is on the form we signed, but how was I supposed to know the name of the mattress? \nSo all I want at this point is to get the mattress we originally wanted with the same 100 day trial period as we are still wary of temperpedic mattresses but the rep says all he can do is exchange out the mattress and maybe get a 30 day extension approved. My wife being cautious of temperpedic mattresses now wants to go with a pillowtop mattress which I reluctantly agree to and we signed the form for the exchange. \nSo /r/legaladvice do I have a case here? I know I signed the form that showed the wrong mattress name but the rep kept pointing to the right mattress.\nTL;DR:"}

We've met each others' family, etc., so it's pretty serious.\n\nRecently, one of my friends [also 26M] mentioned that he saw my girlfriend on said online dating site and said that she's been active within the last week and apparently does log in at least weekly. He showed me using his profile and he's telling the truth.\n\nIt's kind of a touchy subject for me because I was cheated on in a really bad way in my past, which my GF is aware of, and it makes me uncomfortable.

He's probably right. \n\nNeither of us have dated or been with other people. We spend a lot of our time together and we have a lot of the same friends.

He asks about guy friends sometimes and whether or not I could see myself with them like we're best girl friends. I think he's jealous but I think he would be relieved if I began seeing somebody because then he could stop feeling guilty about holding me back. He says I'm too good for him and sometime it'll occur to me that I've been fooling myself into thinking he's a good person worth caring about. He says if he was going to be with anyone, it would be me, but it's never going to happen, so I should be thinking about my future with other guys. Then other times he kisses my nose and tells me I'm pretty. I couldn't accuse him of sending me mixed signals because he'd never mean to be cruel.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Parallel Universe mind loop\nPOST: Recently I have been revising for my Physics exam so when I've been taking a break I've been watching physics related videos on YouTube which lead me onto one about the theory of parallel Universes, which got me thinking. In the video they said about how the interaction between particles would spark of into separate 'branches' where in one branch they interacted and the other they didn't thus creating an infinite amount of branches over time, and in each of these 'parallel universes' they laws of physics as well as laws of everything else are slightly different where in out universe pi=3.14 but in another if could equal 2 or even 45, which made me think of the idea that in one of these universes the concept of parallel universes would be impossible (if there is an infinite amount of universes then one must have this concept) then if this was the case, then that would make the whole concept of this impossible, as if one of the universes has the laws of physics saying its impossible, then it has to be impossible in every other one, rendering them all incorrect and whole concept implodes on itself...\nTL;DR:"}

It's pretty casual. He recently talked to me about wanting to keep it casual and a fwb situation but also that he felt I was pretty distant, cold and unaffectionate. I apologized and explained it is just the way I am and it isn't because I don't like him or anything like that. I countered that I would be willing to make an effort to change. I reasoned that I wouldn't be doing it just for him because this has been an ongoing problem with a lot of people, past relationships in my life - that I'm distant and emotionally unavailable. \n\nAt the time, he said he would have to think about it. I thought definitely he was ending things but he seems to want to give it another go. The question is what do I do now? I said I would make an effort but I come from a household where screaming was a show of affection. I don't even know where to begin. How does one show affection? \n\nTo further complicate, I'm not really sure what the boundaries are for casual/fwb relationships. I mean, I'd like to kiss him when I see him, but do you do that with someone you're just seeing for hooking up? I mean, a large part of why I've been so distant with him is because I thought we were just casual hooking up partners. I don't know if I should be more affectionate and foster more of a connection with someone when we both want a casual deal. \n\nAm I thinking too much into this?

I hope you're all having a great day. \nI'll try and keep this as simple as possible. Been with my S/O for just short of 18 months. She is my world, since we got serious I have always saw us being together through life and I can't really imagine how I would live properly without her around.\nWe would usually spend a few days a week together, we don't live together but we would stay over at each others houses and it was all great. Recently she started working very long hours, 10-12 hours a day and 5 days a week. Obviously this is difficult, that's understandable. However, the problem I'm having is it leaves very little time for us to see eachother. I expected to have every weekend together however it's not that simple. She is very tired after work so I can't come to see her weekdays, and she is out of the house at around 6:30 am and it is inconvenient for me to be at her house all day without her. She said that she does want a social life with her work friends as she will be stuck with them for at least 2 years. We can't move in with eachother yet as we do not make enough to get by with rent and bills comfortably. Neither of us drive yet but she is close getting a license which will help. \nWhat does this all mean? Well, she's going to be going out on work nights out every few weeks, which means I won't be able to see her, then she has assignments to do over other weekends which means I may not be able to spend the day with her. It could be as little as once a day every 2 weeks.\n\nLike I said at the start, I don't want this to be over. I'm willing to make sacrifices if she is too. I just want to know if anyone has any advice on how I can make this easier for both of us? I really need help here and it is on my mind constantly and its emotionally hurting me. Any advice will help, positive or negative. \n\nSorry about the long post folks!\nTL;DR:"}

He would do the middle school flirting like throwing things at me, poking me, playing with my jacket etc. He also wouldn't move when I leaned in on him.

I asked him, and he said no and apologized if I led him on and that he really does like me as a friend. I think that this *might* have to do with him being HEAVILY focused on school and puts all of his energy towards it. (makes him more attractive). I'm wondering, if maybe I should keep that in mind and put him on the back burner.

I want him to hang out with me because he wants to see me, not because he feels obligated. And as I said, I'm really happy with the amount of time we are spending together.

I have been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years now. Sometimes if I am upset about something he holds me down and I HATE it. For context, he is bigger than I am and no matter how much I struggle I cannot get free. It really bothers me and makes me feel very helpless, and I end up angrier than ever. He says he does it because I am angry, but the thing that really pisses me off is him holding me down. (If you need the full story, I'll explain, but it's very long)\n\nI asked him point blank \"So if I am upset and want to walk away you're going to hold me down?\" and he said yes - even though he knows how much I hate it. This happened tonight, but isn't the first time he's held me down like this, and I have told him before I **really** don't like it. \n\nHe claims I am crazy for getting so angry... Is he right?\nTL;DR:"}

Please be patient to read this tangle of thorns...\n\nWe had dated nearly 2 years between 2008 and 2010, then broke up in May 2010, got back together again, and dated for a another year.  We then broke up in April of 2011, then spent all of last summer hooking up every couple of weeks (very low and embarrassing, felt really used, but wanted to be with him).\n\nFall 2011 came around and we hooked up a couple times, then I found out he was sleeping with a mutual friend of ours.  I flipped out, cut contact and didn't really speak to him from October until December, until he contacted me around Christmas.\n\nFrom December to January we spent a considerable amount of time together, almost hooked up, but by that time, I had started casually seeing another boy, and I didn't feel comfortable giving into the ex.  He found out I was seeing someone else, and it was his turn to flip his shit.\n\nSince February, things have been very awkward between the two of us.  He goes weeks without speaking to me, and then contacts me out of the blue.  I break No Contact and then feel miserable for doing so. \n\nI know that No Contact is the best option but I feel so weak.  He is a lousy boyfriend and things just haven't worked out and I'm dating a new guy at the moment and he is wonderful.  But I am still in love with my ex (not the person he has become, but the boy I fell in love with).\nTL;DR:"}

We have been dating for about 2 years now and it is her first REAL relationship. I took her virginity. I have had only one other relationship lasting longer than a year but I have had many other flings and short time gfs which she has not. We have come to the point where we are not infatuated with each other anymore. I love her. She loves me. But it doesn't feel like it used to. We are VERY different. She is religious. I am not. She likes fashion, nice things and traveling. I like outdoors activities, beer and simpler things. (There are many other differences) I feel like the magic is just wearing off and we are (or at least I am) starting to see how different we are. She is a great girl. Very nice and pleasant. 8/10. Well off, money wise and just an all around catch. But, not the catch for me. My question is..  Is it worth it to break up and try and find perfect partners or should I stay with her because she does have so many great qualities even though a lot of our ways are different?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: I'm (19m) not sure if I should seek another chance with my now ex.\nPOST: I've known this girl for a year and a half now. A year of that time we were dating. There was a point in the relationship where I left the country for two weeks so we had pretty much no contact. During that time she took a liking for her male best friend. She broke up with me and went out with him for a month, maybe a little less. And then came back to me and asked for forgiveness and all that jazz.\n\n After about 2 weeks, we started dating again. Everything was great. Obviously I didn't really want her talking to him but one day I saw that she was. I confronted her and she apologized and said she wouldn't do it anymore. Yet, it happened again about two days ago.\n\n The reason I ask if I should seek another chance is because, the main reason she broke up with me was because she's asked me to change a couple of times and I never really did. She wanted me to stop being so selfish, to be more mature and not joke about everything, she wanted me to treat her more like a gf than a regular friend, and she wanted me to be more affectionate. \n\nAnd the reason I brought up what happened with the guy was because the second time she was talking to him, I called her out on it and told her it's either me or him. She said she couldn't choose. The next day she tells me it's just not going to work between us because of how I am and how I haven't shown any effort to change for her. I feel like her and I aren't done yet, we have so much in common, the connection we have is incredible and she really can be a great girlfriend and all.\nTL;DR:"}

We are in an LDR and have met but haven't had sex yet. Just coz we want to wait, no religious reasons. \nOver the course of our relationship we've had all differences but worked through them. My main issue with him is when we have even a small argument, he shuts down completely.

We also had quite a few arguments and as usual he hasn't talked much. In an LDR, this is unbelievably frustrating. And we've had arguments about that too. \n\nNow onto the problem, he opened up to me and texted that he was feeling very depressed. After a few texts he told me that he hasn't been able to sleep properly this week and I told him that I was telling the same thing about myself to my friend this morning. He shut down immediately and said he was glad I have someone to talk to. I told him I want him to talk to me. After that he asked me why I was marrying him. I told him I love him and other stuff and ended with you're perfect for me. To that his reply was this and I'm paraphrasing. \nThing is I don't know if we are perfect for each other. I'm stubborn and independent and very private. You're stubborn as well but not as private.

The issue with this was that he said they *would* make a page, and didn't see an incoming shitstorm.\n After class while we were getting ready to leave, my friend said it would be an awesome idea to make a page before they did, and I somewhat agreed. Of course, at the time, I wasn't actually planning on doing it; I decided to after said friend pestered me about it. I had it all set up, I made a new Email and Facebook account, then proceeded to create the page, schedule a post for the morning, and share it around; it helped that the school never officially made a page.\n I woke up in the morning, and just stayed home, waiting for the event to pan out - the post had already been seen by a good fifty people by around 7:00; this escalated to almost 2,000 views, and around 40 shares in an hour, with multiple comments on the page from people spreading it around. I didn't really expect this, it was just going to be a harmless joke, and it became something.\n This Monday, I came to school and was instantly swarmed by the type of people you would view as spiteful dicks, making sarcastic comments and questioning or congratulating me - I was escorted to the office before I could even get to first period, and was questioned - I probably would've been fine, too, considering they seemed rather simple. The next day, I was escorted again and was outright told they thought it was me, and that my 'friend' had confirmed it for them.

We got in a huge fight about it at the time, and even though I didn't tell him specifically not to go, I made it very apparent how much it upset me. He ended up going despite knowing how mad I was about it, and then apologized a shit load after when he realized how serious I was about being mad. \n\nNow, this was a few months ago so it's basically over now, but sometimes I just think about that day and how upset I was and I just get so angry about it all.

I am terribly afraid of spiders (who isn't?) so to my relief I realized it wasn't a spider but a rather large crab. The house had a serious, serious crab infestation, and a bunch of people I know (friends, family, ect.) began pulling out crabs from everywhere. It was at first kind of fun, but soon got kind of strange. Then my French teacher arrived dressed in green, and after talking for a bit I began to feel sick. At this point I realized there were crabs everywhere, crawling on people's faces, dropping from the ceiling - I mean everywhere. I ran to the bathroom, now sick to my stomach, and ran straight back out (due, of course, to the fact that the bathroom was full of massive crabs). Curling up in the hallway in blinding pain, I then began to feel crabs crawling out of my mouth.

There is no cure for this disease -- and the best way I can explain is that the blood vessels in her lungs are so closed off that they cannot (without medication) provide oxygen to the rest of the body. They major side effect of this is that the heart will pump extra hard to provide oxygen to the rest of the body -- which slowly enlarges and kills the heart. My mom has been in the CICU 3 times since 2006 and has always bounced back -- her medication that helps her lungs is close to $20,000 a month (it's a pump that provides medication through her body). The outlook for this disease is very grim -- and the end all is either death (eventually, as it wears out the body) or an attempt at a lung and heart transplant (which is just as dangerous).

I found out about it though, he didn't tell me.\n\nI on the other hand once went on a date with an old man for $150. I was living with my bf at the time.

I told him when I was in the hospital like a month later.\n\nHe says I'm the cheater, not him, but that he was wrong and that he would prove his loyalty to me.

We were supposed to go to hike and enjoy the outdoors. The place we stayed had two canoes, so 4 of us (3 girls and one guy) decided to take one of the canoes, (and a beer) out on the lake. Wasn't great conditions out, pretty grey and windy, which should have been our first clue. As we were in the canoe, one of our friends on shore noticed that there was a hole in the bow of the canoe. We went with the \"ehhhhh, no biggie!\" response and decided to paddle out to the middle of the lake. As we were canoeing, the guy, who sat at the back of the canoe, started to notice the canoe taking on water. We were nearly at the island when our friend tells us that she can't swim. As she is telling us this, the canoe sinks. We go down, each of us is wearing tons of layers and the water is freezing cold. Our male friend and I then have to tow the canoe to the island with other friends who weren't strong swimmers. We then stripped down and prayed to Yeezy that our friends back at the cabin saw us go down and called for help. We ended sitting on the island naked for 90 minutes until a rescue boat came to get us. Thankfully no one got hypothermia. We also made it to the daily news. \n\nSadly the beer was never recovered\nTL;DR:"}

I made a career change last year with a lot of trepidation. I had lost touch with all friends, put on some weight, and was extremely depressed. I had a lot of anxiety as I transitioned into my new career path, unsure if I truly wanted to go in this direction.\n\nWe met in this new career field. She was nice and we chatted in the beginning. I was so depressed at the time that this interaction really pulled me out of my funk. Fast forward through the year. We have many things in common, but also many things that aren't. She is a very religious Christian; I'm agnostic. She has many friends from around the world; I can count my friends on my two hands. I think she was attracted to me a little until she found out that I was agnostic. While still friendly, I could sense this was the beginning of the end. I eventually told her that I liked her and she very openly said that she was not interested. \n\nThat's cool, I understand. It just wasn't meant to be, whether religion was the factor or not. I thought I could just rationally get over this but it hasn't been easy. I climbed out of my depression after meeting her and yet I can feel myself falling back into it. My self-worth is beginning to crumble again even though I know I shouldn't base it off this one failed crush.

Now our problem is that she implemented a list with all the jobs that have to be completed on a shift to shift basis and once you complete an assignment you initial a little box next to it on the list. The list has been a pretty good indicator of who's actually doing what kinds of work and to what degree, creating a system of accountability I guess. \n\nHowever, Karen takes this list **very** seriously, and has been hounding people for uncompleted or mismanaged tasks. She's addressing these problems in a very uhhh, unorthodox way, and instead of singling out individuals and talking to them in the store or giving them a call, she sends a group text message to all my coworkers and I. Most of the time these messages are really directed at one or two people, but she feels the need to tell **everybody** that someone left an unwashed pizza tray in the back room sink or that the person who accepted the deliveries from the night before forgot to put them away. \n\nAccounting for the past three weeks, Karen has sent over **fifty** of these group messages, many of them have accompanying photos of the problems, which takes a fair chunk out of my monthly one gig of data. \n\nMorale is down big time in the store because almost all of these messages are just about problems and they come on a constant basis.

The complete truth is that I have had immense feelings for my best friend for almost 5 months now and it's only getting stronger each day. She doesn't know this. No one knows this because I am \"straight\". I have no idea what to do and it's destroying our friendship. She's scared I'll push her away and I'm scared of the same. I'm scared because I know things will not be the same. When I think about them together, it makes me angry when I know she cares about someone who isn't me. Telling her I have feelings for her is NOT option. So I'm asking, what should I do to help cope with this without ruining our friendship?\nTL;DR:"}

We broke up a few years ago due to distance as we were attending different universities.  I have unfortunately redeveloped feelings for her.  I have made these feelings known to her, and right now she said she would like to remain friends and continue to get closer.  \n\nSo here is the confusing part, I currently live in the city where I attended school and she lives in our hometown.  I am extremely unhappy with where I am in life due to career issues and am becoming homesick.  I don't have a lot of friends left here because everyone has moved for work, or is still in school and doesn't have the same priorities that I do.  I have considering moving back to the hometown and finding other employment.  Now that me and her are in contact again, I am afraid that is influencing my decision greatly even though I'm unsure of where our relationship will go.  So I guess my question to you guys is, how do you know what you are supposed to do?  How do you know what the right life choice for you is?  How do you know if you're supposed to be in the right place at the right time for someone?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by not taking care of myself for a few months.\nPOST: This fuck up began about 2 months ago, when I managed to get myself my first job. I thought it was going to be an easy job, just stacking shelves. Boy was I wrong, I have to do almost everything in the store except heavy cleaning. My hours are at strange times and I'm worked very hard. I normally cycle to work which is about 5 kilometers away, all this exercise and strenuous work began to take its affect, without me even knowing it.\n\nFast forward to earlier today. I had stayed at my girlfriends flat in Edinburgh overnight. We were on our way to the train station so I could go home. But an interesting thing to note about myself is that if my blood sugar is low, I feel like absolute shit. It happens all the time and eating some high calorie food normally perks me right up. And so on this delightful morning on our way to the train station I began to feel pretty bad. So i stopped at a small bakery and had a doughnut and a slice of pizza. Just as I was leaving the bakery my body suddenly had a large spasm and I got a little bit of a fright. But I brushed it off and kept walking. We passed the iconic Greyfriars Bobby and that's the last thing I remember. I woke up in the middle of the road with my girlfriend crying and a paramedic looming over me. I was very confused. He then informed me that I had taken a seizure in the middle of the road. And I, in my state of confusion and hunger asked where my pizza was, trust me to be that guy. I was taken to the hospital and I waited for the usual NHS waiting times and was eventually told that they didn't know what happened to me, but they think it was my low blood sugar.\n\nThis is where my work comes into play. Apparently I have been pushing my body too hard. Going without breakfast and lots of vigorous exercise had led to my body crashing after one night of no sleep  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)    and hardly any food. So there's a lesson for all you other lazy people out there, always make sure you are eating and taking care of your body.\nTL;DR:"}

Here is a link to the site so I don't have to explain too much for those of you who are not familiar:   \nIt's basically a long ass, very difficult, obstacle course.  \n Anyways, she told them last night and today her manager told her about how when the manager and other employees went out to dinner the night before, they talked about how she wouldn't be able to do it and that she should not even attempt it.  They ridiculed her and this type of behavior from these women is not out of the ordinary from other stories my girlfriend has told me.  She told me this upset her and made her second guess whether she should do it or not...\n This upset me.  Basically, I gave her multiple reason to dismiss their opinions and to respectfully tell them to go fuck themselves.  \n These women, who have never attempted this event nor any difficult race for that matter, are perfect examples of people who truly have never challenged themselves to do something far outside of there comfort zone.  They are examples of people who hate the fact that someone else is challenging themselves and believes they can do something that is out of the ordinary.  I have run into many people like this and a reoccurring theme I see with them is the pleasure they seek is not in the work or effort they put into something but the pleasure they will have from the party and the drinking they will do when the work week is over.  \n I am sharing this story as a warning to others that when they are confronted with beings of this nature that at least mentally, they should tell them to fuck off with their opinions, because they have no value and they distract you from your goals because they don't want you to achieve them, because they never believed they could either.\nTL;DR:"}

We moved across the country and have lived together for over a year. We've gotten over the usual post-honeymoon phase nitpicks and living together complaints. However, for the past 6 months or so, I have been feeling a real lack of affection. Yeah, since our first year together frequency of sex, cuddling, etc has decreased, but even more so over the past 6 months. What is compounding my frustration is the fact that when I bring up the topic for discussion, he seems to dismiss it as something that is solely my problem, and my problem alone. He states that he is satisfied. When I express frustration in his lack of wanting to understand, show compassion, or figure out where the gap is, he again dismisses my feelings. It seems we have the same conversation every few weeks and the conversations yield no results except me giving up.\n\nIs there a different approach I can take to discussing my needs v. his needs? Is it unreasonable to request a bit more attention to staying a relatively affectionate couple?\nTL;DR:"}

How to stop caring about having your heart broken?\nPOST: So I am here to ask two things really: \n\n1. How do you learn to TRUST? I mean, young love rarely ever lasts, it's almost like people go in just for the experience. For example my last relationship, I went in there deliberately trying to just keep everything light and fun, and not get too emotionally attached (as a rule, I find emotional attachment to people is dangerous and compromises your goals, self-control and resilience. Or love makes you weak.) Unfortunately I fell in love, that made me weak, then I got my heart-broken. I forgot how social interaction leaves you prone to vulnerability, I was foolish, I will keep myself distanced in future. \n\n2. How do you actually get to the point where you literally do not give a SHIT if your partner walks away? I'm talking you've been with them for 5 years, you're about to propose, but if they dump you tomorrow you'll just suck it up over a few beers and move on the next day. Once they say No you walk away and it's like they never existed. No sense of loss, no heartache, no self-pitying crying or whatever, just eh it happens, that's life innit. \n\nI want to be THAT strong because I believe that is the only way. At least until I am 25. (I have no faith in 'true love' before the age of 25)\n\nBasically I want to be hardened to the point that I just say hey, I die, you die, he got divorced, she cheated on him, they broke up after 20 years, shit happens, everyone leaves, we move forward. So that my fiancee can give me a breakup talk and I'm just like 'Hey that's cool, nice knowing you, good luck and that'.\nTL;DR:"}

This wasn't such a big deal with other children who at that age (They were around 8 when the incident at hand occurred.) were relatively chill as far as kids go and accepted her as their friend just like everybody else.\n\nHowever, there was this one boy Simon who thought he was hilarious, generally making rude remarks and telling everyone who would listen that Judith was a dirty nigger and that my father was a nigger lover.

Mostly scared I guess.\n\nSince I couldn't commit to him, I went off and did my own thing (talking / seeing other people).  We never stopped talking though. He was my best friend at the time so we kept in constant communication. After I hurt him (by seeing other people and always talking to him) he went off and did his own thing. In that time he hooked up with TONS of people. We weren't talking at the time, so it wasn't too big a deal.\n\nBy the end of high school we finally got together. Now I love him to death and I know I can see a future in us, but it has been very difficult for us to get over the fact that we hooked up with different people (especially who those people where; since we went to school with them they were usually friends) when we could have just been together from the start.\n\nFor those of you wondering, I have loved him since grade 10 but I find this very hard to explain. I was scared by the fact that I knew he was the one for me. I didn't want to get into a relationship at the time because I was confused by my feelings. Did I value him as a friend more, or would it ruin our friendship if I got into the relationship.. the typical high school issues.\n\nMy relationship is strong, we communicate very well and often. But we have been talking about this issue for a couple months now. Saying how we both got hurt. In all honesty, I did worse to him then he did to me...by far. It seems that talking about what happen always tends to end up with tears and heartache, or if we don't talk about it its the elephant in the room. It seems to not get any better with time and talking about it.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is if anyone else has had a similar experience where they can't seem to find a way to forget / forgive the past.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [Tennessee] Question about including managers in tip pooling.\nPOST: I'm a manager at a small locally-owned restaurant that is one of 3 in a local chain. Our setup is a bit like a Moe's or Chipotle, in that you start at one end of a line of food and instruct a clerk on what you'd like on your burrito, tacos, quesadilla, etc. We have a tip jar by the register and at the end of the shift, tips are distributed evenly 100% among the staff. We are not a full service restaurant, but our particular branch prides itself on its service so we are very friendly and sociable with our customers and even after they've paid and sat down we'll come out from behind the line to check on their meal, offer refills, and clear finished plates and dishes.\n\nNo one is paid server wages, and indeed everyone's hourly rate is well above minimum wage, and with tip pooling you're probably gonna leave a shift with at least $20 cash in your pocket.\n\nThe problem is that up until our regional manager started looking into tip pooling rules after finding out about the class action suit against Starbucks a few years back, managers were included in the tip pool. This never struck anyone as unfair because the managers have the exact same duties as the regular clerks. We don't have an office or kitchen to retreat to until we're needed, we're on the line making food and serving customers as much (if not moreso) than a non-manager. But because we're no longer a part of the tip pool, the clerks are now making profoundly more money per shift than the managers. And obviously this isn't sitting well with any of us. Suddenly we're getting paid way less for the same job that someone else is getting paid more to do, and without the added responsibility of being a manager.\n\nMy question is, is there a legal way we can still participate in these pools? The owner seems unwilling to raise our hourly rate to make up for the difference. As the de facto head manager, I've done all I can to try to placate my staff and get them to hang on but I fear for a mass exodus if a solution can't be found.\nTL;DR:"}

When I picked her up she was still saying these things and when I insisted, \"You do love daddy! Stop saying that!\" she got even more furious.

Help please\nPOST: hey everyone, I need some advice on what could I do in my situation that I think is pretty strange. I've know this freshman student athlete since last semester. I really liked her and still do. We went out a couple of time last semester and on Christmas, she I got her a present and she got me one too. I was heading to the airport because I was going back to Europe during the break. We exchanged presents, and I kissed her goodbye on her lips and left. She blushed so hard, didn't say a word. She then turned back while all red and waived goodbye. \n\nWe texted all break, she even wished me happy newyear. Here is where the change started. 10 days ago she stopped replying to my whatsapp massages \" I was still overseas\". I can see her online on other social media apps but she hasn't been online on whatsapp since then. I came back to the US yesterday, and notified everone via text that I am here, including her.. She didn't reply. I called her after class today to say Hi, she didn't pick up or return my call.What happened? I didn't do anything wrong. I know that she is a student athlete and now is her season of competitions but why is she ignoring completely after acting interested at first, I gave her soo many hints in person and via text that I like her also and told her that I want to get to know her even more. I am really pissed for her ignoring me and I am thinking of sending her a final text to confront her because I can't stand being ignored like that, I feel very offended because it happened all of a sudden.\n\n I will text her on how childish and pointless her behavior is and that I was expecting it from someone like her. Then I got her massage of ignoring me and I tell her that it was nice to know her. Do you guys think this is a good idea? I am not really expecting her to reply to it, but I just want to say whats in my heart because I can't stand being ignored like this/ Do you guys think that this is a bad idea and will make me look desperate of something?

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How to get over anxiety while performing oral on my partner?\nPOST: I [F22] have been in a relationship now for a 6 months with an amazing guy [M22]. This is my first relationship post-depression and I've noticed that I become extremely submissive in bed, when before my depression I wasn't. I get anxiety at the thought of giving my current partner oral, etc., when this was never a problem for me with my past partners before I had my depression. \n\nI've been thinking that maybe that fact that he is uncircumsized is something that throws me off? The first few times we had sex I (stupidly) didn't notice and pulled too hard on his foreskin, causing him some discomfort. It may be a factor that scarred me/gave me anxiety to further any oral with him. I have given him oral a few times despite my anxiety however it is brief. \n\nI have had zero bad thoughts/signs of depression for about 1 year. However, this anxiety that gets to me is something new that I'm experiencing and I don't understand why I have it. Is there any way to get over this? I literally freeze up while in bed and although I'm open with my partner about this situation he doesn't seem to mind too much. But deep down I feel awful and I want to change this situation because I really like him, I want to pleasure him because he deserves it. But this anxiety is a little bitch and is stopping me.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel like I always initiate conversation, kissing, and any other physical contact.  Even though he says he likes me, it feels like he actually doesn't, and he's just too nice of a guy to turn me down. \n\n Furthermore, I wish we could just hang out alone instead of in a group because I'd really like to get to know him in a more intimate setting , but I'm afraid to ask.   \n\nI really don't know what to do.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What are some gentle ways to help an open-minded Creationist learn more about Evolution?\nPOST: Hey Reddit, first date with a Derpina last night.  The conversation was going great, until religion came up--she believes in Intelligent Design.\n\nI dug a little deeper: turns out she went to a Lutheran high school, where she said \"they taught us about evolution, and then they taught us why it's wrong\".  That was her only exposure to evolution, ever, so she maintains some strong doubts (e.g.: she believes that the oldest rocks on Earth are only 150,000 years old, therefore the fossil record is meaningless, therefore evolution is just a theory).  However, she's aware of the bias of her teachers, so she is very open to learning more, she just doesn't know where to start.\n\nSo are there any good websites or books that explain evolution in an non-confrontational way, that would allow her to gently realize that she was lied to in high school without feeling like her beliefs are being attacked?  I don't want to be on the offensive with this, since we've only had one date.  \n\nFor the record, closed-minded creationism would probably be a dealbreaker for me, but since she is so open-minded about it, I'd like to give it a shot.\nTL;DR:"}

I was kind of blindsided, but see that it needed to happen. Our relationship was not unhealthy, in fact it was very healthy, we are just different people with different expectations and want different lifestyles. We are both hurting right now but I know we will both be okay.  \n\nThe problem is that we share an apartment until the end of summer (in one of the most expensive cities in the US, if not the most expensive). The lucky thing is that we have access to another, smaller, space we can use. Neither of us want to move there full time and I don't think should have to if the arrangement we have agreed to works out. We have decided to alternate btw the smaller space and our shared apartment for the time being.\n\nI really, really love this man and he really loves me, we just are not the best match for one another. I usually go no contact immediately with exboyfriends, but harbor no bad feelings or ill will towards him, we are both still pretty sad though but think we can be friends eventually. I have seen him twice since he 'moved out' for him to come pick stuff he needs up, I cried really hard the last time he left and so did he (the hardest either of us have cried since this happened). I am traveling a lot in the next 2 months, hence being unable to find a permanent apartment right now, he also cannot afford our shared space on his own (I am not legally tied to the apartment). \n\nAny suggestions on how to navigate this situation? We have already set ground rules on when we are switching, who can and cannot stop by (i.e. if either of us begin to sleep w anyone which I don't think is going to happen anytime soon, he seemed surprised i brought this up), cleanliness etc. Ideally, I would like to use this time to transition our relationship into a friendship but have no idea how to. We have mostly only been talking about apartment stuff but this is still fresh so occasionally the conversations veer into what went wrong, etc; which I am okay with as well.\nTL;DR:"}

What to do?\nPOST: I was let go from my last full-time job in October, and while I've acquired part-time work since I've been looking for something to supplement it.  Last week I had some job interviews.  The first of them was for a contract-to-hire position, through a recruiting agency, working at a well-established but not well-liked company nearby, doing work I'm not sure if I'd actually like.  Unexpectedly, the job interview went well and they offered me the job later that day, to start around two weeks later.  At the time I heard about this, I had other interviews coming up with places I had already been in touch with for longer - one in particular for a direct hire position at a smaller company - and was more interested in them, so I told the recruiter I would give him a final answer at the end of the week.\n\nSo the end of the week comes, and I had those further interviews, but was told I wouldn't get a definite answer from either of them until early next week.  Not wanting to lose the first offer completely and thinking it was still better than not working at all, I told the recruiter I would accept the offer, and signed off on the paperwork.  However, one of the following interviews gave me an offer as well, one that's offering a more interesting job, better pay, and what looks like a better work environment.  I think I'd be much happier with the second job, and plan to view their offer letter in detail when it was prepared tomorrow morning.\n\nNow the question is, should I be concerned about burning bridges with the first job, the one that I'm prepared to withdraw from the job before even starting?  Is there a way I can do this without any hard feelings and without this potentially biting me back later?\nTL;DR:"}

With this kind of change, I've had to learn how to manage my managers, how to advocate for what I believed was right.  And most importantly, how to get them to support my career even after they moved on.\n\nThe simple fact is; Gen X and Millenials don't stay tied down very long and if you want to grow your own career you can't rely on your boss to do so, even the good ones.

He has missed out on a lot in her life so far because sitting at home on the computer is more fun I guess. \n\nHe picks and chooses when he wants to do stuff with her. I know he loves her and loves spending time with her, he takes her to parks, he'll do her homework with her, he cuddles with her and will watch movies, but sometimes he refuses to do stuff that's kind of important, just because he doesn't want to.\n\nHe has never been to a school concert, event or conference. If we go do something, he won't go unless it's what he wants to do (which is usually just fishing). Last summer we went to museums and amusement parks, and he refused to go. He won't go to her sporting events or practices. \n\nAll of this constantly has me thinking about the future. All of her friends are in Girl Scouts, and I won't sign her up because I know he will never go to their annual daddy/daughter dinners. And he won't go to her high school graduation. He won't see her off at college. If she chooses to get married and have a traditional ceremony, he won't walk her down the isle, or even show up to her wedding. \n\nHonestly, I almost want to divorce him over it so I can move on and find someone who will do all these things with us. I've told him that it bothers me, and he just doesn't care. I have raging anxiety to the point where I can't even look people in the eye, but I go to every school event and take our daughter to do activities.\n\nPart of me feels like I'm being overdramatic about it, but the other half keeps saying \"no, this is bullshit\". I don't think it's big enough to be grounds for divorce, but I don't want our kid to suffer because her dad sucks at life sometimes and can't put on his big boy underwear to be a fucking dad.\nTL;DR:"}

Our relationship is great but not perfect and I care a lot about her.

She's a type of girl I could see myself with, but I've just seen her as a friends of course. Learning this has really twisted my mind. Suddenly I've been having second thoughts about my current relationship and the fact that I don't see myself \"settling down\" with my first ever GF. I mean, I'm 19 after all. **Here is my question:** Is this a reason enough to break up? I feel like I'm wasting my GF's time if I'm planning to end it some time later, especially since she's planning on going the distance with me.

I constantly have to watch out for myself, or else I'll get stuck paying for everything when we go out. He always tries to trick me into paying for at least more than half of everything we split, and going out is always his idea. So he invites people out knowing he's broke and playing the sympathy card, or ignoring the fact that things cost money. I've learned to deal with him by making it clear how cost will be divided or when I'm in a mischievous mood, by proposing expensive places to go to that he can't refuse when him and I go out in a group.

I hate coming home from work and spending the entire night in bed talking about my feelings.\n\nDon't get me wrong, its not that I don't like being intimate with her, but 5-8 hours straight of not really doing anything just drives me insane, especially multiple days in a row. \n\nIts been talked about before, we even almost split up over it at one point. I've explained to her that I want her around, but if there isn't much to do (neither of us watch TV) then I thought it would be a good idea if she brings a book or something else to do so I can get stuff done as well.\nTL;DR:"}

We are not like best friends or anything but we don't give each other the silent treatment. Pretty standard \"we can be congenial but run in different circles\" stuff. Generally speaking I would say that she is more outgoing than I am.\n\nI have a few sex toys that I keep in my room (2 didoes, 1 vibrator) that I use for...their standard use. I am very hygenic and always wash them after use. For the last few weeks, however, there have been a few instances where I brought them out and found...foreign substances...on them. I also thought that there was a smell but it might also have been general dorm stink.\n\nShould I confront her about it? It's weird to me because if she did it it's gross and disrespectful of my stuff. If I'm insane and she didn't do it, though, it will be really awkward on several levels. Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

I really liked him but we never got together again.  \n\nMy best friend who had a long term boyfriend when we first got to know this guy has since broken up with her boyfriend and in November had a drunken fling with the guy.  The problem with the situation wasn't the guy she had gotten with but rather that she was the one person I had disclosed all my unrequited feelings about him to.\n\nThe following week we had a long talk and she admitted that she had been worried all weekend about my reaction and was really sorry that it had happened.  I asked her straight out if she liked him and if she did that she should go for it. I want her to be happy and if he makes her happy then I'm all for it. What I don't want is her casually hooking up with him as it makes me feel like a piece of shit.\n\nLately I've started to suspect that they've hooked up again and everyone knows about it but me which makes me feel physically sick.  I don't like him in that way anymore but I don't like the thought of everyone laughing at me behind my back and keeping it from me.\n\nYesterday I got confirmation that they hooked up again a couple of weeks back but no one knows that I know. I don't want to be mad at my friend but I can't even look at her without feeling angry and upset! I feel so betrayed.  I want her to just tell me it happened so that we can discuss it and move on.  Should I bring it up or just try to forget about it? I don't want her to think it is because I like this guy, rather that I am hurt that she would do something twice that she knows 100% would hurt me.\nTL;DR:"}

One of the roommates is Muslim, and recently, she started showing opposition to my spending the night due to her religious beliefs. Eventually, this developed into her not wanting me over at all. She feels this way even though I rarely leave my girlfriend's room when I'm over. The Muslim roommate rarely ever saw me when I was permitted to visit, but apparently that was enough to bother her.\n\nI had no issues with this girl before this semester of college.

I have to drive an hour to come see her on the weekends, and when I do, I have to beg my friends for a place to sleep. I obviously do not want to meddle in my girlfriend's affairs, but this is incredibly frustrating for both of us.

{"prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I Got Yet Another Girl's Real Phone Number, But She Doesn't Call/Text Me Back.  Has this happened to anyone else?\nPOST: It's not a terribly complicated story.  Spent a couple of hours talking to a girl when we had to split ways because of class.  I ask her for her number so I can call her and we can hang out after class is over.  I get it.  An hour and a half later class ends and I call her (I prefer talking to people over texting, but I digress).  The phone rings seven-dd times, and I hang up.  So I wait about half an hour, then text her, reasoning that maybe she'd rather talk via text.  I ask if she would like to hang out.  About 30 minutes later, she calls me and sends me a message saying that she had her phone off... and nothing else.  After texting her back, I have received nothing and it's been several days.  I also tried calling, but got the dreaded \"the phone rings one and a half times then goes to voice message.\"\n\nAnd just so you know that I didn't send a creepy message, here's what I wrote her in my text back:\n\n\"Hi (girl's name), this is (my name).  I was wondering if u would like to hang out tomorrow.  Maybe like we did today and meet at noon?\"\n\nI'm certain that AskReddit has had something like this before, and I apologize. However, this has not been the first time this has happened to me; in fact, this has happened over and over and over.  The details are always slightly different, but I'll get a girl's number, and either text them or leave a voice message, and I will never get a response.  Oddly enough, of the half dozen times that this has happened, I have never actually spoke with them on the phone.  Either a voice message telling me that, indeed, the number is real or a text saying \"Yes, this is my phone number.  No, I would not like to go out with you/hang out.\"\n\nI don't know how many experts on this subject there are or if anyone has had the same experience, but I just find it so... disheartening that the same thing is just happening over and over.\nTL;DR:"}

He then reaches into his belly-button, pinches it, and starts peeling his entire skin off, all of it, in one go. I can vividly  see the tissues detach. As he peels it off, he proceeds to eat it. He chews and chews and chews, and he starts drooling. He does it very slowly. He even gags sometimes, but continues to chew and swallow his entire epidermis. After he's done with the whole thing, his muscle-y face just smiles at me. He turns around by pushing down against the bed and twisting his body, hops off, and closes the door behind him.\n\nI also imagine myself lying on this huge human grill, and four sharp, skeletal, demon hands pinching into the skin of my arms, eventually piercing them, all the way to my bones, and ripping them out.

About a year ago I went through a rough separation with another girl and have been depressed up until the two weeks ago. This new girl makes me so happy that I can't even describe the feeling. We aren't dating or anything because she doesn't want anything till college.

That doesn't stress me but it makes me kind of bummed out, then I start thinking about how she drinks/smokes/parties but I've never done any of it. That stuff doesn't bother me that it's something illegal but it bothers me because I worry for her safety. Then I start thinking about her past boyfriends or just guy friends in general and how far they've gone together, she says the relationships never really worked out for longer than a few months but I still stress about it not because all I want from her is sex but if it ever comes to that point I know I'd want it to be special for both of us.

It took over 40 days for the two of us to get together for our first date (she's got a lot of things going on). During that time we texted pretty often, but it largely consisted of \"How are you?\" or \"Have a good night!\" - A lot of pleasantries without much of anything talked about. The first date was enjoyable, but it took some effort to get through.\n\nI had a suspicion that we didn't have a whole lot in common prior to the date, but I decided to see how it'd go. The date pretty much solidified that thought in my mind. Afterward I was left a bit troubled. I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue since we still really don't know each other very well after only having met once. Maybe something would click later on. After thinking about it for a couple days, I think I do want to end it. She's a nice girl and I consider myself a nice guy, but I'm not getting much out of just being \"nice\" to each other.\n\nMost recommendations from people seem to be that breakups should happen in person. How about in my situation? In almost two months, we've only been able to meet one time. Since we don't have much in common, I feel like we still haven't moved past that awkward stage in our interactions that you have when meeting new people. It might be weeks before we can meet in person to \"have a talk\". Should I just end things through texts?\n\nShe seems somewhat attached to me as well, so she's probably going to be pretty upset no matter how it happens. I'm not sure if that'd affect the approach to take, but it might be something to consider.\nTL;DR:"}

Long story short, after dating me all semester he went back to his home country over Christmas break and got back together with his ex-girlfriend of 4 years, and decided not to tell me. He tried to hide it, and when I found out, he told me we could still be \"friends and hang out ;) \" and I essentially told him to go fuck himself.\n\nBut I can't get him out of my mind. We had the most incredible sexual chemistry...he was the BEST sex of my life by FAR. I've never had someone who made me feel so amazing physically and turned on sexually. \n\nInitially after it ended, I avoided places and parties I knew he'd be at, but I go to a very small school and I HATED that he was influencing what I did and where I went. I can't ignore the fact that we run in the same circles...I know that I will run into him at least 6-7 times a week if I go about my usual routine. \n\nHe's a total scumbag and I know it. My brain knows he's no good, but my body wants to rip off his clothes and do everything we used to. When I think about him, I see that he's a loser. But when he's standing in front of me, all judgement goes out the window and I want to throw my panties across the room.\n\nHow do you interact with someone who you have intense sexual history with? It's so hard to act like absolutely nothing ever happened, and to pretend that the person standing 5 feet away from you was never sleeping in your bed. \n\nI can't stop thinking about him and it kills me, because he doesn't deserve another minute of my time.\nHow do I reconcile my mind and my desires?
