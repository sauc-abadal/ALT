We're all pretty experienced drinkers and we know our limits very well. \n\nHowever, when we started getting drinks at the bar from 2 different older frat guys (we are minors), it took them quite a while. No big deal, we thought, as this bar was packed with people. \n\nWe drank a small amount of our drinks, I had 2 beers, the girls had at most 1.5 mixed drinks (due to them being taken up by bouncers as they walked by). Again, we've been drinking regularly for years. We know our shit. \n\nBut last night, after not having drank for about 20 minutes, we all noticed difficulty breathing and blurred vision (okay, it's hot and smokey and crowded in this dark dive bar) so we called a DD and got a ride home. \n\nDuring the ride back, we all started feeling very nauseous and dizzy. Couldn't really focus on what our driver was saying or anything really. Walking back to our room was difficult, as we needed support from leaning on things to make it back. Once in the room we almost immediately lie down. \n\nThis is when it hits us that we are fucked. As far as we remember, we were dizzy and drunk for about 2 hours before falling asleep. The whole time. I'm a big guy, and that's not normal for me. I could barely talk, think, or see. The girls also reported blurry vision, dizziness, nausea. \n\nThis morning, I still feel like shit. My urine smelled bad, and I still feel slightly disoriented.\n\nThe girls are fine, I am fine, but we're curious and this is important to our safety in the future. \n\nAll internet research has lead to results that tell us we WERE drugged. \n\nIf anyone has some insight, personal experiences, medical knowledge or good tips on prevention, please mention them below!\nTL;DR:"}

[15F] of a year and 1/2, and I hate myself for it?\nPOST: So December 3rd, I broke up with my long-distance girlfriend. We don't talk much anymore; when we did, our conversations were empty, lacking meaning about anything. Talking just for the sake of checking in with each other. \n\nShe'd disappear for days at a time without messaging me, even if she was online on facebook or something - she just couldn't be bothered to send me even a simple \"hey\". \n\nHowever, we *did* once have a spark, and we were a couple of crazy in love teenagers who thought we could take on the world. \n\nBut for almost a month, I was thinking about how I was sort of just doing whatever I could to spare her feelings so that she wouldn't try to kill herself or something. I had to walk on eggshells around her and I hated it. \n\nI hated being tied down; I could have something better. It was a one-sided relationship; I put so much effort into making it drag out for as long as possible just to be ignored for several days at a time, and when she did message me, it was always her coming to vent to me about whatever.\n\nNot to make her sound like a villain; she was very sweet and loving. However, I just didn't feel our connection anymore. \n\nSo I sent her a very heartfelt, carefully-worded message via Skype (since, you know, we're long distance). But she still hasn't replied. I don't even think she's seen it yet. And with every second that goes by that she does not reply or acknowledge my message, I grow more and more paranoid about what she'll think or say or do.\nTL;DR:"}

I was a terrible boyfriend going through a very rough semester/time in my life. Unfortunately we broke up just as things started getting better for me. I see her around school which is nice but extremely painful in the sense that I miss her more than anything.\n\nI was mean and didn't want to go out anywhere, I was tired and poor. One time I even shoved her when she called my mother a slut, it was not the correct thing to do and by no means did I ever mean to inflict pain on her, it was a shove the way one man might shove another. She viewed it as a early sign of domestic violence and was extremely upset by it. I was scared by my actions, I've never hit a woman ever nor do I ever plan to. I acted without thinking and feel that there is nothing I could ever do to make things right or okay again.\n\nI put her though a lot of shit and was definitely needy, now all I want to do is take care of her and feel her love. I just don't know what to feel anymore.\n\nI've always been a believer in second chances and I know I've given her one at the start of our relationship, but I'm trying my best to understand her decision. I just feel lost and lonely. This is a girl I wanted to marry one day and now I get anxious and feeling sick when I think about being with someone else or her being with anyone else.\n\nI'm not sure what to do to make things better, not necessarily for us, I feel that there really isn't an us anymore, but for myself.\nTL;DR:"}

I ended up recently losing a good deal of it (84 lbs), and went from obese to what I consider to be on the lower end of \"chubby\".\n\n Anyways, I have had a boyfriend that's been there with me through it all. Every weight I've ever been at he has told me i'm beautiful.He has told me that he is more attracted to the larger women in the past, but I cant help but doubt him. He is a TINY string bean, noodle of a guy, completely adorable, down right sexy. In my mind I still think to myself \"how can a guy like that ACTUALLY find me attractive???\". So even after 3 years and a major body change, I still am embarrassed to take my clothes off around him, and I still have it in the back of my mind that he just cant like my body how it is. I've talked to my friends about it and they think somethings wrong with him or someones lying. They have told me things like \"Do not believe him if he says he's more attracted to chubby girls than skinny ones, no normal guy would ever like you over someone skinny\" or \"your kidding right? He's probably just trying not to hurt your feelings\" and things like that.\n\nI try to believe him, but I've just never met anyone like him, so it's just so hard to be confident. Do any of you have any tips on how to make my relationship better and put my mind at ease, or if anyone's gone through something similar?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by calling 911 for a man who unexpectedly collapsed.\nPOST: Just a few hours ago I was at work getting ready to close the store. I work at a smoothie/fast food chain and am pretty new to the job. With the insane humidity this week the store has been pretty busy with people wanting their questionably expensive smoothies and a small rush of a dozen or so customers had arrived at the same time. An older gentleman had come in at the end of the line and gone straight for a table to sit down. My only coworker and I are sprinting around trying to get the orders finished while simultaneously close the store when a couple of customers interrupt and say, \"Excuse me, but do you mind calling 911?\". I was a little confused until I glance over and see the older gentleman unconscious on the floor. In a panic, I book it to the back to grab the phone while my coworker with first aid training runs over to the man on the floor. After I hang up the phone with an ambulance on the way, I return to the front of the store to find the man on his own phone talking to paramedics as well as he continues to lay on the floor. He suddenly gets up, sits down in his chair and begins to read the newspaper after telling me the ambulance will be about 20 minutes. Dazed, my coworker and I bring him water and continue serving the even longer formed line in the store. After about 10 minutes he tells my coworker he canceled the ambulance and he'll be fine on his own. Before we could respond he was leaving the store and getting into his car. I currently sit here 4 hours later confused and hoping he's still okay.\nTL;DR:"}

Kinda shitty thing to do but never mind, we were close friends for a year before we started dating so I already knew this stuff and it didn't bother me then.\n\nSo anyway we were lying in bed chatting earlier and the subject came up, where she told me that just before the occasion with that guy she also pulled his brother, who was also in a relationship. I was really shocked, didn't really know how to react at first and just said \"that's really bad\" in a kind of neutral tone.\n\nWe started arguing, her argument being that it's the boyfriend's responsibility + they were in unhappy relationships anyway, my point was that she should have been the better person and she didn't have to do it.\n\nMy problem wasn't so much that it happened I suppose.. but the fact that she didn't care, not once in our whole discussion did she really show any signs of caring or feeling bad about it and I suppose it hurt me. She's someone I'm in love with, respect and care about and wouldn't think she would do something like that. I mean once okay everyone makes mistakes but twice... hmph.\n\nI don't think I'm a preachy person, but I really didn't like the stuff she was saying about it, I felt like I had to say something, that really, it doesn't matter if you don't know the other person you're still potentially ruining relationships or emotionally scarring people.\n\nWas I right to say anything? Am I just being overly-sensitive and my fear is routed in the fact that she may cheat on me or something? I don't know.\n\nAm I just being young and naive in the way I'm thinking?\nTL;DR:"}

Everything is peachy and both of us have been in relationships before, so we sorta know how this relationship business works. \n\nThe only issue is that I often run out of things to say when alone with her. I feel really self-conscious about it. \n\nI brought it up today in a self-deprecating manner during another one of my dumbfounded episodes - I was just looking at her and thinking vague but happy thoughts and said \"you know I always run out of things to say on dates.\" She said that she does too. But I still feel bad about it. I don't want to be a bore. She assures me that I'm not. I still feel like a loser for not really having anything to talk about. \n\nI don't think it has to do with our compatibilities; we have overlapping interests, but I can never think of anything fresh to say. \n\nThis happens in other scenarios too. Sometimes when I'm just hanging out with my guy friends I just run out of things to talk about and I can never think fast enough on the spot to really come up with something fresh. \n\nBut in other cases I never run out of stuff to talk about. For example, I went on a date once with someone else, and I remember my mind was just jumping from topic to topic and I felt like I could never stop talking and I always had a fresh conversation topic whenever one got stale. When meeting new people sometimes I just \"click\" and we just go on and on talking about something. On the other hand with some people we don't really hold a conversation. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I try planning out our conversations beforehand. I planned to talk about something for the date today but the topic slipped my mind. \n\nCould it be that we ran out of things to talk about? I remember we had a lot of \"let's get to know each other better\" sessions and we'd talk for HOURS during those sessions (5+ hours). I'd hate to think that this is the case ...\nTL;DR:"}

I got really close with a girl and I started to get feelings for her (1st mistake). I told her how I felt and she said maybe we could take it slow and just see what happens. I was fine with that. We were friends and not dating so we also agreed that we could still talk to other people (another mistake). I talked to a few other people but never pursued anything like I wanted to with her.\nFinally the other night, we're texting as we usually do and she brings up how she has a guy problem. Some guy wants to take her out and hang out even though she said he gave off a vibe of having feelings but she doesn't want to date him. We said we could talk to other people but it finally got the best of me and I simply told her to do whatever but not tell me. I also reminded her that she wanted to take it slow with me but it seems she's more interested in other people.\n\nThat was something wrecking her brain too and after telling her how I didn't want to be strung along, she said she wanted to just stay friends so that she didn't do anything to mess with my head or string me along. I couldn't do it and I told her straight up that I couldn't be friends with her or at least needed time to separate myself from her for awhile.\n\nWe said our goodbyes to each other and it was probably one of the hardest things I've had to do. I can take rejection quite fine but when I have to essentially give up a friend it hurt so bad. I'm very good with emotion but even I started crying a little bit when I looked on my social media and saw everything she tagged me in or liked of mine. It's just a sucky feeling.\n\nSorry for the ramble but that's my first friend breakup and I can honestly say it was one of the worst goodbyes I've ever had in my life.\nTL;DR:"}

They live in a fitting town in Oklahoma. One visit, I asked to play with the neighbor kids down the street, and they told me I was not allowed to play with those types of children. \"Those types of children\", my brother later explained to me, were ones grandpa and grandma didn't like just because the color of their skin. He used the term \"racist\". I was six or seven and didn't understand what that word/concept meant so I continued asking them, and I was punished with a spanking/timeout etc. \nMy older brother also came over with braids in his hair one time (It was the nineties, perfectly normal and universal hairstyle remember?) and they told him if he didn't remove the \"ghetto\" braids he would not be allowed to stay in their household. \nWhen I returned to my mom, I told her I was mad because I wanted to play with our neighbors but wasn't allowed to etc. Needless to say, my mom was FURIOUS and refused to let me stay there worried they would teach me similar outrageous things. No contact has been made with those family members. To make things worse, my biological father stood up for them and therefor we also have no relationship now.

I said if I were in a different place emotionally, I would probably want more from him - but that I'm not so I don't. He said he understood and he said he felt the same. We kept talking about the situation, and he said \"it's best this way, you're not even my type\" with a laughing emoji. \n\nI asked him what he meant, and he said he'd explain next time we met.

I'm worried he thinks he's punching below his weight and can do way better than - and I just can't see myself enjoying sex with someone that arrogant.

He was affectionate, funny, sweet, etc. Everything I wanted in a guy. Things turned kind of sour, because the 'spark' disappeared mid-way through our relationship. We've both agreed that it probably happened because we spent so much of our relationship online, and as a result we act like an old married couple.\n\nBut, we were still doing fine up until about a month ago. We started to fight a lot. I would get upset because he'd never hug/kiss me, or show any signs of affection at all. I'd complain that I'm always giving him head but he hasn't reciprocated once. Lots of petty things. And he'd always end the argument by turning it on me. Saying that it's my fault, maybe if I was a better girlfriend he'd like me more, etc.\n\nWell anyway, we got in another huge fight a few hours ago. Before that, I asked him what he meant by 'wanting to spend time together', because his idea of spending time together is sitting opposite sides of the room, playing games, and ignoring each other. After having a back-and-forth argument that was going nowhere, he told me \"I don't like you. Why would I actually want to do something with you if I don't like you.\"\n\nI don't really know where to go with this.. I just want to know if there's anything I can do to repair the relationship.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Listening to music in the car makes me(18F) feel like I'm dying\nPOST: I'm not really sure how to explain it or what to call it but I've had this for as long as I could remember. Sometimes when there is music in the car, I react very badly to it emotionally and physically. This happens randomly and it happens with even songs I like. When a part of the song hits a certain tone or note, I start feeling mild discomfort or annoyance but then it will go from there and get worse. At it's very worst, the only way I can describe it is that the music makes me feel like I'm dying or it's killing me. It's excruciating and I flip out while trying to get away from the music. \n\nMost of the time this happens when I'm in the car with my family and I'll ask them to turn off the music completely. They take it as a sign of assholery and would often tell me to stop being so selfish, which I understand, but the pain is so unbearable I really can't help it.\n\nRecently I've started riding in the cars of friends more often and I'm afraid of what will happen if this is triggered in their car. It would be rude to tell them to turn off their music when I'm in their car. I avoid riding in other people's cars if I can because I'm afraid of a bad reaction to their music. \n\nThis has happened two times recently in my friends' cars. The first time I was in a classmate's car, but I was able to bear it because it was a short car ride so I did my best to block out the music. The second time was with my boyfriend today in his car and it was a long ride. Thankfully he turned off his music and wasn't offended, just confused. \n\nOther times this has happened were in elementary school when we carpooled for field trips. Back then I'd just start crying because of the pain.\n\nIs there any way I can ask people in the future to turn off their music without being rude? Does anyone else experience this? If so it would be helpful to get some advice on how to handle this. Right now I try plugging my ears, blocking out the sound, and meditating.\nTL;DR:"}

I might have let go of 'the one'.\nPOST: I told a lie in our first date about a personal detail of mine, not a one that will ruin my life, but one where you try to lie and impress in first dates. We met for 2 dates and then I had to move to a different city. We continue to meet once each month, for 2-3 days. Sometimes I went to her city and vice-versa. We were in touch everyday through text and face-time, from waking up till sleeping. We were both really into each other. During this time I didn't see another girl, and she said she didn't see other guys too. \n\nThis went on for 9 months. I was constantly aware of the lie I told in the first date. During this time neither of us talked about what nature of relationship we wanted. I was aware of the long distance nature of our relationship. One day she said she wanted to be serious and take our relationship to officially bf-gf. She was even talking about moving closer to me. I remembered about the lie I told her in our first date, and decided to end it. We stopped contacting each other the next day. I have been thinking about this and it's eating me up. I hurt her real bad and I think she deserves to know I lied to her. \n\nShould I talk with her about this? I am not expecting her to resume our relationship.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: Caused a car crash yesterday. I can't get over the guilt.\nPOST: I'm a 16 year old living in Minnesota. Yesterday, I was coming home from work. I got to an intersection, looked at the light, and I couldn't see what color it was. The glare from the sun was too bright and I had no idea what color it was. To my right only a grey van and a volkswagen were going through. I though they were running the red light, but I guess I was. The grey van got away, and I fendered the volkswagen. Lucky, no one was hurt. I got out and checked if they were ok (there was a 60 something woman and a young man in the car) and they were. I checked my damage on the front and it was very little, the front light fell out along with some bumper damage. probably a 500 dollar repair. My 2002 Yukon XL is a toughie. Their car was a little worse than mine. their driver side fender was wrecked. After that I did the normal emergency stuff and so.\n\nSo, I'm fucked over right now. My dad was furious at me at first, but when he saw the car's little damage, he calmed down. 1 thing down.\n\nI thought my friends would laugh at me for being such a dunce. I've kept quiet, and so has my family. 2 things down.\n\nNow... about that insurance policy. As a naive kid, they already charge me more because i'm a teenager. But now, my insurance will fuck me and my family over, because I have had *2* accidents. In July, I had an accident, but I didn't break any laws.\n\nI was backing up my van to the trailer and the gas pedal jammed. I flew back, hit my dad, and caused about 4k in damage, not including his med bills. (our insurance covered most of that). Since that wasn't breaking any laws and was also a complete malfunction, I don't think my insurance went up. My parents haven't told me. \n\nSo back to today. i'm worried because I've been in 2 accidents that my insurance rate will go up.\nTL;DR:"}

We're at it for about an hour and it gets to be pretty exhausting; the sun was blazing, and we were having to chase after the balls that were hit as well as the ones that were not hit and just flying past the batter.  We decide to head home after he bats one more set of balls. We had one baseball and one lacrosse ball because the lacrosse ball worked well as a baseball.  I pitch about three or four times and he strikes out of all of them and it may have just been me but he looks pretty down about it so I say: \"Come on, just hit the shit out of this last one and we'll go home\". \n\nNow, my brother is about 6'2\" so far and this kid ain't no slouch. He used to do sports and wrestling in high school and shit. So we get into our respective positions ( about 30 feet away from each other)  and I let the ball fly, right at his bat (I found out later that he put everything he had into that swing).

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, what petty thefts of minor value have caused a huge trouble/inconvenience for you?\nPOST: Mine is work related. A quick background, I work for a service contractor in the Oil & Gas industry. We mainly deal with offshore construction work worth millions every year and I coordinate the movement of equipments and personnel both onshore and offshore.\n\nOver the weekend the client required us to move some additional equipment and tools from our warehouse to the offshore platform and before loading out the items onto the supply boat I had the items moved to a loading bay and as the supply boat happened to be on maintenance that day (I was not aware of this as the supply boat is handled by our client), they had to leave our things overnight in the loading bay.\n\nThe next day when the items were sent out offshore and the recipient inspected the items sent against the consignment checklist, they found a number of things missing/stolen. Now being in this industry, any safety and security related incidents becomes a **huge** deal even if the incident is minor. \n\nRumors flew around saying the things that went missing were worth around $10,000-60,000 and of course this raised a red flag with my company's management and client. I've had to send a mass mail to relevant persons to calm the fire and now I'm stuck behind a desk making a detailed report of this incident where every *concerned* parties must be notified and reported to.\n\nAnyway just felt like ranting because the system is so silly to be making a huge deal out of nothing. Oh and the value of the missing items were only $900 (of which only 1 tool is worth $750 and 10 other things were around $10-$20).\nTL;DR:"}

I've been with my partner for 7 years, he's a genuinely lovely person but I'm really struggling to figure out if I'm actually in love with him or simply love being in a relationship (companionship, hugs etc). He's not got much going on at the moment, still 'trying' to finish a uni course he should have finished 4 years ago now (if you call not showing up to lectures or doing course work 'trying'). No job, no drive to do anything at all. Honestly most days he spends it by the computer browsing random stuff on the internet and drinking beer. He's also gained a lot of weight recently.\n\nThis has become increasingly difficult recently. I've finished a degree and postgraduate, got a great decently paying job straight out of uni and have just saved up enough to buy a house (which I'll be moving into shortly - we both live with our parents currently). We're in incrediblely different places and I'm finding it more and more difficult to relate to him. Part of me keeps hoping that he will finish off uni this time (5 weeks left), figure out what he wants to do and get some drive to do it. Yet all The evidence points a different way. He's always said he'd like to be a 'stay at home dad'- but I think it's more the 'stay at home' bit then anything else!!\nThis is my first relationship- hence the confused feelings. I don't really know how I'm supposed to feel. \n\nThere's no way I'll do anything about it for the next 5 weeks as I don't want to jeopardize the slim chance of him passing uni- but what do you guys think? How much longer should I wait it out? Is there a chance he could get it together? I'm also pretty worried about his mental health but can't get him to see anyone about it.\nAnd advice would be greatly appreciated thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

So I decided to stop by a cafeteria and grab something to eat on the way (I haven't eaten all day and it was already way past noon) and I ended up getting two mini pizzas to go in a paper bag. After buying the pizzas  I took the check (I picked this habit up from my mom to always pick up the check after buying something with a credit card to see if I'm getting ripped-off or not). So after confirming the price I went to throw away the check and as i was leaning over to do it, the pizzas slid out of the bag and onto the ground (upside down, obviously). I quickly picked them up, put em back in the bag, thought about if I could still eat them or not before deciding I obviously CAN'T and ended up furiously slamming them into the next trashbag I saw before going to the lecture hungry.\nTL;DR:"}

Most of my roommates are too afraid to confront her, saying we will find someone ASAP too fill her room and supplement rent. I on the other hand find want our landlord to challenge her.

I just feel if I bury the feelings I'll end up miserable with her by my side every day and yet so far away, or I'll end up with someone I don't want to be with just to not be alone and it will hurt us both more. I'm just an absolute mess over all this, and it sadly has effected our friendship already. Can I fix this? Should I be patient and just wait for her to see what's in front of her? (Note here.. I have been single for about 8-9 years due to my ex-fiance's need to screw anything with a pulse.)\nTL;DR:"}

Unsure on how to support her\nPOST: I am a university student in my first year and have recently started seeing a girl on campus. We get on really well and what started as a fling quickly became a friendship into exclusive relationship. We kept quiet about it to families as being in university we weren't sure what it was and kinda wanted to stay single.\n\nOver Christmas however she went home and through our contact her parents were suspicious who she was talking to. She told them about me and our relationship. We were basically together 24/7 for the last few weeks of term and have been seeing each other for near enough 3 months.\n\nHer mum especially isnt happy with the relationship. She doesn't want her getting in a relationship and to focus on her studies. She told me this a week before break ended and that we would talk about it when she was back. She got back this Saturday just gone and it was weird between us for the first time as i didn't know where i stood. She attempted a break up with me, i knew it wasnt what she wanted. We ended up rekindling and spending the night together. \n\nWe have seen each other each day since but not in the same way, she is going back home this weekend and suggested we be friends for the rest of the week until she discusses this with her mum. However today we had a falling out over it, going back to being her friend and not seeing her as much is horrible. She is also my best friend at university and we almost feel like we arnt allowed to see each other. We decided she is going to ring her mum today to discuss it.\n\nIm basically unsure on how i can support her and what the best thing for me to do is in this situation. I really care for this girl and just want her to be happy, currently its hurting both of us as we just want to be together but her mums grip on her is massive. She is really driven by what her mum thinks.\nTL;DR:"}

I lived for a few days in my mother's family secondary house which a part of had been leased to a friendly family. The father of this family, I'll call \"uncle\". They were extremely kind and accommodating.\n\nDuring the nights, the temperature was so hot that i had to sleep next to the veranda/balcony, just behind a sheet of anti-mosquito netted-door. Also Pokhara is a mosquito heaven. It was decided a pissbucket was needed as during the night, the mosquitoes WILL infiltrate as the access to the toilet required going opening this netting door briefly. Plus, it sometimes rained very hard and combined by my lethargicness due to high-temp flu, a piss-bucket was the best option as it was convenient.\n\nThe pissbucket served with distinction and during the morning i decided to throw away the liquid and wash it. As I threw away the liquid and moved the water around without putting my hand in, the kind uncle basically took the bucket from my hand and unwittingly decided to wash it better with his hand. I was too shocked and dazed about what to do, that the deed was done before I came to my senses. I glanced at my mother, about what I should do and she basically had the \"meh\" face.\n\nTo this day, I cringe and feel apologetic as he was a nice person and tried help where-ever possible.  I don't think he realized and I will keep it that way, but still. Sorry.\nTL;DR:"}

She is stuck at home almost 24/7 because we only have one car right now. She never has any real desire to go out with friends though because of our parental obligations and the distance between our friends and us. She never really even wants to go out to a movie with me because of the cost and the nearest theater is over 45 minutes away. Aside from that stuff we have a great relationship and love each other with all of our hearts, truly. \n\nRight now I am away on a business trip and I noticed one of her ex's posted on a post of hers on FB.

She told me she would not ask me to do that, so I dropped it. I am not one to hold my tongue though and tonight I let her know how her talking to him was disrespectful to me as he husband. She got upset and said we should be past the jealousy in our marriage. I told her I am not jealous, but a guy that went off on me and erased me from his life, and later on apologized to her was not someone I am okay with her speaking to. \n\nI told her I stopped talking to my best friends sister just because she told me she didn't like me talking to her.

We were hand selected by our district superintendents and placed in the technology department to work as summer help. We started Monday of this week.\nWhen technology comes into work, we have a separate back entrance in our main administrative building for easy access. Note that we can't see the front of the building when coming into work.\nThis morning I woke up early and got ready early so I could come in to work about 20 minutes early like a good intern. As I walk from my car to the back door, I notice that the hall lights are out, but I didn't mind because I thought custodial hadn't gotten around to turning them on. I scan my badge, the door opens, and I start on my way to the office. Right as I reach out to grab the door handle, I hear beeping. I turn around and it's the alarm system that I didn't know existed. It wanted a code (which I didn't have). So I run down the hallway to the front of the building where Reception is. It's completely dark. I look out the glass facade of the building and see every parking lot completely empty. By now he actual alarm has started ringing like I had robbed a bank and the police were on there way. I realized I was screwed so I just walked out the front door and waited for the police, or someone, to arrive. After a few minutes, several cop cars showed up and all of the officers got out to check the disturbance. I had to give them my badge and they questioned me. After a while, one of my coworkers showed up and disabled the alarm. As it turns out, a limited number of tech employees work on Fridays and we're the only ones in the building for the entire day. None of my bosses were here today which was good. But come next Monday, I think I'll have to meet with my boss and the technology superintendent to get this cleared up.\nTL;DR:"}

She'll text me and say she had a rough day because she was depressed all day, and then when I try to talk about it, she doesn't want to talk anymore.\n\nOther times she will want me to visit her after class, and then cancel at the last moment because she isn't feeling up to it anymore. \n\nI've told her she needs to seek help and that everything can be better if she lets someone help her with her depression.

My girlfriend and I have a little 'did you know' thing going around; we share lots of those little useless facts and trivia all the time.  So the song gets to \"And he likes to sing along/ And he likes to shoot his gun / But he knows not what it means / Knows not what it means when I say aahh\".  \n\nI ask my gf, \"Do you know what this song's about?\"\n\nShe responds, \"I forgot, what's the song about?\"\n\nI tell her, unknowing of what I'm doing, what the song's about:  People who sing along to music without knowing what the meaning behind the music is.  \n\nSuddenly she shuts down like she does when she's angry at me.  One word responses, snappy, ignores me, etc.  Calls me an asshole, is furious with me when I ask what I did wrong.  (I was very oblivious to what I just did)  This went on for a while.  Towards the end, I realized the tremendous dick move I just pulled without even realizing it.  Of course she didn't believe me when I explained myself.

She contacted my work, family and friends and was overall a real champ. \n\nObviously this put some serious strain on our relationship and for the past three weeks, as I've cleaned up my act, she's repeatedly and rightly told me how much I've hurt her and how her world was turned upside down, which makes perfect sense. I've re-upped my therapy and treatment and told her how much I want to make it work and how sorry I am. \n\nFlash forward to two nights ago when she told me that a mutual friend had expressed feelings for her. I was a bit miffed, but whatever. The next day she texted saying he had expressed his feelings twice. I started to get suspicious and asked if there was anything else I needed to know. She admitted to sleeping with him while she was drunk a few days before I relapsed.\n\nI obviously lost it and she thinks I'm being immature because the acts should essentially cancel each other out. Frankly, I think this is bullshit, especially because she has made me feel terrible about my actions (which were awful in their own right) for weeks. Followed by lying to me on the phone, etc. Any thoughts at all would be helpful as I'm really riding an emotional roller-coaster right now.\nTL;DR:"}

We were semi friends initially, and then one day we hooked up and had amazing sex, and have been doing so once every two weeks or so for almost 2 years. The sex is still really good, but it has become a bit stale. There is a bit more to it, but that's the gist of it. My question is, how do i end it?  I am sure the answer is just to be straight up and honest, an ultimately it's really the only way to get it right, but somehow \"it's become stale, you annoy me, i find some things you do disrespectful, and i am kind of over it\" sounds a bit *mean*, considering i am not really looking for a change from him, or a response*. As much as i feel/thinkthose things, i do want to be respectful.\n\n* Actually, the truth is, i woudln't mind a response, i just foresee already the way he will react, and it bothers me and doesn't change the fact i probably want to end it. I am aware that andex used to say it wasn't fair of me to \"guess in my head\" how he felt about something without giving him a chance to actually express his feelings or react... but i just find it hard not to be this way.\nTL;DR:"}

She was alone and she was looking for somebody to spend her holidays with. Everything was great and she told me many times she was really enjoying the trip and that by travelling with a local(me) she enjoyed more her holiday. We have 10 years of difference and nothing happened but she asked some \"weird\" questions during the holiday like \"Have you ever considered marrying a woman from my country?\", \"What kind of cars do you have?\", something like \"are you rich\" and we joked a lot with each other and she also said \"If you ever become rich don't forget about me\". Now she may look like a gold digger but I would say she isn't. What surprised me about her is that she has been very nice and talkative during the holidays and I could really feel she was enjoying the trip but now she almost never text me. Actually the first 4-5 days after the holiday she wrote me everyday but it seemed like she wasn't really interested in the conversation but she was kind as always. Now a month later if I want to hear from her I must write her otherwise I feel like she will not write me, but she is always super nice in her texts. About her personality she looks very strong from the outside but I am pretty sure she has some insecurities inside maybe because she is not married yet and she really want to have children. So what makes a woman behave like this? Could it be that she doesn't text me because of the age difference or because she may feel a little bit insecure about it like she is disturbing me?\nTL;DR:"}

I've known him since kindergarten and has been my best friend for about 4 years. We had started to date because we had such a strong friendship and to be honest, I fell for him pretty hard and suppose he felt the same way. The beginning of the relationship was great, might've just been teenagers stuck in the honeymoon phase but in any case, we were happy. Things start to got rocky after a while. Finishing high school, college apps, finals, graduation, moving into college, etc. took a toll on both of us. Long story short, throughout the relationship he broke up with me once, then twice, and this time makes the third. He claimed he was unhappy, didn't like my personality, and was tired of being with me and so on. I'm in love with him but am so hurt by him and don't know how to feel. I don't know if I want him to stay or if I should move on. \n\nEnter guy #2, we'll call him V. V has been a family friend since I was an infant. I fell for him when I was an early adolescent but never really pursued him as I thought he didn't feel the same way. I've always had a special spot for this guy in the back of my mind no matter what. He was always my go to when I broke up with someone else although we never got together ourselves. Except for tonight. He texts me asking to (indirectly) hook up. So of course we do and he professes that he's been into me for years now and was too intimidated to make a move. He's talking about even setting a relationship. \n\nSo reddit, the point I'm trying to get at here is what do I do? I'm still not over T but I cannot pass up my opportunity with V. I obviously can't have both and am having a hard time deciding myself. Help!\nTL;DR:"}

After that we can decided on how we're going to continue this relationship. \n\nI'm at a lost of what to do here. I've tried talking to her and asking for her to hang in there and talk to me more and we'll figure things out but it feels like she's getting more and more distant from me.

We're both 25 and have a lot in common. We hit it off over conversation then we went on a date that ended up lasting 5 hours of continuous talking. By the subway ride home I was so comfortable with him my head was on his shoulder and I was all but falling asleep. We had a pretty decent kiss goodnight when I went to catch my bus. We then texted incessantly for 3 days before getting together again last night for a musical. The entire show we were touching in some way...holding hands, his arm around me, w/e. We were also sneaking kisses whenever we could...It felt right but in the back of my mind I just kept thinking...This is only the second time I've met this guy! Again, the night ended with my falling asleep on him on the subway and me sharing a rather personal fact. We texted again all day today and have plans to spend the afternoon together tomorrow just watching movies at one of our places. We've already made plans for months into the future (nothing in stone or with dates of course, just - we should do THIS in the summer kinda stuff). I already know all about his family and he's met one of my friends. It feels right, and comfortable and I can really see myself falling for him, but I feel like a relationship that goes this quickly can't actually last can it?\nTL;DR:"}

It had been at least a hour in when it was time to design poster boards to wave around as signs. I got the brilliant idea to write, \"I am this high in debt, they're going to saw off my fingers.\" My plan was in the works, I began to hold up the sign. Of course, no one could read it due to my very small handwriting, so I showed it to people walking down the street. I also brought the sign in service stations, grocery stores, etc. Keep in mind while doing this I was screaming,\"**HELP ME I NEED TO GO TO KOKOMO THE GOVERNMENT SCREWED ME OVER WITH TAXES.**\" This resulted in me singlehandedly scaring off everything that walked near our yard sale. Of everything we had, we only made five dollars, which was spent on drinks.\nTL;DR:"}

Is it wrong to only be attracted to certain types of girls?\nPOST: The first few girls I dated and slept with were all of the skinny, athletic build with small breasts. It wasn't that I sought out this type of girl, but that our personalities aligned and we ended up getting together.\n\nMy most recent relationship was a girl who was a more natural figure with large breasts (D cup and had a reduction prior). I had never been with a girl with large breasts before, but I quickly found that my sexual attraction to them (and her) and to other girls with large breasts increased very much so. \n\nSince that relationship has ended, I ended up sleeping with a girl who was more of the athletic build with small breasts. I had issues with performance and maintaining an erection while sleeping with her. Now it's in my head, and that fling has come to an end.\n\nMy question is this: Is it shallow to now seek out girls with larger breasts whom I am more physically attracted to? (I want to be clear that personality is and always will be a huge factor of attraction for me). Are there ways to get over the performance anxiety that occurred when being with a girl with small breasts? My whole attitude towards dating was to find a girl with the right personality and let things happen from there, but we are wired to be attracted to certain things. I'm not sure what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

Became close friends, and I really feel as if I can confide in him with everything; my thoughts, my worries, my moments where I try and be \"philosophical\". At a party we both attended, we came together, got super smashed, talked to other people and then ended up making out with each other at the flat. At that point, we were intoxicated beyond belief and I didn't think much of it. However, keep in mind that neither of us are the type to drunkenly make out or hook up with anyone. Neither of us really talked about the make out session after the night, just kind of saw each other, chuckled, and he claims to have blacked out and not remember anything.\n\nFast forward to a month later, he asks if I want to come over to his room to drink. A liter of vodka later, and again, we're making out; this time significantly more intense than the last. Fast forward to the morning, and again, we both act as if nothing had occurred the previous night.\n\nTwo weeks later from the last occurrence, he asked if he could come to my room. To my surprise, he brought alcohol again, and I guess it isn't hard to imagine what happened after that. \n\nHow should I be interpreting his actions? I didn't think much of it until other people around me keep pestering me on about how given the situation and the type of people that we are, that it definitely meant something. His best friend drunkenly slurred out \"What? You don't want me to tell her that you like her?\" to which he responded \"Shut up, before I kick you in the balls.\" Is it something more just two friends who constantly makeout only under the influence of alcohol? I'm still not to sure where I stand with him, romantically, as many of my friends (used to) romantically like him and by \"girl code\", I never considered seeing him in that limelight.

I don't wanna make this seem like a run-of-the-mill relationship question, I've been pondering it for a few weeks. I appreciate any response from anyone in advance. \n\nI started dating my current girlfriend a little over a month ago. Things were going great at first, we got to spend a lot of time together, etc. (typical honeymoon stage stuff). And we really like each other's company. I also don't have a lot of free time and money right now. I work two jobs, I go to school, and I'm pretty much self-reliant as far my  housing, automotive, and nutritional needs go. \n\nOver the past week, she's been making it a point about how we don't spend much time together, and I've been explaining to her that I'm spending as much time with her as I possibly can right now, but she can't grasp onto the concept, probably because her ex-boyfriend was there for her 24/7, and I am sincerely trying my best to make this work out. \n\nMy girlfriend is emotionally fragile, so my question: Is it really worth having to put up with this relationship at this stage in my life, or should I be honest with her and take a little break from her for a while, and if so, how do I let her know without hurting her feelings?\nTL;DR:"}

She had never had a boyfriend before because of her condition and the fact that children in middle school (USA) were weirded out by her. Also, she wasn't attractive as hell, but she didn't look bad. I was from a different school, didn't really care, started dating her, and she came to trust me a lot, and I let her. One day at her house she invites her best friend from down the street to hang out with us. Naturally, we play truth or dare.

I mean, come on.\n\nI was trying to play it safe and not seem like I was attracted to her friend, so I kept picking my girlfriend to choose truth or dare. It quickly gets to the point where I dare my girlfriend to get naked. She bowed out, chose truth instead, game kept going. I start running out of things to ask/dare my girlfriend, so I start picking her friend to do truth or dare. I wanted to see her naked, at some point I dared her to do it, she quickly stripped butt ass naked in my girlfriend's room.

This included CalWorks, a cash benefit, as well as CalFresh, effectively food stamps. She also is receiving assistance for tuition and books at school.\n\nWhen she signed up for everything, she truthfully advised the social worker that we had 2 kids, and that she was making zero income. The benefits she is receiving were calculated based on those figures. \n\nNow that I am back home, she is terrified that she is going to get into trouble for taking unauthorized benefits. She told them as soon as I moved back in that I was there, but at the time, we were still working out what would happen with out relationship, and I moved back in purely to avoid having to pay rent at two locations. Nesting is the term, I believe. \n\nTo this day, our relationship is still strained, and we still fight.

As you can guess I have some questions about how to get started in life without completely fucking myself over for the next 15 years financially! I just turned 18 a month ago and am working at a shitty retail job I'm leaving to become a bus boy, I am currently living with my mom and I'm starting a new job this week to save money until I go off to college in January! I have about $5 to my name and I'm starting to get scared. My first question is what is the best way to get my college paid for with my mom making $20,000 a year, and my father being deceased. I have no family except for my mom and there is no way I can get an assistance from her for my college costs. I received about $3000 in form of the Pell Grant from Federal Aid but I need more than that. My father died of cancer when I was 12 and unfortunately he had no life insurance or any kind of money put away for me. I need help learning to budget my money for the next few months until I leave for college. I'm going to be a bus boy at a local restaurant and I am going to be working nights. I really don't know anything about anything at this point other than work and save. Even if I save up a good chunk of cash would I use that for spending money to keep me alive throughout my years at college or should I throw it right at the school to try and pay off more of the tuition. Any, and I mean ANY help/information is more than appreciated! \nExtra Info:\nI'm white (doesn't help when getting aid for college, at least that is my understanding)\nI dabble in photography but have no idea how to sell or advertise any of my work in my current situation.\nI drive a car that wouldn't qualify for Uber.\nI don't plan on doing anything illegal for money.

He tried to show me one of his favorite shows that he thought I would like. I did a not so nice thing and started teasing about the show, making commentary that pointed out its predictability. He got really offended; I didn't realize it at the time, but he said I was being rude. He said he felt like I didn't respect what he does, which I understand now.\n\nI let him know that I was profusely sorry, that sometimes I just like to tease and prove people wrong, but I take it too far without knowing (he said that was a pretty terrible trait to have lol). I also explained that I appreciated his passion, but I just don't like to take anything too seriously, and I'm really bad with dealing with it when people are sensitive about something, since I don't really feel that strongly about things like that. I told him I really hate hurting people's feelings, and he said I could use some more tact.\n\nLater on, I told him I felt weird about everything, though I said it's kinda my fault. He was nice and said it was kinda his fault too. He said we should still hang out, and that he felt bad for ruining my night, and we both apologized again (though I feel like there's a possibility he might have said this to get laid since we were in his bed).\n\nAt this point, I feel a little bit like a terrible person, and that we're too incompatible to continue.

I heard that the cops were there, so I headed off to the basement. Set my drink down, walked away, and stood in the back, nervous. The music stopped. I expected this. The lights turned out. I didn't expect this. \nSuddenly, I see a flashlight bobbing down the stairs. Now I'm thinking how college hasn't even started yet (I'm at band camp) and I'm going to be arrested. The lights turn on, and there's a cop in uniform, yelling that he needs to see everyone's ID's. People start yelling, \"Fuck the police!\" I shrink back, thinking that you don't say that to those people. \nThe crowd rushes forward, and I was certain they were going to kill him. But then, I hear \"CHUG CHUG CHUG.\" I stood on my tiptoes and watched the cop shotgun a beer. The fuck?\nTurns out it was a buddy of the host's who works as a security guard.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 8 months, she was only having sex to block out memory of a rape\nPOST: I had known that she had problems with an eating disorder in the past, so I wasn't surprised when about two months ago she was committed because of it. Beyond that, our relationship has been fantastic. Both our families love us together, we share interests and the sex was great! This is surprising, as she told me, because she had never enjoyed sex at all, with anybody else.\n\nUntil, of course, the ED started wearing out her sex drive (so we thought). That was okay, I was happy to work with it. It hurt seeing her go through all of it, but I did and do love her, and I just wanted her to get better. A couple weeks of treatment in, she drops a number of bombshells on me. The two most important:\n\n1. She has \"gone back\" to before; she hates being a woman, hates sex, hates the way it feels, and hates worrying about pregnancy.\n\n2. A week before we started seeing each other, she was raped. She refuses to tell me any details, except that she hid it from the world and herself, and that she has made up her mind in not reporting it, and\n\n3. The only reason she was interested in sex was because, on some, subconscious level, it was her way of \"getting back\" at her rapist.\n\nMy first reaction to hearing that she was raped was uncontrollable sobbing. The staff at the hospital were very friendly and led me to the waiting room so I could cry it out. Eventually, though, it set in how fucked up it is that all the wonderful sex that we had was caused by a rape.\n\nSelfishly, I feel, I worry about the long term effect of this. If she doesn't want to have sex, it won't be long before I feel undesirable, as I've always needed that in a relationship. If she couldn't become intimate because of trauma, I would understand, but in fact, the only only reason she ever was able to do so was because of the trauma. She's still in the hospital, and since she's told me she knows it may be hard for me, I've told her I reserve my judgement until she is recovered.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [23 M] Unsure where to go from here.\nPOST: So my romantic relationship with my ex ended around 14 months ago and we stayed friends ever since. We both still have feelings for each other to this day and it made our friendship a bit odd to say the least. She gave up on us because having a long distant relationship was putting too much strain on her emotionally for 2 years and we had 3 moments where she broke up with me for a day or so between that. We stayed friends because of our large history. I was there for her to talk to about an emotionally abusive relationship she had to go through and during our time as a couple I was there again when the same guy (her close friend now) still put her down sometimes. Early in our relationship I helped her deal with many personal problems which I don't feel comfortable disclosing.\n\nSomeone caught her eye while she was working some months ago and they have been friends since then. They are fwb and are really fond of each other so its only a matter of time until they become a couple. It really hasn't affected me until very recently. I have suddenly become very uncomfortable with it and I am not sure what I should do. I still want to be friends with her and be there for her.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My girlfriend is going through mental attacks at random intervals and she needs help in treating it as its permeating everything in her life... how do i help or what can she do?\nPOST: OK reddit so this is becoming a serious problem. Since we started dating my girlfriend of a little over 1 month has been going through these mental phases which we call \"attacks\" that cause her to go into a mental shell sort of. During an 'attack' she will detach herself from me and not want to be touched or touch anyone and she refuses to talk. She doesn't laugh, smile, and winds up secluding herself every time it happens. Usually an 'attack' will last for an hour or two but that's just the average sometimes shell get a weird one that will last for days like the one shes having now. These 'attacks' have no trigger like i said in the title they just randomly happen. After some long discussion we believe that the source of these 'attacks' are the mental scarring that her parents breakup caused. Basically her mom met a guy when she was little and has had an on/off again relationship with this man ever since then. My girlfriend feels that every time her mother left to return to her boyfriend it was like she was turning her back on my girlfriend and didn't care about her. She knew that her mother still loved her.  My theory is that an 'attack' is my girlfriends mother's personality  from the past reincarnating itself into my girlfriends personality now . Idk what to do but try and be supportive but when this happens oftentimes she doesn't even want to talk to me. So what should i do and what can she do to help beat this? Also should this be left to a professional who can help to better assess the situation ad treat her and what would her diagnosis be?\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend of 13 months had always been faithful to me and I know always will be; but there is something that is very deeply bothering me. Her to best friends (both guys) say and do things that are inappropriate to her in front of me and when I'm not there. They will try to hold her hand, put their arm around her, ask to kiss or make out with her, and tell her that they love her. I have repeatedly gotten on to both of them and have blown a gasket in there face but they still won't stop. \n\nThe thing that really gets me is that she does certain things back that I am not in full support of such as telling them she love them. I know she means it as a friend but I don't really like her saying it nor does it help the problem. I have been having dreams and nightmares over this and I can't stand it. Of the times I've confronted her she has met me with \"well fine Bajrx2 I'll just stop being friends with them\" and when I try to say that is not what i want or am saying she replies with \"no its fine I understand\" as if I am doing her some great injustice. She is in a magnet program in our school and doesn't have that many good friends but even with that fact they have no right to be doing what they're doing.\n\n She will also go on saying they pay more attention to her even though I have literally abandoned all of my friends for her and when she is around me I follow her around like a lost puppy. She greats them with more enthusiasm then she does me as if she isn't remotely happy to see me.\n\n Am I in the wrong? Am I being fair about this? Breaking up is not an option because I love her too much and she is so very important to me. She isn't a bitch she is a nice reasonable girl except for this situation. Should I put my foot down with her or tell the friends to back off?\nTL;DR:"}

I will be 28.  And it makes me depressed.  I'll have to make new friends, politically work my way up the professional ladder, find a wife, start a family, the works.  This scares the shit out of me.  I don't have a dad to talk to or a family member who can console me or give me advice in this situation.\n\nMy three-year plan was to move to the Pacific Northwest or Denver, find a management gig, toss that salad for two years, go teach English abroad for a year and apply for the Adidas Management Trainee program.

As there isn't a r/quitmeth, I am asking for help here. Any advice?\nPOST: As the title implies, I don't really know where to put this. If there is a better place, please tell me. He(24) has been smoking for 2 years but has been living across the country(US) for 2 years and not keeping in touch with his family. His parents found out last weekend and flew down for an intervention type thing. They couldn't afford to hire any help, so they are kind of winging it. They have been asking around, and an Al-Anon(People affected by users) group told them to back off. They cant afford to stay down there long so backing off would mean flying home soon. Is this the best route? A cop suggested that they inform the DA at a upcoming trial he has(not directly related to meth) so that the court system will get involved. All of this seems wrong to me. My experience with the drug is that they need to get him the eff out of there and into treatment. I have seen it do terrible things, but I am not an expert on recovery/rehab. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nYou may ask why I care or am involved. My gal was really close with his parents, and he broke off contact with ball of them around the same time, so they continued the relationship. They are like a 3rd set of parents(she already has 2).

I just finished up a bachelors degree in biology and want to start looking for lab tech/entry level jobs so I can get my foot in the door.  I live in an area at the moment where there aren't a whole lot of these jobs available.  I am also in a long distance relationship and just recently got engaged.  We are going to start the K-1 visa soon and I plan to move to Washington in about a year and get married.  My question is, should I even apply to jobs in my field if I only plan to be here for another year?  I really want the experience, but I am worried that employers won't hire me if they know I will only stay a year or it might be poor manners/etiquette/whatever to apply for a job like that if I don't intend to stay.  I've never had a lab tech type of job before so I don't know if it's in poor taste or not!  I plan to get any job regardless if it's in my field or not just so I can save up money, but I wanted some advice on this situation! Thank you!\n\nAlso, semi unrelated question if anyone wants to answer it, I am not really sure who to use as references on my resume if I go about applying for these jobs.  I never really did any extracurricular activities, but I did work in a chemistry lab for 1.5 years.  If I am asked for three references I could ask the professor whose lab I worked in, but then I am sort of at a loss for who else to ask.  When I did work in the lab I worked closely with a PhD student, could I use him as a reference as well even though they are both from the same place?  My only other work experience is from McDonald's that I worked at for 3.5 years throughout highschool and university and a filing job I had at a doctors office in highschool.  Would using my McDonalds manager as a reference be stupid?\nTL;DR:"}

She's intelligent, sophisticated and has a strong personality. She can be obnoxious at times, but mostly sparks me as a spunky and playfully sarcastic girl. \n\nWe've been getting to know each this month. She's fun to be around, thoughtful and I discovered she's very sexual too. We're definitely flirty with each other and there's some sexual tension there. \n\nWe hung out yesterday and I asked her about her sexual history, since she admitted to bring a very horny girl. She told me she's only been with one person, and that was a 40 year old man. She explained that she had a 5 month long sexual relationship with this guy, and that she lost her virginity to him and thought she was in love with him. To be honest, I was really disgusted when I heard that. She showed me his picture, and he's a good-looking guy I admit, but it strikes me as odd that this young, innocent looking and cute girl would have sex with such an old guy. It doesn't seem exactly normal. I told her that it was kind of a turn off, and she explained that they have amazing, electrifying chemistry and that she couldn't help but to feel attracted to him. Anyways, this really bothers me for some reason, especially because I was gonna ask her to be my girlfriend. \n\nMy question is, should I be concerned? Am I justified in being disgusted, uneasy and a little jealous? This doesn't sit well with me and I wonder if she's not as normal and level headed as she seems. Ultimately, I need advice on whether I'm overreacting or not. I want to pursue things with her and she's a catch, but this is just weird.\nTL;DR:"}

I turned 30 in January and I had recently before then gone through an exceptionally hard break up, one of those things that shakes your foundation and you wanna take a break and make a change.  In the throes of this I had decided to start doing stand up comedy, I absolutely fell in love with it.  In the last 5 months I've had 2 paying gigs and a slew of free ones and open mic appearances and impromptu party bits and what not.\n\nAll I hear from everyone I've met how incredibly hard it is to make it doing this, and I really don't mind... I want it, I'm hungry for it, once I started doing it I eschewed all other hobbies and things and went for it and it's going well.  I had a paying gig tonight and it was spectacular, I had over 30 people come to watch just me... I know that doesn't seem like much, Reddit, but it's a big deal to me.  I also got a lot of feedback from people telling me I was the best of the 5 people that were up tonight.  Needless to say I'm on a high from it, thus the posting.  I also have out of town shows coming up and even more things on the horizon.\n\nMy question is this:  Did anyone else waste a bunch of time in their 20's only to finally look down the barrel of getting older... of knowing you were supposed to grow up and figure out that what you had been doing is not what you wanted.  After that you find the thing you want to do and no matter how difficult it might be to make your way in it you still want to do it?\n\nThat was a really long question-not-a-question, I appreciate if you stuck with me through it.  I am not looking for advice, just seeing if anyone else did this!\nTL;DR:"}

The relationships works perfectly, we are into totally different things but enjoy each other. Once we looked at the future, we recognized that we have different ideologies, the way we want to live, the way we want to raise our children and which values we want to convey to them. We decided to forget about this and live in the present.\nFurthermore, it doesn't seem like love when I compare it to my last relationships, it's more like a really really good friendship, just with cuddling, kissing and sex. I miss her when I don't see her every two days and always enjoy her presence.\nLast week, I met a friend of a friend, who told me that she knows the perfect partner for me, a girl that's exactly into the same things like I am. I immediately was interested, and somehow regretted to have a girlfriend at this point. A friend now urged me to break up with my girlfriend, because it's a waste of time (at my age) to be with a girl, when you know it won't last forever.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Why so much hate for calorie counting (outside r/loseit)??\nPOST: So the reason this came up, is I visited my grandparents and the subject of dieting came up between my 24 year old male cousin and my grandmom. My grandmom has struggled with food and eating for as long as I've been alive. She has always tried all kinds of fad diets and exercise routines and has never been successful. She had surgery (gastric bypass I think) and is still very overweight. Her favorite diet is Atkins but it never works for her because she severely restricts herself for several weeks then binge eats trays of brownies and bags of candy. It's not a sustainable lifestyle change for her. \n\nSo anyway, she starts telling my cousin and his boyfriend all these foods that they can't eat (carrots, apples, onions, etc) and I merely suggest that there shouldn't be anything wrong with those foods as long as you are watching your calories and she (my grandmom) practically bit my head off. I tried telling my cousin about the whole TDEE thing and balancing proteins, carbs, and fats in a way that leaves you filling satisfied and energized but I wanted to give him something he could look at on his own later. \n\nI googled calorie counting hoping to find a reputable source describing what I've been doing successfully and I instead got pages and pages of anti calorie counting websites. It seems many of them assume that people who count calories won't think to eat enough fat and protein and will instead focus on mass marketed \"low calorie\" diet foods that taste bad or use all their calories on high calorie junk food and be hungry the rest of the day and ultimately fail.\nTL;DR:"}

He gave her black eyes the last time she went to Italy and the last time he was in the US. She recently broke up with him. Now, he won't stop calling her new job and booked a ticked to the US. He's told her that he won't stop calling her at work until she pays him back for the ticket he bought (after she told him it was over no less). They have been together for a year, but the abuse is escalating. I am worried about her safety, my sister's and mine if he comes back to the US.\n\nShe won't tell anyone at work what's going on, because she's afraid they'll fire her.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Should I extend my student loan repayment to help save for a house and/or contribute more to my IRA?\nPOST: Between my wife and I, we have fairly significant student loan debt (around $75k for me and $80k for her), which carry the standard 6.8% rate.  With the normal 10 year repayment plan, it comes out somewhere around $1800+ a month in payments.  \n\nWhile we can afford this (I make a bit over 100k with a 8% incentive bonus), it certainly makes saving money more difficult, specifically saving up to make a down payment on a home.  Right now we are renting a house, which in my mind is basically like throwing money down the toilet, not to mention missing out on the mortgage interest deduction.  Furthermore, we have just started a family (had our first child last October) and would like to buy a house sometime in the next couple of years for non-monetary reasons as well.\n\nIn addition to this, I am currently contributing nothing to my IRA, and thus not taking advantage of the 80% matching of contributions up to 8% of my income, nor the tax deduction for making those contributions.\n\nThus, my question is whether it makes sense to extend the length of our student loan repayment (to 20 or 25 years) in order to allow us to save up, buy a house, and make these matching contributions?  Doing so would significantly increase the amount of total interest we pay on the loans, and normally I am very adverse to having debt.  \n\nMy instinct is to knuckle down and pay the loans off ahead of time, but that likely means putting off buying a house or contributing to my retirement for several years.  However, I am starting to feel like my instincts are wrong here.  What do you think?\nTL;DR:"}

Which is better: [Hilton Nordica] or the [Icelandair Marina Hotel] I'm having a huge dilemma. The Marina would be a little more expensive with the deal I'm doing, and there are some pretty mixed reviews on Google and TripAdvisor.

How reliable and easy to use is the bus system?** I have heard of the Reykjavik Welcome Card, and that seems like a very good deal ($25 USD for 72 hours.) However, it is a little iffy how useful this would be. Would the buses be a reliable (and now free) option to get us to a lot of points of interest? If they are, it might affect the hotel question above.\n\n**4. What are some good restaurants?** Both of my two hotel choices provide breakfast, and most of our tours involve lunch, but what dinner places would you recommend? I'm looking for something that we could walk to or get to by bus, and I am very adventurous with my eating. A scenic place that offers Puffin and/or Whale is ideal. \n\n**4. What other experiences do you reccomend?** I want to get as much done as I can. I know that 4-5 days is a short time, but that's a hard limit. Please don't lecture me on that.

I repressed these memories for many years and it is not until recently I have started talking about it to a therapist and admitting it happened. This in turn has really effected my sex life.\n\nMy libido has gone down. Sometimes I am actually scared to have sex. It gives me anxiety to think about it. John is the most caring and loving person I know. In the bedroom and out. These feelings have nothing to do with him. I have had to stop him while he was inside me before but today I started hyperventilating and crying. he knows I was molested and that I'm working on it. I feel so bad because he says he feels unwanted. I don't blame him but how can I explain to him that its not him? How can I start to feel better about sex? Like I said. I love John to pieces and I really believe he is the man I want to be with forever. He tries to be very supportive but its hard.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My SO [25m] of 5 years maxes out his credit card for toys, but complains about taking me [24f] out\nPOST: We started out our relationship as a fling, but it grew into a much more real commitment. We were younger then and he told me that he never wanted get married and possibly never have kids, but I knew this relationship was one that I would want to hold on to. After talking to a few friends, I decided to wait and see if he'd change his mind, and he did. We've lived together for the past 3.5 - 4 years, gotten a joint bank account, moved to a new city together, purchased a vehicle and merged various other parts of our lives, so the next natural step in my mind is marriage. Over the past year or so, we've had several conversations about getting married and even gone to look at rings together.\n\nHe is conscious about the money he spends when it comes to going out to dinner and spending money on dates, etc., but not as conscious with buying toys. When I ask to go out to dinner (which is not more than once every 2 weeks, if that. oh! and a I cook every night of the week otherwise.), he moans and groans about how it's so expensive to eat out and he'd rather not. He eventually goes out with me, but it's so uncomfortable going to dinner with someone who you know doesn't want to be there, so it's not even worth it to ask very often. But what's really frustrating is seeing new toys arrive on our doorstep. I know he had to work to get the money to afford these toys and yet he says he doesn't have the money to go out or buying an engagement ring? I feel under appreciated and lower on his list of priorities when I see him working hard to get what he wants. This last point is my biggest problem with this whole thing. Toys in my opinion are things that aren't necessities. This doesn't include things that make his job or life easier, but instead luxury items. I've told him about this, but he doesn't see it as choosing these things over me. If he can't spend the time and effort on my not-so extravagant requests, why should I stay in this relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

When one of her relative died, I was the first person she contacted first but silly me I only said my deepest condolences and stuff without offering being there for her and it was through a message :'( although i did call the next day to be nice and yet again i forgot to offer to be there for her. It's been a little over 5 weeks since we've been really close and I've never made a move to ask her out, we did went out twice but it was with other people. \n\nShould I just stop trying to be with her? Because I feel like I should've asked her out earlier and now there's this guy (who's in a relationship at the moment, but he told me things weren't going well and he was gonna brake up soon) who always follows us around now and he's clearly trying to get her as-well(probably as a rebound) and in our group message they seem to have a great chemistry together.

The market is kinda hot now, but wages are still stagnant so I tend to lean a little bearish on this economy until that changes. \n\nHere's the #s \n\nHe makes around $85k/yr and has a company car. His fianc\u00e9 is HORRIBLE with her money and recently told him (after 6 years dating plus 2.5 years of on/off engagement) that she had been hiding $75K in private student loans. She's a nurse and makes around $60K, and has $60k federal loans and $75k private. She can contribute $1k per month to the house. \n\nThey currently pay $1,400/mo rent for a nice 2bdrm with a little lake for the dog to fuck around. The house will close in a month with a VA loan with just my buddy's name on it for veteran reasons. Smart, because as an aside I think his fianc\u00e9 is cheating on him. \n\nThe house will cost him $2,400/mo with taxes, on a THIRTY YEAR at 3.4%. My boss owns a wealth management firm and hates when I do this, but that's a total payout of $865,000. The house is like $285K, I don't feel like doing that math. \n\nWhen I asked why he feels so compelled to by a house, he said because equity. Quote: \"renting is NOT the way to go.\" However, he's also a known idiot. \n\nCan we just look at what he stands to lose by not investing that extra $1,000 per month for the next 1-3 decades? The difference between his assumed equity and just putting his money in the DJIA? He doesn't understand simple shit like liquidity, and that trying to get money from your house is the opposite of deciding to sell off some bonds or stocks.\nTL;DR:"}

When we got engaged, I moved to his country and we have been living in his house ever since. Moving in with him meant quitting my job and that was fine with me because I am ok with being a housewife or working minimally when we get married but I am a little concerned about a few things. My fiance never gives me cash for anything. He has me as an authorized user on his credit cards and I use them for any expenses I may have. He pays all the bills and if I need something taken care of he just tells me to give him the information and he pays it instead of giving me the money to do it myself. I am certainly not complaining because I am extremely lucky to have a man who loves me willing to do this. My only issue is thinking about rainy days or having a 'just in case' fund. He refuses to give me any actual cash and when I mentioned having a joint account, he kind of flipped out on me. He also has a PO Box and gets all his mail and financial statements sent there instead of to his condo that we live in. One day I was at home and I got the mail and there was a large envelope from \"Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management\" and when I gave it to him when he came home from work, he flipped out and told me not to touch his mail. 1.) Can anyone tell me if this is normal that he doesn't want to give me any actual money? 2.) Can someone tell me what kind of financial situation you have to be in to have a Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management Account?

So much so that I'd spend hours banging on myself with my hands, I'd always loved percussion and always had particular ideas for songs and album concepts. At the age of 13 I got my first set, I played on it, just banged on it for a year to find my musical soul. Starting last year my thoughts towards the drums and music started to cohere together and I had a basic understanding of what I wanted to achieve. Fast forward to early this year when I found the relatively small progressive rock. Slowly getting into, I decided to add some influences of progressive rock into my playing and music ideas. These past two weeks I had an epiphany, these bands specifically Porcupine Tree was the music I wanted to play. Ambient, psychedelic, I know it's not that big of deal all bands and artists have had these first moments. But I never thought I'd have it.... The feeling is just beyond unreal experience. To finally and completely know what you want in your life and at such a young age. Tonight it's raining heavily here in LA, I love the rain, I always feel inspired in it. And tonight I had the most important epiphany I've had so far, the musical idea that's been tantalizing me for almost 11 years has now finally come fully to my mind, I know what I want. After 11 years it's all come together and I'm so close, I can't believe this moment is happening to me.\nTL;DR:"}

Edited it a bit to clarify.\n\nMy girlfriend (whom I've been dating for just a short while now) has never really been open to having sex or even discussing anything physical/sexual. All she would tell me about it is that her last boyfriend betrayed her. Of course, I'd get more and more frustrated because I had no idea where the hell our relationship was going.\n\nAs this went on I started to get the impression that what happened with her last boyfriend might have done something worse than the usual stuff you' expect. This was pretty much a gut feeling based on how distant and almost scared she'd get if we ever got close to doing something physical.\n\nRecently, as we were talking, she sort of let slip that what happened was along the lines of rape. Of course, this confirmed my worst suspicions and I'm really at a loss for where to go from here. She's a really sweet girl and it makes me sick that someone would think of doing something like that to her. I made sure to tell her that she could trust me and that nothing that happened was her fault. However, understandably, she doesn't want to talk about it.\n\nWhat should I do? Pressing her for answers would clearly be the wrong thing to do, so I'm just giving her time. (This happened years ago, by the way. She tells me she's kind of over it, but something like that would not be easy to get over and I get the feeling she really isn't. She also didn't really give me any specifics at all about it so I have no idea how bad it was or how far he got or anything). I suppose bringing up sex and that kind of thing is also out of the question. We're having a lot of trouble communicating because of all of this, and she still totally shuts off when I try to talk to her about the future of our relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

This girl liked me a lot a year or two ago, and the feelings were mutual with me. I was very shy then so she was the one to finally admit her feelings to me, which me being a complete idiot told her I would rather be friends. I did this because I was scared, shy, and clueless as to what the next step would be. She then moved on (I think) and had a boyfriend for quite a while whilst I still liked her very much. That next year our communication went to minimal and only we would greet eachother and not much more. She still gave me hints that she liked me, I believe, like texting me first, hugging, enthusiastically greeting me. She then ended things with her boyfriend, and a few months later we started talking again. Just recently I asked if she wanted to go to the mall with me again, and she responded saying \"omg yes we should\" which to me is a big fat no . I still do like this girl after all this years. But with out past baggage, do you think it is too much to bear? I think about her all the time, I may even love her.

Any way i was wondering what kind i should get him and i figured this is the place to go please help.\nThe ideal breed will be a medium sized dog (like a lab) and not shed to much. It also should be very loyal, and friendly. Also if it could learn to play fetch that would be GREAT. Also my parents will e moving to the country in the next year or so and the dog will be able to get as much exercise as needed.\nThanks a lot reddit sorry if its a lot to read!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by collecting the post.\nPOST: Yesterday I collected the post from the post box and put it on the worktop. In the collection of post there was a letter addressed to me. I took that letter to my room and opened it! It was a Christmas card from a friend of mine and a \u00a310 note fell out! I pocketed the money happily and sent the person a thanks message. However they message me back saying they didn't send any money so I was bemused, but I kept the money anyhow.\nCome today and it all came down. My father asked if there was any money in the post box when I collected the post yesterday and I said no completely forgetting the \u00a310 I had found. Later on in the evening after denying I had found anything, during a chat bringing up the options I remembered I had found \u00a310 and it must have just been attached to the envelope not actually in it! I quickly decide to tell my parents that I had found some but didn't explain the story in depth and ended up just saying I lied to them as I didn't think they would believe me. Ends up there should have been \u00a315 which I don't understand and they no longer have any trust in me. I lied to them significantly early on in the year which came with consequences but I have been honest since then. They now have no trust in me and are doubting everything I've ever said or done. They're is nothing I can do to regain their trust right now and as its so close to Christmas I feel like I've ruined it all for everyone. To them I am now just a lying 16 year old of which everything I say is surrounded by lies.\nTL;DR:"}

Basically we'll express feelings for each other, just barely start to act on those feelings, then he'll bail and I'll actually never hear an explanation or a word for months or sometimes a year.  Case in point, the last time this happened I was on my way to his neck of the woods [which was about 12 hours away] with some friends on vacation.  We were supposed to meet him there so I called to see if he was still free and he let me know that he was getting married that weekend so he couldn't make it.  Uh.. wtf? Yeah.  So then we didn't speak for about a year, until now.  \n\nIn the process of a divorce, he's now telling me that he wants to be with me and wants to move back home etc.  The previously mentioned guy and I aren't exclusive, so I have fooled around with the douche guy, but no sex obviously.\n\nThe issue is that I KNOW the guy from school is better for me.  But at the same time I KNOW that no matter what I do or how many times I've tried, I can't let go of the guy I have all the history with.  We have unbelievable chemistry.  I don't want to hurt either one, and I wan't to make the right choice. But FUCK, I have no clue.\nTL;DR:"}

She still lives 2.5 hours a way, so we're still semi-long-distance, but it's not an outlandish idea for us to visit each other anymore. We talked daily while she was gone, sometimes writing for 3+ hours, but now that she's back she seems to have reverted back to her \"pre-Sweden\" self - doesn't have any interest in talking to me every day.\n\nNow, of course we don't need to talk every day, but the abrupt change in her attitude since she's gotten back is a little startling. Before she left, we spent a lot of time together while she was in town for college, so we never really needed to message each other much - usually just a text to figure out when we would see each other. I personally loved talking to her everyday while she was away. Most of the time it you could say it was the highlight of my day!\n\nWhen I asked her if she wouldn't mind putting aside maybe half an hour each day (possibly right before she goes to bed) to say hi and maybe chat a little bit, she accused me of being too needy. I personally don't think it's that unreasonable of a thing to ask, especially considering that she's living at home with no obligations like work or school right now.\n\nHonestly, I'm a little hurt that she doesn't seem to want to talk to me, even for just a little bit every day. I've dated her long enough to know that her and her family like to keep to themselves and this wasn't unusual behavior for her before she left for Sweden, but I loved the way we communicated while she was away and I would really hate to go back to the way things were. Am I being selfish and unreasonable?\nTL;DR:"}

I was told the HCN gas had polymerized/bonded to the plastic sample holders inside of the jars and it was slowly off-gassing/releasing trace amounts of HCN (?). Anyway, point is, I know what it smells like and I'm really, *really* sensitive to it. I can even smell it in car exhaust fumes sometimes. It freaks me out.\n\nNow, to my question!\n\nI bought a small jar of Archer Farms brand raw almonds at Target as a healthy snack. I'm not crazy about almonds, but wanted to get something that was unsalted and this is what they had. It doesn't say they are pasteurized on the package anywhere. Anyway, I cracked into them today and as I am eating them I am definitely smelling cyanide when I eat some of them (a note - your sense of taste is strongly linked to your sense of smell, and I can definitely tell that I am smelling it as I am biting down on them.) It's stronger with some than others. I don't feel ill or anything, but I have stopped eating them until I get my question answered.\nTL;DR:"}

I just got a hint that she took revenge of someone as in \"killed him\" . she always said taht she would never forgive 3 guys in her life, her uncle , the guy that gave her HIV knowing that , and a guy who hired her when she was a prostitute and abused her so badly .\nShe lives in another country, I still do love her ( not sure to what extent though after what she did to me) . and it looks like she is involved in killing someone ( she hired someone to do it).\nTL;DR:"}

I started feeling this feeling in my gut that none of this was right and they all pretty much fell apart. I guess by a manner of down right stupidity I started talking to her again. \n\nThere is a slew of backstory to our previous break up. She has always had confidence issues and it has always brought her down. She has really tough problems at home. She is home schooled and doesn't have a job or a car. Not only that but she is behind on her schooling as well. This finally got to everybody. I started becoming grumpy and everyone else around me could notice. We eventually broke it off after two years because of a very rough set of events that involved me being an awful person, tugging her around.\n\nNeedless to say... We happened to start talking again and we still have strong feelings for each other even after so long. I don't know how to break it to my parents that we are again. They honestly hate her I believe.

[xpost from self... oops :P]\nPOST: Copypasta from my other thread which was getting upvotes but no answers/discussions :[\n\nFirst, a little background on me, just because. I'm a Korean-American, born in Korea (South, if anybody feels inclined to ask) who moved to the U.S. of A at the age of seven. I'm a naturalized citizen, speak English much better than I speak Korean, but I'm fluent enough in Korean to not get the ol' wag-o'-the-finger from Korean-Koreans.\n\nI feel like I have a firm grasp of both Korean and American culture (the latter is a given, seeing as how I have lived the last 14+ years of my life here, especially during the all-important, formative years of my adolescence), and can fully understand and appreciate both the positive and negative points of both cultures.\nBut a trend I notice, especially among 2nd, 3rd, and later generation Koreans (pretty sure there shouldn't be any more than 4th generation Koreans, since the first Koreans came to America in the 50's) is this perpetual self-hate of Koreans and Korean culture. They're not exactly 'being racist' against Korean people, but they make broad-brush comments like \"All Koreans are xyz,\" where 8 or 9 times out of 10, 'xyz' is something negative. It applies to Korean parents, culture, food, music, literally anything and everything. It makes me really uncomfortable, especially because when I point out the flaws in their reasoning, these later-generation Korean-Americans just seem to cover their ears and start spewing near-propaganda-like hatred about Korean whatevers. Actually, scratch my earlier statement. They're pretty much being racist. Against themselves.\nSo I'm curious, multicultural Redditors: do you see this perpetuation of self-hate among later-generation people of the same culture?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm somewhat new to reddit and not very knowledgeable on how it works or if this is the best place for this post to be so bear with me please. :) \n\nI really love my best friend. She's helped me alot in the past year with personal issues and she's helped me get past past issues that i've had years prior. Before we got as close as we are now, I had some what of a \"forced\" crush on her. \n\nLet me explain, when I first met her. I liked her personality, she liked alot of things I liked and really wanted to be with her. After certain events, I told her about it and after said events, told her I don't feel that for her anymore... But now that we've gotten closer and I've allowed this friendship to grow beautifully, I find myself developing these feelings of wanting to be with her again. \n\nHowever, like anything I think about (doesn't help anxiety mixes into this), I feel like a relationship between us would never work as I would like it. I'm too proud to admit I'm wrong sometimes and she's too stubborn sometimes. Plus, I'm like a hopeless romantic and (from my knowledge) she isn't really romantic at all.  So, I'd feel like I'm trying to be too romantic and she would just be repulsed by it. (We have also been told by multiple friends of ours that we seem to fight like an old married couple sometimes which may or may not be a bad thing.)There is also the fact that she is abstinent and I'm not really sexually attracted to her (not that I don't find her attractive >.> she is plenty cute).   \n\nSo my question is, could there be a gray area between close friend and relationship that we could try if we ever reach that in the future? I was thinking something like a cuddle buddy thing but I'm not even sure.\nTL;DR:"}

She says that she loves two-step because of the feeling she gets when a man spins her around on the dance floor and controls her. She said its exciting to feel dominated/controlled and makes her \"curious to see what else he can do.\" After discussing how her attitude behind it upset me she said that the attitude and feeling she expressed was just from when she was with her ex, who she was not satisfied with. Since she was not receiving the emotional and physical needs from him, she sought it out on the dance floor. She insists that I meet these needs for her and it would be different now that those needs are met. She wants to go out without me so she can have time to spend with her roommate, which I am all for. But even after talking about it, the whole thing makes me uneasy.\nI know that she is in a different mindset now but it is all too easy to fall back into an old mindset when in a familiar place.\n\nBackground: My girlfriend and I have been dating about a month and it has been the most incredible relationship of my life, but the problem of distrust started at the beginning of our relationship. When it started she was dating her long distance boyfriend and we were both just looking for sex. Essentially I was the \"other guy\". Our feeling grew and broke up with her boyfriend and we got together. I was not the first guy she cheated with on him because she was never sexually satisfied with him in the first place.\nA few other notes:\n-she is a very flirtatious person naturally and has said she does it because she likes the attention.\n-she has acted inappropriately (feeding a mutual friend of ours) when drinking while I was there (she was very drunk)\nTL;DR:"}

I am 20 years of age, not very tall (slightly above 5\"10) and not very muscular. My classmates are 23 and above, and I keep being treated like a younger brother when we're not studying. This makes me feel like I'm not taken seriously, beyond the intellectual/technical level (been fooling around with graphic designing/sound engineering/producing for quite a while, got some grades in said things and think of myself as pretty decent). I helped my friends with graphic designs for quite some time, but recently gave up since it didn't give me any respect, but the role \"the technical youngster that of course will help me out\" instead.\n\nSince I have no real life-experience (went straight from upper secondary to university with only a summer holiday between) I don't seem intresting at all. People speak of the times they were Au Pairs in the US, went travelling across the world or had a long-term job. I sit there, thinking \"What the hell can I mention about me?\".\n\nThis also disables me quite a bit when it comes to girls. If I'm not DJing somewhere I go out for drinks with other people from school on the weekends. When I try to chat some girl up, I just get friend/niceguy/younger brother-zoned.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: One of my best friends [19/F] has a crush on me [21/M]\nPOST: Hi! I didn't really know where to post this but I am looking for some different insights and possibly pieces of advice from you guys. So basically, I've met this girl, let's call her *Emma*, on a night out over a year ago when she went to a bar with her best friend *Stephanie*, a gorgeous but very na\u00efve and immature girl. We got along really well and I instantly began to like both of them, so we exchanged numbers. Sure, Emma is really cool and we clicked very quickly but I only saw her as \"friend\", whilst Stephanie was more attractive. That's why Stephanie and I started to hook up casually for a couple of weeks, but we never thought about actual dating. Time went by and all three of us continued hanging out together. I discovered that Emma is a really nice person and a very good friend who listened to me every time I had something to get off my chest. Stephanie on the other hand, is a very attractive, young woman but she was subject to extreme mood swings, a real diva and full of insecurities. The sex was fun but her behaviour was a huge turn off for me and I started to feel annoyed by her. Therefore, I limited my contact to Stephanie after a while. However, Emma and I remained good friends and we would still see each other every now and then. Yesterday, I talked to a mutual friend of ours. She has told me that Emma has had feelings for me for a really long time. It started even before things ended between me and Stephanie. Possibly even before Stephanie and I started to hook up. We've slept on the same couch together, I have massaged her and I have told her very personal things. I basically see Emma as one of my closest friends now, there is no romantic interest in her. I like her very much and don't want to ruin our friendship. But knowing that she has had feelings for me for such a long time, makes it really difficult for me. My question is: Now, that I know that she has feelings for me, what should I do? Should I talk to her about it? Should I pretend that I don't know about it and ignore it completely? It makes our friendship so awkward now.\nTL;DR:"}

It took a while to become \"accepted\" by the few kids my age there. They were from only 2 or 3 families, and they have known each other for their whole lives. In the last year or so, one of the girls has caught my eye and I began talking to her a little more. She's a junior in high school, but the age gap between us is less than 2 years. \n\nThis April, I asked her to a formal dinner my ROTC battalion hosted. She attended with me, and seemed to enjoy it, even though it was a bit new and odd for both of us. I'm not sure if she realized it was my first date ever...\n\nNow, I don't know how to proceed.

He tells me that he doesn't want to fight with me because he loves me, and no matter how much we talk we won't change each other's minds. Therefore, we shouldn't even bother talking about it. I try to explain that it isn't a fight. For me it's truly interesting conversation and I love to hear what he thinks about things and why. \"Arguing\" isn't necessarily aggressive and belligerent. It's fun and enlightening. I want us to UNDERSTAND each other, not necessarily agree on these issues. While I do QUESTION his opinions,  ultimately my goal is to understand them, not change them. \n\nAlso, despite the fact that I have explained this to him, he still feels uncomfortable and reluctant to have these discussions with me, because he thinks other things are \"more important\". He wants to be carefree and pretend difficult issues don't exist I guess. He says I get depressed from thinking about things that \"don't matter\" and getting too hung up on them. It's probably true, but even so, these things are an important part of me and I need him to understand that part of me. Then when I say this, he says he DOES understand, but doesn't wish to discuss it further.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [16M] ex-girlfriend [18F] suddenly stopped talking to me even though we stayed as friends after we broke up. What does this mean? What should I do?\nPOST: So I became really really close with this girl I work with. We liked the same kind of music and it really started from there. We got really close, would tell each other all our problems, always support each other, etc. Eventually it got to the point where she told me she wasn't happy with the relationship she was in (which she was in for 3 years or something). I did my best to make her feel like everything was alright. I had no intention of dating her going into it, I was just trying to help a friend, but long story short, she initiated it, from there on we became a thing and started dating. I didn't expect this to happen, I had always kind of liked her, but just expected to remain friends. Anyway, I totally fell for her and absolutely completely loved her.\n\nWell some time later she told me that she didn't want to jump into another relationship right away after being in one for three years, and just wanted time for herself to be happy. Okay, I understood. I was pretty devastated, but that's what she wanted. As long as she was happy I guess. We still remained very close friends.\n\nWell about a week after telling me that she didn't want a committed relationship, I learn via Facebook's relationship status thing that she's with this new guy [18?M], a friend of hers. On that day, she just totally stopped talking to me. Doesn't text me anymore, doesn't talk to me at work (only if it's directly work-related). She totally cut me off.\n\nI'm pretty mad now. I'm mad because *I literally didn't do anything wrong* and now shes treating me like this. You'd figure it would be the other way around, that I would've cut her off. I'm pretty angry, though I haven't shown it. I'm heartbroken though and I miss my friend. I have recently started dating this other girl though [19F] and things are going well.\n\nSo Reddit, why do you think she did this? And what do you recommend I do?\nTL;DR:"}

A couple of weeks ago (after having asked more than once, and she would just say something along the lines of \"Stop overanalyzing, and let it go.\") she finally agreed to answer questions that I have about why she took a month to break up, even though she'd already made it sort of clear that she wanted to, about a month before. She then, again, said to just ******* stop, and that she has the right to make decisions without having to tell me everything.\n\nI agree with her, but I can never, ever stop wondering why she did some things. Please DON'T tell me to \"Just let it go/Move on,\" because I can't. I started Tweeting at the college she's attending, putting her name in it (that might not be a good thing to do, but I'm so desperate), in an attempt do have your agree to answer my questions.

I think I'm just one of those people who predators can pick out of a group. People have always been able to sense the vulnerability in me, I've grown to learn and almost accept this. It's part of who I am, really.\n\nAnyways, the past two years have been a really dark time for me. From the assaults to the hospitalization, the legal aspects, dealing with my family and school... it's been a mess.\n\nThe past couple months, I've really wanted a relationship. I have a bunch of friends, a bunch of male friends too. I actually live with 4 guys who are like my brothers. But I really want a real live boyfriend who supports me and has adventures with me and works out with me and smokes with me and can talk to me, and be a shoulder to cry on once in a while.\n\nLately it's been a bit harder, since I have to testify against one of my rapists. I have been dating this guy for about 3 months who makes me so so happy.. we are just so compatible. We do all different kinds of things together and make each other laugh constantly. But he is completely unwilling, or unable to support me with what I'm going through, and that kills me. It's not like he gets mad at me if I talk about it or anything like that, but he doesn't understand why I might've cried after sex that one time. He doesn't get that when I seem upset is when I need him to hug me the most. He doesn't want me to rely on him to make me feel better, which I totally understand. But I can't help but think emotional support is not too much to ask for..\n\nThis seems to happen all the time. I meet a guy who I try so hard to not fall for. They charm me until I fall for them and decide to trust them but once I tell them any of my secrets.. they fade away. \n\nI'm beginning to think that no guy will ever want me.. no guy would ever want someone so damaged and hurt.

We have been together for just under a year and things have been great. \n\nAbout a week ago the GF and I were discussing sex workers and the conversation got pretty heated. She asked me if I could ever be with an escort after a line of similar questioning and I said yes. I am open minded and honest with her as she is with me; there was something different in the intensity of he question, as if it mattered deeply to her. Anyways after I said yes, I asked her if she had ever considered it and she said that she had thought about it as you could potentially make a lot of money. I asked if she had ever done anything like that and she said no. She lingered in her response in a manner that I could tell was not entirely honest; I knew she was lying to me, but knowing this might be something difficult to talk about I let it go.\n\nLater that week I got confirmation from her friend that she had dabbled in sex work, to what extent I don't know and frankly I don't want to or need to. That is her business so long as I can know she was safe.

I also get the feeling he does love me but is hesitant on saying it because I haven't. \n\nWith the big 1 year coming up I also feel kind of commitment-phobic... like I'm young and should be exploring, not being in a \"comfortable\" relationship. I don't know if the grass is just greener on the other side. On the one hand, I am content with the relationship and I would miss him terribly if we broke up. On the other hand, there are some things about him that bother me (e.g. he procrastinates a lot, not very responsible/doesn't get very good grades). We've talked about it and he's trying to change but I think that's just how he is. I have still wanted to be with him despite these things but they do bother me and I don't know if I'm setting for something less than perfect. \n\nI know I'm still young and we're unlikely to get married or anything, but I don't know if I should be single for a while to work on myself. Any advice is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

After 13 years of increasingly bad fights, we are at the point where she no longer emotionally trusts me, due to constant fights over feelings and reactions to them. I came from an emotionally devoid family, and her the opposite extreme.\n\nIt seems to have swung in the opposite direction where I'm the emotionally committed, but she, for the sake of not fighting, would rather just not talk about things anymore.\n\nTherapy is a non-starter after several failed previous attempts where she felt like she was being targeted.\n\nFrom my perspective, she makes up her mind about how I feel about something without checking with me, and then reacts as if that's my feeling, regardless of what I tell her otherwise.\n\nCase in point, she had a hard time falling asleep last night, and stayed up in bed watching TV. I didn't really care, but she decided that I should be mad at her for that. Despite my best efforts to convey that I wasn't, I still got the cornered dog reaction.\n\nThere's a shit-ton more to our relationship issues, but this is the present one that sits on the forefront of my mind. I've asked if it's a waste of time to try to earn her trust back, and got a 'no', so that's a start, but it sure is emotionally draining and frustrating to not be believed or trusted.\n\nThoughts? I'll expound on the 'shit-ton' if desired.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/jobs\nTITLE: Relaunching Career\nPOST: Hi All,\n\nI am looking for advice regarding reentry into a career (Accounting). I previously worked for a firm for 4 years and became a CPA. \n\nThe problem with this firm was that it did not believe in staff training or career development and the job was dual discipline. Basically you learned the basics and that's about it. Which leaves me behind in my career (qualifications + years worked). I bailed last year when they (in a round about manor) asked me to sign a new contract for minimum wage.\n\nI tried another accounting firm for a while (temp) and explained the dual discipline issue and asked for a low salary compared to 4 years + CPA. Yet the boss, despite paying a low wage and being told about my second discipline, had high expectations. He was also a downright asshole, even though I still broke budgets.\n\nMy question is that since my attempt at breaking out of accounting is about to fall apart, how do I approach the subject with my next employer. I don't want to jump back down and apply for uni grad jobs again, but I don't want to have too higher expectations placed on me by an employer. \n\nI want to tell the interviewer to keep the expectations in check as i will keep my wage down. Basically I want to let them know they haven't hit the jackpot of someone highly qualified working for peanuts but at the same time without putting myself down to the point of them going \"oh shit, this guy is garbage\" and me ending up jobless.\n\nFor an idea, I was at that place for 4 years and have the CPA and am looking at jobs that want 1-3yrs no CPA.\nTL;DR:"}

How do you move past the bumps that are bound to happen along the way?\nPOST: Hey everyone.\n\nI think this is easiest to pose as a general question, rather than to give specifics for my situation (partly because I don't have specifics that I can think of). I've been with my SO for a little while now, and I am largely happy with her. As we all know, things aren't perfect all of the time, and problems do arise here and there. Some are really easy to move past, and have practically no effect at all. Others, however, take a little bit of a toll on everyone involved, even though they can be dealt with.\n\nMy question is about the latter--the bumps in the road that give everything a good shake and might slow you down for a bit.\n\nThese types of issues seem to arise more frequently when I'm already tired or worked up or upset about something, and adding them to pile certainly doesn't help things. These aren't problems where we're stepping on each other's toes or going against issues we've discussed, to be clear.\n\nIt's not that we think the other person doesn't deserve the effort, it's more like we're aware that future problems will arise, and that's not the most comforting thing to think about.

We get along super well, and we're constantly flirting. He's always touching me whenever he has the chance, keeping me warm when we smoke outside together, \"Good morning/good night beautiful\" texts, telling me he wishes I was in his bed late at night after work, even texted me after a smoke break telling me how bad he wanted to kiss me, blahhhhblah ok. So I started making it obvious I wanted to be in his bed as well, mainly by sending a few sly \"if you had a rough night at work you know my bed is always open :)\" texts, I won't drag on into specifics. But hes ALWAYS BUSY. And I know he does work like 16 hour days, and works early mornings, so that's cool. But he does get days off, and nights off sometimes, and we can just never work out a time to chill. I'm not sure if it's coincidence or..\n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is if he's serious, or if I'm just someone he enjoys flirting with. Or, is this revenge for denying him 2 years ago.

We watched some scary movies together, held hands, and have just been hanging out since then fairly regularly. We have a good banter around each other, and I've been doing my best to give compliments, hold doors open, and be friendly. There's some flirtation going on, but neither of us have addressed the issue of attraction directly.\n\nCut to today. She, I, and some of our friends went out to see a comedy show, having a great time and laughing. We come back to the dorm, just hanging out, talking and laughing while watching our hallmates be stupid. I turn for a second, and she abruptly walks down the hallway. Well, along comes one of our mutual friends, a girl I implicitly trust, who pulls me into a room and tells me this girl kinda wants a sign or so that I'm definitely interested, and that she's definitely interested in me.\n\nHere's the deal, though, Reddit. It's barely 3 weeks into the Semester, and I just met this girl 6 days ago. I really want to have a relationship with her, she's great, but I'm really nervous, and kinda want to take it slowly. It doesn't help that I've been single the past year, and haven't been in good relationships before.\n\nPoint being, tomorrow I'm going to try to talk to her alone, and lay out the facts, that I genuinely like her, but would like to take it somewhat slowly.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What was your most painful rejection?\nPOST: I'll start. A little over 2 years ago, I was with a girl that I was convinced I was going to marry. We both had our hangups prior to the relationship and had some obstacles to overcome when we began dating (namely, that we were 12+ hours apart by bus), but all in all it was everything I wanted at the time. People noticed on the outside as well. For example, her dad once asked her, \"it's different with this one, isn't it?\"\n\nSeveral days upon returning from a 2-month trip abroad, she called me and ended it. I was in complete shock. I gave her a few weeks and hatched up a plan to win her back. I ended up renting out the penthouse of a nice hotel in her city and convinced the concierge to lure her there so that I could surprise her. I had the usual: champagne, flowers, etc, as well as a whole weekend planned for after we got back together (I just assumed it would happen).\n\nI heard a knock on the door. This was it... I was going to win back the girl I was madly in love with. Everything had been going according to plan... until she saw my face. After the initial surprise, her demeanor could aptly be described as \"ice cold.\" There was nothing there. Absolutely nothing. I knew not to even try. We spoke briefly and she left. I had no desire to stay in her city given the circumstances and left the following morning. That was that. We still speak on occasion these days, but we're acquaintances at best. Took me a while to recover from that one.\nTL;DR:"}

We live together. \n\nI was recently offered a job opportunity on the other side of the world.  From the onset, I saw it as an opportunity to break it off and start over.  She saw it as an opportunity to get married so she could come with me.  The relocation date is pretty firm and its like a shadow that hangs over me now.  Its a deadline that she sees us needing to get married by and I see as needing to tell her by.  Waiting until that date would be the most selfish thing I've ever done.  I know what I have to do.  What I need from you is suggestions on the best way to handle this and support. I really need your support.\n\nI can't say that I've prolonged this 100% to keep from hurting her.  I'll say its 50/50.  The other half is that I don't have any friends and the fear of being lonely is absolutely terrifying.  I've never been able to keep friends.  I hate being alone.  I don't feel like I'm in love with her anymore, but she definitely is my best friend.  I know I need to tell her, but its going to feel like I'm losing an arm.\n\nI can't say that I'm even going to come back and read this.  Just typing all of this out affirms that I have to end this relationship, but I always tell myself that I'm going to wait for the right time (which never comes).  It is so hard for me to face.  \n\nOne last thing.  I have severe depression that I'm on medication for.  I'm not sure that that plays any role in what I have to do or how I do it.

She didn't feel as strongly as I do but long story short she said she isn't ready for a relationship anytime soon because of some personal issues she has, but if she was ready she would say yes to me in a heartbeat. We have talked alot about this and we both agree that for me to stop hurting we need to distance ourselves from each other for a couple of months or so.\n\nThis is insanely hard for me to do.

Her brother told me I need to watch my back, and her mom basically called me the devil. \n \nMy mistake is that I told my wife I had made up my mind that this was what I wanted.  I reasoned to myself that if she chose to her family over me, and chose to live in the town she grew up in for the rest of her life (something I'm not at all interested in), well then we had some irreconcilable differences and I should go on my own.  \n\nThat was about two weeks ago.  Things have fairly spiraled out of control since then.  She's taken serious offense to the idea that I'd even consider leaving her.  I don't see how different that is from her staying put while I moved on.  Now she questions if I've ever really loved her, since she's a dependent lover (her+me=100%), while I'm a more independent lover(me+her=100%+her). \n\nSo we're barely talking, after we got into it pretty deep last night.

I have stock currently worth ~$1000 that I never touch. Checking and savings (savings about $6k). A 403b opened last year thru my employer, with ~$1000, indicated all of this on my app. Credit score previously mentioned. Is this not a ridiculous amount to give to someone like me?

I'll start by saying that my worst fear EVER is having a girl leave me for my best friend.\n\nI met a girl last semester and we got real close. We aren't exclusive at all but we hang out often and really like being together!\n\nNow back to the story. My friend is everything I'm not. Tall, white, handsome and everything comes to him easy. And I'm happy for him, it's whatever because it doesn't affect me.\n\nThis semester he decided to take ONE class and come back to school. This ONE class out of hundreds of classes on campus is the same one my huge crush is going to.\n\nI used to think about how devastating this would be. And I dismissed it as a phobia, an irrational fear. But what are the odds?! Shes a pretty girl and hes a good looking guy and they're in a class now for 4 months, it's inevitable what's going to happen. We're all young and he can give her what she wants, a tall attractive guy. He hasn't had any contact with females and was just talking about how he wants to get pussy. What are the fucking odds, I am freaking out right now I feel that I'm in a living hell. I know that I'm not entitled to her and I don't own her, but I am literally living through my worst fear. I'm already convinced that there is a whole deal of pain coming my way. Sorry if this isn't in the right place.\nTL;DR:"}

[20F, 20M]\nPOST: We've been in a relationship for 4 months [20F, 20M]and we recently added each other on Facebook (just as friends, no relationship status). Neither of us is really into broadcasting our relationship, so we just kinda added each other out of \"eh\", not because we wanted to interact online.\n\nAnyway, my curiosity got the better of me and I perused his page one night and saw a ton of messages and pictures of him with his ex. They broke up over a year ago and haven't spoken in over a year because she cheated on him, and none of the posts are recent. It bothers me that he didn't take them down, but Facebook isn't important to him so I assume he just didn't bother. It's just the content that bugged me more anyway. For one, he posted tons of comments about how she's the most beautiful/sexiest/gorgeous girl he's ever seen. He's never said anything like that to me, so I kind of ribbed on him like \"I think you traded down!\", to which he replied \"It's okay\" and once he realized how bad that sounded he followed up with \"I don't compare you\".\n\nThere were also \"I love you\" postings very early into their relationship, where as I'm 4 months in and I occasionally hear \"You're cute, I like you\" from him. I know this is really petty but how can I get over my jealous streak?\nTL;DR:"}

She's very mature for her age, and has huge ambitions in life. She's sweet, beautiful, smart, and she's not the typical party girl who is shallow or uptight.\n\nI feel like she's trying to play the chase game. I HATE the chase game. I don't want to worry about the social stigma that is behind it all. If I'm into someone, I want them to know, and if they are into me, I want to know the feelings are reciprocated. \n\nWe've been on 2 dates now, both of them went amazing. Took her out for a very nice dinner and drinks for the first date, 2nd date was more casual and we went to a movie (it was a horror movie and she was clinging onto me for the whole thing). After the first date I decided to go about things a little slower to build a relationship, since this isn't a girl I just wanted to sleep with and have it be over. Kissed her on the 2nd date, and told her I hoped to see her again soon, to which she replied \"You will :)\". I KNOW she is into me, but then when it comes to texting she seems cold when I'm into it, and hot when I stop replying quickly (I don't overload her, I just text her maybe a few times a day, sometimes more depending on conversation, sometimes not at all). And when it comes to asking about going out, she is generally busy, and when I say, \"Alright, no worries\", then she starts offering days that work for her, after I've already tried to get that info out of her.\n\nNow, I want things to progress, but how do I tell her that I want to get past these games. Do I just ask her if she's interested in a relationship ASAP? Or would that just put her off making me seem desperate.\nTL;DR:"}

Is he right?\nPOST: I met my current boyfriend over a year ago and in general things have gone well. This is the first same-sex relationship I've been in and by extension the first time I've been asked to receive anal sex aside from giving. When it was brought up in the beginning of our relationship I wasn't really into it. Past experience with fingers wasn't enjoyable and could take me from being really into it to losing most of my drive. I like to think that I am a sexually versatile person, though, so I did some research and read a bunch of articles by notable sex gurus to try to figure out how I could enjoy having things in my bum. \n\nLong story short, it has been a year. I've tried toys, plenty of lube, fingers, different positions, etc. My partner has been patient in trying to help me enjoy it and not getting too upset that I would go flaccid after a few minutes of it. Last night we tried going from the toys to anal sex and I was flaccid the entire experience. It didn't necessarily hurt but it was so unenjoyable that I told my partner I am not sure if I will be able to learn. Despite that, he insists that with further practice with the toys and future tries that I will learn to enjoy it, but I am honestly doubtful that this will happen. Is it possible that I will never enjoy it? \n\nThis has put a strain on our relationship as he feels it is unfair that he is versatile and I am not. After last night I asked him this: \"if I never learn to enjoy anal, will that affect our relationship or leave you feeling sexually unfulfilled?\" He responded with uncertainty and reaffirmed me that we could keep trying and that we will eventually figure it out. This makes me feel somewhat insecure in our relationship if it means so much to him that he'd be willing to end everything over this.\n\nReddit, what do I do? Can I learn to enjoy anal or is this just a preference of mine that I have to be honest about?\nTL;DR:"}

I've known my best friend (we will call her Sara) for a little under 4 years now. \nWe met when I actually was dating her little sister (23/f), who later left me for her boss, and has since had a child with him, but we are still both civil to each other and talk, as I am very close to their family. \nThrough the passed two years, Sara and I have grown the closest then either of us have been to anyone, \nthere is not a secret we wouldn't share, or an opinion we wouldn't voice.\n\n      \nA couple weeks back, we went on a trip with a couple mutual friends to hit up some bars for the night, \nand have a good time. I guess that is when our mutual friends saw it, and started asking me what is going on \nbetween the two of us, and I gave the generic, nothing we are just friends, in which they had replied with \"Well\nyou two should be dating, you are perfect together\" and that is where we left it then.\n\n      \nAfter we had gotten back, I started to see that I was beginning to have feelings for her, because after all she is pretty perfect for me. When other mutual friends had asked her about what they observe, she would tell that that I am like a brother to her, and that she would get a little upset that everyone was asking her about it. I see what would make them think that we both have mutual feelings i.e visibly jealous when I speak to other woman, very protective, etc... \nbut how can I find out what her true feelings are, before I go making myself look like a fool?\nTL;DR:"}

In the span of 9 years I've been single for one month, and I'm 25. \n\nTo my question. I recently signed up to a 'Meet up Application' which matches you with other people in your area with similar interests for either sex or friendship. \n\nSo I've been talking to a girl right, and she gave me her phone number after we had a lengthy pleasant conversation. She was supposed to come over to my flat tonight for a movie, but I freaked out thinking she might want more than sex/friendship, and so I cancelled on her. \n\nThe thing is, she also hinted at going to dinner, or going on a walk around a local bay which is quiet beautiful and that's what got me thinking about her seeking a relationship, which I'm not at all interested in pursuing right now. \n\nHow do I ask her what she wants without sounding like a creep? To be honest I'm only really down for friendship right now and I've told her that but she seems persistent, and I don't want her to feel rejected! She's a really nice girl and I hate hurting others. \n\nDoes it sound like she's seeking more than friendship, or am I reading too much into it?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm hesitant because when he gets angry, he calls me names like w****, an ugly b & even c***. He says that he calls me names because I anger him & has made him feel inadequate as a man. This is because we've been through a lot & I have always called him out on the things that he has done but denies he has done it or that they happened. I supported him through a coke addiction, depression & thought he'd have my back too but it didn't exactly work out this way. We used to fight a lot because of insecurities. He would talk about other women & my body if I didn't give him what he wanted or paid attention to him. I never argued back with him at first but I got tired & fought back in the same way he did but fighting isn't me & I stopped. It only made matters worse so I tried the rational approach. It worked but the fights continued because at times he was irrational & refused to take responsibility for his mistakes & put all the past blame on me. Some of the things he has done are so disrespectful that it's really hard to trust him again & believe that he will have my back. I'm trying hard because I love him. Another thing he does is bring up the past a lot! when I decided to move on with him, I forgave him for his infidelity & the anger. But he has brought them into our future & uses my imaginary past behavior as a manipulation tactic that isn't working.\n\nWhy do I love him? Because he is a strong man & gets things done. He has qualities that I want in a partner but the anger & the retaliation have got to go. He wants to marry me but I'm reluctant unless we go to therapy so that he can learn how to communicate without attacking.\nTL;DR:"}

I thought it would be hot teaching her the robes and all that and it was!\nfor a while but there needs to be interest in learning.\n\nWe didn't have sex for almost the first 5 months which was fine, porn got me through the sexual part of it and she was more than enough to satisfy the emotional side of a relationship because she is an awesome person.\n\nWe had sex and it was excellent, she was a bit timid but I made sure she felt comfortable and it was good for two months. \n\n...in the beginning it was great, she is so hot and the connection we had is spiritual but after a while of the same position(guess which) it got a bit boring, I mean I was cumming but it wasn't getting anymore exciting and she had always said no when I tried to change into different positions. She likes eye contact and it is great but a guy needs some variety.\n\nI asked her when we were not in bed weather we could do some other stuff like doggy style, 69 and even that was too much for her and she feels it's too impersonal, we've had a few minor fights over it.\n\n...a nice body and a certain kind of sex can only keep the interest of a guy for so long. I need more but I don't feel like it's going to happen.

Then the next weekend when I woke, I thought get the fucking car fixed... as you would! Then he kept happening... So this Saturday I got up and watched him, stalkerish I know... Kinda fun and thrilling. Anyways so he turns the key for a while, sits and looks around, gets out of the car a few times then does it again. I noticed that he gives the poor car a much needed break when there is no one around... so this routine continued, but I also noticed that the car started once and he shut it off pretty quickly and then went back to torturing the poor machine. \n\nSo then just out of the blue he just drives off, started the car with not much difficulty and drove off.

Not limited to his view on women as object, the idea that forcing himself on said women was an acceptable idea, and self harm.\n\nThere came issues later into the friendship, including tiny aggressive events, such as crushing tissue boxes on her desk and throwing out trash with her initials (important because she deals with trash that, in the event of an oversight, may contain names and medical knowledge leading to HIPAA violations), and the theft of her personal keyboard.\n \nSeveral times she went to human resources to talk with them regarding these issues. No action was taken to rectify or even address the problems. A most I think they gave Jeff a number for mental health support and told my friend to continue to be his friend and support him.\n\nSkip ahead a bit in time, Jeff has quit, and my friend received an email from a throwaway email with a note basically telling her she needs to send racy photo's of herself or he would post pictures of her all across her job. The attachment on the email was pictures taken from video of her in the restroom of her workplace from several different days.\n\nHer work has taken minimal action in the matter.

Dating 6 years, living together 6 months.\nPOST: I thought about posting this to r/personalfinance, but I think you r/relationships people might be better at disecting this. \n\nMy SO and I have been together for 6 years, and moved in together this past year. We're talking about next steps, like buying a house, but therein lies the issue. I have money (like, 50K in investments) and he does not. We're trying to figure out how to combine our finances, and I'm wary of sharing my private nest egg.  \n\nA bit of background is required here. I have been working and saving my money literally since before I can remember. My parents tell stories of me growing green peppers in my backyard and selling them to my neighbours at the age of 4. Adorable, I know. I started investing before I was a teenager, saved for school, ate beans and rice and cabbage through university, lived in my parents' basement, paid off my debt, and worked multiple jobs at once. I have a bit of a nervous personality, so my money is my safety blanket, and a bit like my score in life. \n\nI love my man more than I like my money, but I don't really want to share. He says that if it was his money he would consider it ours (don't scoff, he studied philosophy and I believe him). So I'm feeling guilty that I don't want to just hand over those dollars that represent my working time. Those dollars are my payments for heat exhaustion, blisters, headaches, working weekends, etc.\n\nIf I were to change \"my\" savings into \"our\" savings, it would bring us years ahead of where we would be otherwise, as far as affording a house. But I also feel that if our relationship doesn't turn out well down the road, I would really appreciate past-me keeping her money for herself. \n\nSo the question is, how do you deal with unequal finances in a relationship? Does being in a serious long-term relationship mean sharing things exactly equal, or should it be a \"from each according to their ability\" type of thing?\nTL;DR:"}

I was completely blind sided, she had always told me that she was the one that she would never do anything with another man. we would skype for hours because I'm away at college and shes commuting to school. \n\nShe doesn't have many friends because she doesn't dorm and its her freshman year. So i was excited when i heard that she found someone, named Jim, to hang out with. We would always make fun of jim for being a little odd until one day she told me he said he liked her. I was taken aback but because she didn't have anyone else to talk to on campus i let her still see him, i was that comfortable in our relationship. \n\nFast forward to yesterday when she told me she got drunk at his house alone and that was a huge red flag. I told her to leave immediately and she did kicking and screaming about how i didnt trust her and how nothing happend. After pressing and pressing i finally got to the truth. He slept with her and now im shocked. She still tells me she loves me and all her frineds say shes really upset and that she still cares about me but i dont believe her. What do i do? I need help. Could i ever forgive her? was it a stupid drunk mistake? is infidelity ever a stupid drunk mistake? could we ever have what we once had it was so nice and idk if i could find it with anyone else.

I'll try to be as brief as possible.\n\nHe and I share(d) an apartment together. Neither of us can afford it on our own, so we both need to look for a new home. The problem is that I also lost my job and will be unemployed as of June 1st. Without a job my country doesn't allow me to apply for a room/an apartment.\n\nNow, I basically have two options:\n\n1) Move back in with my parents for the time being (who live 4 hours away from where I was/am living now). This would also mean I'd have to go look for a job there, but there are very few. I'd take any job, but I'm overqualified for most and the job openings in my field of work are scarce. It does also means there isn't any mad stress about finding a job as I won't have to be afraid of basically becoming homeless and if/when I find a job near my parents, rent for apartments is very cheap there (so I could finally start to save up money). But I have no guarantee I'll find a job there.\n\nOr 2) Look for a job where I'm living now. There aren't many available here either, but at least a shit load more than described in option 1. This would also mean looking for a home here, where rent is sky high. I think I could afford it on my own, barely, but there will be no room to save up or buy any furniture any time soon.\n\nTo top it off, I'm completely heartbroken and depressed which doesn't make rational thought out decisions like the one above any easier. It feels like everything I worked so hard for is completely gone in a matter of days. I could *really* use some advice. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Need a bit of advice.\nPOST: Hi /r/relationships,\n\nLet me start by saying we've never had the most prolific love life, but it's never been dead either. Unfortunately, we seem to be heading toward that end of the spectrum. In the beginning we had sex twice a week or so and we weren't even living together, these days we do it's closer twice a month. I have a very high sex drive, and am very consciously obliging to my girlfriend under the sheets. It's becoming frustrating for me lately because she says 'no' a lot more than 'yes' recently. The other day I tried to initiate when we had a bit of free time, and she agreed, then changed her mind, saying she didn't feel like it. I'm ok with that - that happens sometimes, right? But then she said she wanted to go ahead with sex anyway not to disappoint me, and apologized because \"girls don't need it as much as boys do\".\n\nWe didn't have sex and I didn't say anything about it then, but this school of thinking is a little archaic, no? I feel like I need to confront her about my needs sexually, but without sounding like a sex-addicted creep, and I'm not sure how to do that. There's not a lot going on in her life that would really explain the gradual dropoff. She has lost weight through exercise since January, but that's only served to improve her confidence. I'm her own personal cheerleader too, and am constantly reassuring her how great she looks, so it's not a body image thing either. Before anyone suggests it - there's no affair going on either. I won't go into detail, but you'll have to trust me on that.\n\nIf anyone's been in a similar scenario and righted the ship, or otherwise, I'd love to hear from you.

They are both strong headed feminists (I am also). But there is something I can't stand about her. She comes off absolutely fake towards me, when we hang out. She is also full of shit. I mean she comes off as a bonafide man hater, but yet she has been playing the field. She insults me because I'm a man and I have iguana brains. She acts like a fucking bro, which is cool, but can get obnoxious. My absolute favorite is that she makes assumptions about me. She recently started dating this guy, or whatever, she doesn't think I should meet him because I don't do well with other guys.  This was based during a night at the bar , in which, my SO and her were outside smoking and I was at the bar getting pissed at these asshats for insulting my SO and her. So drunkingly I got mouthy. I would never make my SO choose between me and her friend...ever...she can have us both, she deserves that.

But there is no way I can't share this story. So here it goes. Hopefully they don't find out.\n\nMe and a few friends throw a Christmas party this past Friday in our dorm. I go back to my room to end the night but my door is locked so naturally I assume my roommate is having sexy times with the girl he has a thing with. So I go to my friends room to hang out for a few hours and eventually come back and just open the door because I am fucking sleepy and rather sleep in my bed. As soon as I open the door my roommate and the girl jump up and say hey and bye and leave immediately. I found it kind of weird but then I just look at the futon and the cover is off and I'm like, that motherfucker jizzed all over the futon. So I'm like whatever and go to bed. I wake up the next morning and start cleaning our room and notice on the ground that there is an empty kleenex box. So once again I assumed he tried to clean the jizz off the futon after sexy times with his girl. But then I look to the trash can and there are tissues covered in blood. Now I am like WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED LAST NIGHT? DID HE RAPE HER?? Now I wait for him to wakeup and get back into the normal rhythm of things and then I say, hey man, you might want to clean the trash. Now he is like OH SHIITT I totally forgot that happened last night, I am so sorry you saw all that. I say hey man no problem, but what happened last night? He says, well, we were having sex but all of a sudden she says that it hurt too much and I look down and theres blood everywhere. She got her period while they were having sex.\nTL;DR:"}

I was expecting as such, but I really thought we could talk about it and get through it.\n\nEver since then she has been on a rampage.  She turned into the meanest person I have ever seen. She picked me apart like it was her damn job and that she had never loved me. I know she does still, somewhere deep down.\n\nShe didn't break up with me.  She said that every other person on this earth would, but she wasn't going to. She asked me what I would do in her position.  I said I didn't know, that when I had been cheated on before it wasn't even a question, I gave them another chance.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Do I [25F] have unrealistic expectations about him  [27M] making me happy?\nPOST: Boyfriend and I have been together for about a year; he actually moved halfway across the country to be with me a couple of months ago. When things are good, they're great, but for the last month we've been arguing pretty regularly, mostly about the smallest things - him drinking energy drinks, not including me in plans that affect me, etc. We even argued about our differing opinions on /milk/ the other day. He says I'm overly sensitive and that I get upset too easily. I can be a proud person, but I think he's got a point. I've never been this person in relationships before, but for some reason when I'm with him I get upset about these things. Personally, I think a series of negative events amount to slowly work me into a mild depression, and my venting then upsets him and BAM, we have an argument.\n\nWhen this happens, he tells me to just get over it. I don't feel like this is something I can do; changing my feelings like snapping my fingers isn't possible. What I would like to happen is for him to recognise when I am getting upset (before he is also upset) and do something to cheer me up, thus avoiding an argument. He feels like this is an unrealistic expectation, and actually called me in capable of handling my own problems today.\nTL;DR:"}

Not sure how to deal with what I saw.\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years. We've lived together for almost 3 of those with virtually no problems. However, when he let me use his tablet the other day (yes, let me. He literally handed it to me) I unlocked the screen to see a chat log open, which I immediately tried to close out of without looking at anything. I've done it before, no bid deal. But I'm kind of rubbish with hand-eye coordination, and it took me two tries to close the window, but not before I saw that he had been talking with his ex girlfriend. Normally I wouldn't care, since I still have friendships with a few of mine. But then I saw him talking about how she's still his favorite gf because she always made him cookies, and just general flirting back and forth. To be honest, I can't remember specific words because I felt pretty ashamed for seeing it in the first place, and I managed to close it out pretty quickly after seeing what I saw. I've been pretty concerned because he told me before we started dating that he had been really devastated when she broke up with him.\n\nMy concern is this: should I be worried? Should I just ignore it? Even though I didn't purposefully look through his messages, I still feel like I violated some sort of trust. And I can't help but be worried because he's cheated on other girlfriends in the past, so part of me is always going to wonder if it's something he's capable of doing again.\nTL;DR:"}

We started dating right as I left for college on the other side of the state, so it is a relatively long distance relationship. However, we are fortunate enough to see each other at least once every 2-3 weeks. \n\nWhen we started dating, I had just got out of a long and serious relationship. It ended badly but my SO is seriously my savior. I've never been happier in my life. But after all that happened in my past relationship, I'm just a little cautious with this one. I'd like to take things slow. \n\nMy SO really wants to meet my family however. I have met both his parents once. I come from a conservative Asian household and the whole dating and boyfriends thing isn't really a comfortable topic to talk about around the house. I have older two sisters though who have been through the whole thing but they have always dated Asian guys that my parents approve of.\n\nMy SO is white and I wouldn't say my parents are racists or anything, but I'm not sure how they would feel about that. If it were up to me, I'd wait a few more months but this means a lot to him. He is a great guy who is in school and about to train to be a firefighter. I know they will like him eventually. I guess I just don't want to deal with the unnecessary stress this MAY cause. \n\nI think he's coming by around Christmas and I plan to introduce them then.\nTL;DR:"}

We hung out a couple days ago after being broken up for 3 days and she was pretty cuddly and kept touching me plus was pretty flirty with me, she even changed in front of me but had her back turned. \n\nAt the end of the night she gave me like 4 super long hugs so i went in for a kiss but she said she didnt want to hurt me but wanted me to text her when i got home safe and actually texted me to make sure because i didnt. Then the next day i picked her up from work and dropped her off at the bus station to go to that funeral and she thanked me for being so understanding and patient and touched my arm and slowly pulled it away when she left. So does any of this mean anything or am i just looking too much into this and its just her proving to herself she can still get me?\nTL;DR:"}

I've posted on here before but had to remove my submissions due to her finding out my name, and I hadn't thought about making a throwaway account at the time (why the hell would I think she'd go on my computer and check my reddit page?). Anyway, I took the advice I was given by most of you, and I left her while I was on vacation with her after not being able to put up with her shit any longer. We had been dating for 13 months at the time, and for the last 6 months she has not been intimate at all. Called her out on talking with her ex again, found out she still had feelings for him, and I ended it. We both flew home two days later (I didn't care to change flights or anything, since I had already invested too much money in to this trip), and I cut off all communication. After about a week and a half she called me, and said she wanted to meet. Fast forward to her begging for me to take her back, and stupidly I did. \n\nHere we are, a month later, and I ended it again. Caught her lying to me about the stupidest things possible, and I asked her how she wanted me to trust her when she lies about just going to see a friend? I then asked if she even wanted this relationship. She hesitated to respond, so I got up and began packing her clothes and other belongings, and haven't talked to her since.\n\nI am furious over everything she did to me, because I literally did nothing wrong. I helped her out with school, made everything as happy as it could be for her. I took her places she had always wanted to go (Disney, Niagara Falls, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), and so on. I was 100% committed to her and the relationship, to the point that I had planned on proposing to her by year's end.\nTL;DR:"}

She told me she didn't really know what to say at the moment (I guess I did drop a bit of a bomb on her) and that she kinda felt like it was a dream. She, still a little shocked, asked me how I had developed these feelings and I explained how she makes my days better, makes me laugh and feel all warm and fuzzy inside :). She said that she had a big smile and was shaking a little and I said that I was too.\nI hadn't slept all night and she was heading to school so we kinda stopped talking for a few hours and when we started talking again she told me about her math test and we talked like usual and were laughing at all kinds of silly stuff.

We're still young and both still in university so aren't planning on marriage/kids soon but have talked about doing these things at some point. We were best friends previously and since dating, we've never had a big fight. All issues have been resolved by some discussion like \"I don't like it when you ___ because ____\" \"Ok sweetie, I'll be more mindful of that and try to stop in the future.\" At this point we don't have relationship problems.\n\n**The Potential Issue**\n\nA lot of the time I see couples breaking up over things and people will often comment \"they really should have discussed that beforehand\". Whether it's things like what religion to raise the kids in, what each party would do in case of an unwanted pregnancy, how comfortable each party is with the other using their phone, what is considered inappropriate by each party in terms of contact with ex-partners etc.\n\nNeither one of us are religious so we don't have incompatibility issues there, we each only have one ex and neither of us really talk to our respective ex partners so no jealousy issues there, neither of us have a problem with the other one using our phones/laptops etc but at the same time neither one of us snoops. \n\nBut I'm sure there will be issues I haven't thought of yet where we may encounter some problems. So if possible I want to talk about things where other couples have had downfalls due to competing values/ideas/desires where having certain conversations early on may have prevented such issues or brought to light any deal-breaking incompatibilities before there are additional considerations such as children.\n\n**The Question**\n\nWhat are the questions that would be beneficial for a couple to ask each other and before what point should they be asked?\nTL;DR:"}

I went to the vet the day before yesterday to get her treated for both, and luckily the URI was caught so early that the vet didn't want to give her any antibiotics or other prescriptions. Instead, he only gave me a probiotic vitamin powder to put in her food that should support her immune system. She was spayed right before I got her, which I know must have compromised it because she was so tiny.\n\nShe is sneezing and wheezing constantly, and her nose and eyes are running all the time (clear discharge that the vet examined). On the bright side, her appetite is totally normal for both wet and dry food, she's drinking, using the litter box, she runs around and plays and asks for attention. She has definitely slowed down in the past two days and sleeps almost all the time, but she does still have an occasional interest in playing. I'm sure it's good that she's getting extra rest.\n\nI have another appointment in two weeks to finish her boosters and get her re-checked, but in the meantime I'm terrified that she'll get worse, and that they won't be able to save her.

After several ignored messages, a phone call seemed a bit much to ask.\n\nI figure she isn't interested in dating me. That's alright. If she's not into it, I can understand, but I really want to discuss things with her. We'll definitely see each other again, and I'd rather it not be disastrously awkward.

Yeah, figure out that math. We were really young and in a long distance relationship but made it work. We both ended up doing some really stupid things near the end of our relationship. We didn't trust each other. He developed feelings for someone else. And then something terrible happened. I was raped and became pregnant. I cut him off and pretty much ignored him. I didn't tell him. I lied and said I was busy with school. Pretty much hid under a rock. I told him after I had miscarried as I couldn't keep lying. The reason I lied in the first place was that he started having an emotional affair with someone else. And he stopped trusting me. I thought he wouldn't believe me as our relationship was rocky, but since I waited so long to tell him, he didn't believe me anyway. That was really hurtful. I was a virgin prior to this happening. He was my first kiss, boyfriend, everything else. I only kept this from him because I was scared. I only told one person. A guy whose sister went through the same thing. And he was mad at me for it when I came clean. He thought I was dating this guy which wasn't true at all. Long story short, he completely cut off contact with me. Haven't heard from him in 1.5 years. I know he's in a relationship now as a mutual friend told me they're serious. I was in one. But randomly I'll have dreams about us and it just puts me back into this place. How can I cope with the breakup like he is? Never in a million years could I have cut off contact with him. I didn't mean to be malicious or hurtful. I was scared. I know he doesn't care about me one bit anymore. And for a long time I hated him for not letting me explain my motives. I've matured and changed for the better. Now I don't hate him. I'm just sad.

He has been at Hotel Dieu for the past month recovering from surgery and will be moved to a rehab facility later this month.\n\nDespite his injuries, he has been in relatively good spirits and appears to be taking the loss of his leg rather well (though the pain killers help, I'm sure). The other day, when our nephew suggested that he should dress up as a pirate for Halloween, complete with peg leg, my BIL burst out laughing and thought that was a tremendous idea.\n\nSo, here's my question: can anyone in the Windsor, Ontario area assist me in helping to raise my BIL spirits by helping to dress him up as a pirate for Halloween? One of the things we'd like him to have is one of the animatronic parrots that repeats back everything you say. Oh, and a peg leg, of course. \n\nWe live 9 hours away, but have family in Windsor that can assist with any logistics.\n\nSo, what do you think, Reddit? Can you help him out?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I'm a 22/M interested in a 27/F with children. Could yall tell if she is also interested in me?\nPOST: Hey Reddit, I am a 22 y/o male and have recently been talking to a 27 y/o female with children. To get this part out of the way, the father is no longer around and she is not currently in a relationship. The child is very mature for their age and I think it's unlikely it would become a burden should we start dating.\n\nNow here's the issue, I got out of a long-term relationship not that long ago with a girl who was YOUNGER than me so I am kind of new to the whole older girl thing. The girl I am interested in is very good looking and shares mostly the same qualities as I do. We met through a mutual friend a while back and only just this past couple weeks have started chatting back and forth. She volunteers at the military installation I work at so several days ago she told me it was going to be a boring night so I offered to come hang out where she volunteers. We hit it off pretty well and I continued to drop by for a bit while she volunteered as she wasn't busy. We got into playing pool and had a nice time talking shit to one another as I kicked her ass (lol). And today we went running together and talked about pretty much anything and everything that came to our minds. Now she is such a sweetheart and I can't tell if she is just being nice to me or is possibly interested and wants to date. She has mentioned we should keep doing things (fishing,hang out, etc) but the only thing holding that back is our schedules.\n\nSo Reddit, what is your take on this? Is she being nice or can I safely assume she is interested? Also, betafag\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Girlfriend [22F] of 8 months lied about her past with close friend, what should I do?\nPOST: My girlfriend has a very close male best friend. She always talks to him and sends him hearts and tells him she loves him. They also hang out alone together. They have known each other for around four years.\n\nAt first I was uncomfortable with this but I learned to give it a place, because she assured me that they have no sexual past together. I have since become friends with the guy too and we've been to a couple of parties together, once even without my girlfriend.\n\nHowever, three days ago, when I was checking my girlfriend's holiday pictures, I found pictures that clearly indicated that they were more than just friends at one point. I confronted my girlfriend with this and she admitted that they've been sexually active during a certain period. Later they concluded that it was better to be just friends and now she says that the sex she had with him doesn't mean anything to her anymore.\n\nAt first I wanted to break up if she kept seeing the guy, but after overthinking it a lot I managed to find a compromise with my girlfriend. The compromise is that she will not be alone with him anymore, she will not be physically close with him anymore and she will not send hearts and 'I love you's anymore. Moreover, I do not want to see him anymore since I don't want to be confronted with guys she used to fuck in the past.\n\nShe has assured me that this is the only thing she has ever lied about to me, because she was afraid of my reaction if she told me the truth.\n\nNow, my question is, have I made the right choice? Or should I instead break up after all? Or should I just let it go and trust her for being commited to me even though she hangs out with him? Your thoughts will be much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I am angry that she betrayed me by spending the night in his bed and coming upstairs and getting in next to me. I want her to see something of how much I hurt. So she has some apprehension of what she did.\n\nI know that's petty and I know that its pretty much pointless, but I cant stop thinking about sending a message to her and a message to her new boyfriend (the guy she cheated on me with, who knew we were together, who made an active effort to get in the way of our relationship) just letting them know that they fucked up.\n\nI'm hoping that posting this, and reading any responses might at least help displacing that anger and try to let this go.\nTL;DR:"}

Through a few discussions i found out that she highly considered the possibility of hooking up with any other girl but told me she wouldn't because she was with me and preferred me over another girl which was her best friend, fictitiously named Amber.\n\nFast forward to last night when five of us (including the three of us) had a bit of a party and had a few drinks. ('OoO underage drinking' yeah i get it, scold me another time). Very late into the night it came out that I was the only thing holding my girlfriend back from having a relationship with Amber, and Amber reciprocated the intentions of being together. I was shocked to be honest, it seemed like i was holding them back from something and it hurt to know.\n\nMy girlfriend then took me aside and told me that a while ago Amber and her had made-out at a past party while drunk, but my girlfriend, after a few minutes stopped and told Amber she wasn't comfortable doing so because she had a boyfriend (myself).\n\nIf i'm being completely honest i'm pretty hurt, this girl means the world to me but i cannot see us being together anymore knowing that she wants to be with me only slightly more than Amber.\n\nThrough writing this, i realize i might just be over thinking things, but i really need some non-biased opinions on what i should do. i can't really describe the situation without writing an entire novel , so i summarized the main points as best i could, (again i'm seventeen and stupid give me a break).

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/jobs\nTITLE: Almost to good to be true\nPOST: Gotta share this... I sent in my resume for what was described as a data entry administrator position for a global organization headquartered in my hometown.  I passed a phone screening and an in-person evaluation.  This morning, I had my first ever interview on Skype with their hiring manager based overseas.  \n\nSome background on me... I've been working what I consider a dead end job since I was 17.  I advanced from floor staff to management and I've been in that role since 2001.  I'm 33 now, still working for the company I started out with many years ago.  It's a publically traded organization.  Not that that's a bad thing.  It just means that the effort my colleagues and I put in often get lost in executive decisions tailored to the shareholders, and I just don't have the passion to advance any further with them.  Wages for my line of work, compared to similar positions elsewhere, are far below average and a recent survey showed 65% of those surveyed felt salary was not sufficient regardless of role.  Our company employs over 25,000.\n\nFast forward... the position I applied for is with a company that operates globally with offices in strategically located cities to allow operations around the clock.  It's entry level and pays a little less than I make now, but I'm actually ok with that.  Because I found out they have amazing benefits available on day 1, generous paid vacations and holidays, good opportunities to advance, and a philanthropic program that allows the trade of paid days off for volunteer work.  I know nothing of the business they do and I don't have a degree.  I've gone on my experience and faith in my ability.  But so far I've nailed the interviews and put myself out there as someone who's very interested in learning new things, developing professionally, contributing to the success of the organization, and taking pride in knowing that I can achieve anything.  \n\nMy interviewer today said the organization is a good fit for someone like me.  I guess sometimes, you don't find the best opportunities...the best opportunities find you.  And if I get offered the position, for once in my life I can say that I'm proud of what I do.  Until then, my fingers are crossed.\nTL;DR:"}

I had only met my great-aunt a handful of times. She passed away from a heroin overdose in the early 2000s, and was known to be a racist, and a bigot.\n\nNow that I'm 18, I want to change my name. I always have but haven't been able to, being a minor and all. My name has never felt like it was \"mine\". I actually have a post on /r/namenerds now, hoping those lovely folk can help me pick out a new name.\n\nThe problem is, I *know* my mom, my grandparents and basically, everyone on that side of the family will be hurt/upset that I've changed my name. My mom has told me countless times when I brought up changing my name that it was \"disrespectful\" to the dead relative, but why would I want to keep a name that reminds everyone in my family of a drug addict? \n\nSo that is the problem I've came to /r/relationships with today.

Communication issues when apart but otherwise everything is great.\nPOST: My gf and I have been together for most of our university lives and for the most part things have been great. In the beginning there were some issues in communication and showing affection, she's very shy and says she's bad at texting and I kept pushing her to text more. We've both made progress and things have been solid for the past 2 years. We have our fights occasionally but we have been pretty mature about it no shouting, name-calling etc.\n\nWe've talked about moving in together, marriage, kids etc. and I can definitely see a future with her. However when we are not physically together we can go days without texting and our conversations are pretty one sided with very short replies from her that make it hard to hold a conversation. This is the exact opposite from when we are together, sometimes she gets quiet but that's something I've accepted and enjoy sometimes. It's nice being able to be in the same room and do separate things etc.\n\nI guess the advice I'm asking for is how to distract myself from the lack of communication? She generally only texts me when we have plans to discuss or if we don't talk for days and I guess its her way of checking up on me or she feels obligated to send a text? I trust her completely and I know this lack of communication is just her personality. I know things will be great once we move in together but that isn't likely in the near future. I'm staying an extra year in school and she's looking at teaching english abroad (she says she will improve on the communication if she does go). My only doubts are when looking at other relationships and my past relationships, not talking for days sometimes is still foreign to me. I want to emphasize that I am accepting that she's not the kind to text all day or joke around/flirt via text, I'm just wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation and has some wisdom to pass on.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not introverted to the point where I avoid people, but I don't mind being alone. \n\nDuring college I worked 2 jobs and went to school full-time, so I didn't really have that much free time. Inevitably, I was slowly no longer invited out to do things and lost contact with people. I'm well aware that I had chosen the route of work/school over friends but it was something I had to do if I wanted to get myself through school.  The friends I did stay in contact with are all mostly married and starting families or they're friends that I see every so often. \n\nNow that I'm out of college, I'm having issues meeting new people. Most friday and saturday nights, I'm at home watching TV or in front of the computer. I live in the bar district of my town, so I hear people walking by laughing and partying...just makes me feel like shit. \n\nAdditionally, I feel this hurts me in potential relationships because a partner would realize that there has to be reason for my lack of friends. When I mention my lack of friends, it just makes me seem anti-social or even more introverted than I actually am. \n\nSo for people who meet friends after college, any advice how to do it? I live near bars, but I'm not a drinker. I've looked at events on meetup.com, but I'm looking for people my age. Any advice would be appreciated. I apologize if this isn't the correct section.\nTL;DR:"}

Over the past year I've developed feelings for her and just recently found out she felt the same way.  \n\nI got up the courage to tell her how I felt over the weekend, and it actually went pretty well.  She was a little disappointed that I had heard through a mutual friend that she liked me, but she said she was glad to know. She said she had tried not liking me, but the feelings continued to come back.  \n\nWe talked for quite a while and even shared a moonlit kiss. It was unbelievable.  However she expressed some apprehension to start anything because we live in different cities, she wanted to figure out other things in her life (career, etc.) and was worried that I only started to like her because I knew she liked me.  I tried to convince her that I had been feeling this way for a while (which I have), suggested that there would probably never be a perfect time, and we decided to take things very slowly.  \n\nWe made very tentative plans to hang out on the weekend, and have been texting a little bit since then.  The problem is I can't focus.  I can't stop thinking about her, and am feeling nervous/excited all of the time but I really don't want to mess this up. I've heard people say they've experienced this, but I've never really felt this way about someone before. Also, I am afraid to push too hard when she has already expressed some apprehension. \n\nI want to casually bring up the idea of hanging out again, but I don't want her to feel overcrowded or pushed.  At the same time I want to make my intentions clear that I would really like this to work. Should I let her bring up the idea of hanging out this weekend or suggest something?\nTL;DR:"}

How do I proceed from here?\nPOST: Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this.\n\nI developed feelings for my friend of a year or so a couple of months ago. We met years ago, but stopped talking for a few years. Became friends again a year ago and I consider her one of my closest friends. However, a couple of weeks ago I did something to piss her off (sorry, I can't go into detail what it was). We made up but don't interact like we used to anymore.\n\nBefore the incident, we would talk daily about everything from personal issues to fluff. In person, we would tease each other often and, both physically and verbally. I guess you can call it flirting? I've never been in a relationship before so I wasn't sure how to act during these kinds of situations. After a while, I started to develop feelings for her and felt a really strong connection that I thought might have been mutual.\n\nThen the incident happened and she stopped talking to me for a day. I apologized to her profusely when she gave me the chance to talk to her and afterwards she reassured me that everything is okay, just don't do it again.\n\nBut, my problem is that I feel like everything is not okay. We still hang out with our mutual friends, but it feels like she is actively trying to avoid talking to me or make eye contact. When I message her, she gives short replies; we don't have conversations like we used to.\n\nWhenever I talk to her about this, she reassures me that nothing is wrong. She isn't still mad at me or holding a grudge, she's just been tired and anti-social lately. However, she doesn't seem to have a problem talking to her other friends. \n\nWhat do you think I should do, Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

I do this with my mom, dad (also found out he was cheating on my step-mom this way), and my ex-boyfriends. I know its wrong but anyway, I looked through my current boyfriend's history last night and he was looking at things like hookups on craigslist, dating websites, and escort sites and porn (tmi: czech street girl porn is what he always watches) all in the same night. So I confronted him about it and he said that a guy in his class told him about escort/hookup websites and he was just looking at them for fun. And he got mad at me for looking through his history, which I totally understand, but said that if I did that again we would break up..which just makes me more suspicious. My fear is that because he always watches the czech porn where a guy walks up to random girls and pays them for sex that he may have a sort of fetish about paying for sex or casual sex. Side-notes: I am the only girl he's ever slept with, we have a normal sex life, he is from another country (korea) so its possible that he was just curious about that, but he's very shy and I find it very difficult to picture him talking to anyone in his class, especially about hookups and escorts. Anyways I know I'm probably just being really paranoid because of knowing about my dad's cheating and even my step-dad having an addiction to porn which ended my mom's marriage. But I'm just wondering how I should look at this objectively and where to go from here, we haven't talked since last night. Thanks in advance reddit.\nTL;DR:"}

I got divorced a couple years ago and started this whole red pill philosophy, got tired of that since I was just basically playing games to get what I thought I wanted. Finally started dating a girl I really really liked. That went to shit because I'm an idiot and fell in love with that girl way to quick. So after that, I decided to just enjoy being single. So I stopped playing games with fields and started being straight up about my intentions; I'm not looking for a relationship but I'm down to go on dates and have sex sans any kind of commitment. \n\nSince implementing this into my love life, I've never even imagined it getting to this point. At first it was awesome. Constantly having girls calling me for booty calls on weekends, having tons of options all the time, other men asking what my secret is. It was awesome. Now it's become very very VERY routine. Sec is no longer amazing. Every now and then I'll get with a girl and we have great chemistry and the Sex is fantastic. But 90 percent of the time it's very boring to me. And the girls all go crazy about it though. They are always so amazed at how satisfying Sex is with me.

We've had a pretty normal relationship. We've had our fights, but the good times outweigh the bad by far. We've talked about moving in together, getting engaged and our future together a lot. We were both on the same page. We had a plan. Move in together this summer, get engaged in a year and a half and so on. \n\nSo he just got a new career and with it he's being shipped 800 miles away from me for 6 months. Needless to say that took me a long time to get on board with. He leaves tomorrow and I'm finally at peace with it. Well, as much as I can be. Before he left he was part of a study program so he could pass his Series 7 and Series 66 to be certified before he left. That definitely caused some problems as I felt I was being completely edged out of the relationship. A few weeks ago, I told him that if he couldn't handle both the job and the relationship maybe we should end it. He said he could. But at that point it really didn't matter because he had passed his tests and was preparing to leave. \n\nYesterday, we were talking about how things would be when he got back. We had talked about moving in together when he got back as I live in the area he wants to start his business in. When we talked he said he didn't want to move in together until two years after he got back. And didn't want to get engaged until we had been living together for two years. He said our time linen had to change because he wants to focus on his career and he thinks that I'm keeping him from that by wanting to go to the next step in our relationship. \n\nFrankly, I don't see where I fit in his life with this new career because he'll be focusing on it so heavily (working 7 days a week, working late late nights.) \n\nAm I being rational about thinking that it's completely unfair?

I see that one of my acquaintances on facebook has posted (yet again) a link to a fan-theory about the role the eagles played in Gandalf's \"plan\" in LoTR (all total bullshit, by the way--read the books, would you). To satisfy my thirst for righteous internet ourtrage I click the link so I can read just how wrong it is. The theory mentions something about Isengard and then BAM. All of a sudden memories of the \"they're taking the hobbits to isengard\" video come flooding back to me. Oh man, now I've got to go watch it, for old time's sake. I fire up the youtube and the catchy music starts, I'm reveling in the feels, but then just as Legolas starts telling me where they;re taking the hobbits, I start feeling funny. The looped spinning background of the one shot of legolas gave me some intense spins and I end up vomiting on me computer. Trip down memory lane ruined. So, yeah. Good thing I had a backup keyboard.\nTL;DR:"}

He lives in a house with four other dudes all in their early 20s. \n\nI on the other hand, crazy liberal and love sex but had to move back to my parents' after college. \n\nHe's not what I would have picked out for myself, him being sort of a conservative Christian, but he makes me happy and laugh till I'm tearing up and we get along pretty damn well. \n\nThe problem is, it's starting to feel like things are heating up but despite being two full grown adults, we can never be alone in a normal setting. Sure we can fool around in the back of his car, but it's getting cramped and old. I can bring him home with me and get nasty in my childhood bedroom while my parents watch tv downstairs, which I'm not above doing but is definitely making things awkward. \n\nHis place however is completely off the table. Allegedly the roommates have a deal where they can't have girls in their room with the door closed (found that out after the fact) and now I find out (again after the fact) that he can't even have me there in the house if a third party isn't present. Is this a normal thing among grown men? I'm sort of incredulous about the whole idea. \n\nAlso his roommates have never been particularly warm towards me (never been a problem with exes) and rarely talk to me or really acknowledge my attempts at conversations.

However, it's going to be two MASSIVE pans of lasagna (about 4lbs of meat/4lbs of cheese in each one), and I'd like to do the prep/assembly the day before so I'm not spending the entire day on it (I'm not a very good cook, even following an easy recipe takes me forever). So my question is this: if I'm using \"oven-ready\" lasagna noodles, am I safe to go so far as to assemble the lasagna (with cooked meat sauce, cheese and oven-ready lasagna noodles all stacked in the pan) and then put the pan into the fridge overnight and bake it the next day? Or will that screw things up somehow (do the noodles absorb moisture or something)? Should I bake it a little bit first, then warm it up the next day? \n\nAnother question - the recipe specifies I should cook the meat (and eventually the rest of the sauce) in either a cast-iron pot or an enamel pot (like a Le Creuset). Is that really that important? I don't have a cast iron pot (I know, I'm not a real cook - but I never claimed to be!), and I definitely don't have time to get one & season it before this weekend - and I don't want to spend the money on a Le Creuset just for this dish (despite how awesome it's going to be).

Tonight I called her on facetime like we normally do and she didn't respond to the funny face I usually make at the beginning.\n\nI start talking about mundane things that happened in my day for a few seconds before telling her that I feel bad for ditching her last night. She was extremely upset. She was disappointed that I would lie to her and not come back after an hour like I had said. She said she doesn't know if she could see me the same way anymore. She had stayed up until 1 in the morning waiting for me. I didn't even realize that she would be up waiting. I was selfish and figured she went to bed so I didn't even text her goodnight.\n\nI know it's cliche but this girl is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. She doesn't deserve to be treated this way. Other than not doing it again, how do I make it up to her? I'm thinking of getting to her house tomorrow and waiting for her to get back from work. I figure if I surprise her it would be the opposite of her waiting for me and me never showing up.\nTL;DR:"}

We did it for immigration purposes and I honestly didn't think too hard about it because marriage has always been sort of a meaningless concept to me. Then reality has set in that she wants to be in this for life.\n\nHonestly I'm not in it. She's great - she's pretty and sweet and just about as easy-going as you can imagine. She has 0% of the \"typical girl\" craziness I hear about.\n\nIt's my lack of experience that is eating away inside of me. I feel like if I had just dated a few other girls I would be fine. The idea of *any* other woman excites me, especially a few that I've somehow unhealthily fixated on (a friend of mine, and also my wife's sister who quite maddeningly is better-looking, closer to my age, with larger breasts). I find these other women extremely attractive, more so than I *ever* found my wife.\n\nI don't know what to do.

I wish she would leave me because I feel like I don't have the balls to do it. My family is crazy about her.\n\nDo I suck it up and just power on through till I'm old and dead? I could probably do it, but fuck! Someone please give me some good advice.\nTL;DR:"}

He can also be pretty flirty with other people, but in an obviously joking way. This has never bothered me in the past, it's just who he is, and I know the \"flirting\" is completely harmless and usually with our shared friends. The thing that is starting to bother me though, is that sometimes it feels like there is nothing really \"special\" or different in the way he treats me. Some of the things he says to me, which I know he means seriously, just start to feel empty when you hear him jokingly saying the same things to other people. Even stupid things like petnames, saying \"hey babe\" or \"hey beautiful,\" he says to literally everyone else in conversation. \n\nI'm not insecure about him doing it, it's just when he says something to me and goes to say it to someone else, there's always kind of an \"oh.\" moment for me. It just seems to take away meaning from the stuff he says.\n\nI realize this a pretty stupid, simple problem for this sub, but wanted to know if anyone else has had any experience with this. I have had other jealousy issues in the past with him, which I usually just keep to myself until I get out of my shitty mindset. This only compounds the problem. I don't have much experience with this...he has been with a bunch of people and has had some long-term relationships in the past, whereas asides from an innocent high school bf and some random hookups, this is my first real relationship. Sometimes I can't help but wonder if I would still feel this way if I were on more \"even-ground\" with him, so to speak. But it is what it is.\nTL;DR:"}

Well F said he got annoyed with all the questions and lied and said that I liked her.  I did not know about this and when I found out I was furious. I told F to tell her that he lied. Later after school when I got home I realized it wouldn't be smart to tell her he lied. Well it was too late he told her and she punched and pushed him hard. I realized something was up because I was talking to her friend and G just kept giving dirty looks and wasn't acting normal. F told e that he told her and it didn't really work out. So a couple of weeks later I started getting attracted to her. Well now I can't stop thinking about her and I am probably moving away. I just wish I didn't tell him to say the truth. I want to date her but I know she'll bring it up. Today might have been the last day I saw her and I feel awful. Now I'm pretty sure she doesn't like me and she probably moved on.

Is there a free or low cost method?\n\nI LOVE to work and tonight I came to the reality that either I am getting white collar jobs that don't have a lot of work or all white collar jobs are fairly easy.  That simply isn't enjoyable to me.  I picked finance because I thought I would be working all the time, have a lot of growth, make a decent living, and be working hard against the market.

This guy and I have been friends for a couple of years\u2014always been very close friends who can talk about everything anything (including our respective significant others). And even in the past when we were dating other people, we would be somewhat flirty in a friendship-appropriate way. At one time or another, we acknowledged we had thought about each other in a non-friendship kind of way. But that was the extent. We hadn't said if there were feelings/romantic inclinations etc.\n\nWe both ended relationships last semester (if it's relevant, we both ended them, so I'm less concerned about being a rebound or using him as one). We had both been single for a bit and had been hanging out more and then we started hooking up. We've been what I'd call FWB for a month and a half. A month ago we had a dtr and he told me he wanted to keep things casual. At first I was fine with that. But like in every bad rom-com...I realized that I want more. I care about him. And being FWB means I lose the closeness we had as friends. So either way I want to \"go for it\" or end the hooking up and be friends again.\n\nAnyway, I've resigned myself to being pretty vulnerable and finding a way to tell him what I want, despite how scary that is for me. The last time we dtr'ed was a month ago, so I imagine that's still what he wants. But I'd rather get a bit hurt then continue on this way. But I'm pretty nervous and don't want to chicken out. I'm hoping for any advice about how to approach things. How can I bring it up honestly but not too awkwardly? I've never gone from a friendship to a relationship, only just straight dating before.\n\nI think it's a possibility he would be open to it. It's not hopeless, I just am doubtful. Probably a self-esteem thing/mixed messages we've been sending to each other.\n\nEven any prior experiences good/bad outcomes would be appreciated. Just to hear advice/experience/ways of coping if he says we should just be friends would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

However the past few weeks I was beginning to realize that my feelings for him were getting weaker and weaker. I wasn't sure what was going on, if it was temporary or not, so we decided to go on a break from being around each other so much, figuring absence would clear it up. Sure enough, it did. Only a day had to pass before I was quickly realizing that I was not into it as much as I had been before. The next day, I was hanging out with a friend I used to be into, and it was very unexpected but we kissed. I immediately left this person's house, drove to a parking lot, called the guy I had been seeing, and broke up. I am SO against cheating and never want to be a cheater, which sounds so fucking hypocritical right now. Had I known that kiss would have happened I would have broken up with him before going over. After it happened I called him as soon as possible, because it was obvious that I was interested in seeing other people. (I didn't tell him what happened and I'm not going to, I'm not continuing a relationship with him and it happened 10 minutes prior to me calling him so personally I don't feel it's necessary to inform him of what happened.)\n\nI called my friend later that night telling how guilty and awful I felt, and was surprised to hear that he didn't think I had done wrong. He felt that not only was it the same day that I broke up with the guy but it was within a couple minute time frame, so it's a pretty moot point about the actual technicality of it. He explained that if I had broken up with him 10 minutes before it technically would have been not cheating but it's literally the same situation, and the timing is not worth getting so worked up over. Another friend of mine said the same thing.\n\nI naturally thought in strict guidelines of the crime, but what my friends say kind of has changed my opinion. So now I want the advice from strangers, and I know it's going to be pretty rough but I want to hear.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel like he's changed so much, which is only natural, but anytime I even try speak to him lately he always is too busy or too tired. He keeps telling me I have to be patient until the year is up, but I feel so walked on. I've expressed my unhappiness to him and he dismisses it, telling me to be patient.\nTL;DR:"}

When my boyfriend and I first started dating almost five years ago one of the first things I left over at his house was this towel. It was the best towel I ever had. Thick, plush, and not too soft but not too rough. Well, considering this, my boyfriend refused to let it go. It was his towel now. A few months after we started dating he ended up moving two hours away for his job. He took the towel with him. When we moved in together several months later that towel came along. \n\nFast forward a year and a half. I lose my job. We lose our apartment. We move all of our stuff back to our hometown and he couchsurfs with a friend until he can find a new place and keep working. Somewhere along the way this towel is lost. Boyfriend is sad. I'm sad. As cheesy as it sounds this towel meant a lot to us, and it really was a damn fine towel. It would make me incredibly happy to be able to gift him this towel for Christmas or even our anniversary.\n\nSo far I've managed to locate where the towel came from. Years ago my dad used to work for this very wealthy guy. He used to give us stuff all the time, like clothes, shoes, electronics...and this towel. It comes from a fancy hotel in Boston called XV Beacon. \n\nNow the logical thing to do would be to contact the hotel of course, but I really don't know how I'd approach it. Are hotels willing to sell their towels to non-guests?  I also kind of hope someone here would be able to help out, whether directly or by pointing me in the right direction. Again, I know this sounds really ridiculous but if anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it!\n\nI found this picture of the hotel's towels by the way \n\nThank you in advance, reddit!\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Am I [22 M] getting feelings for my friend [21 F]? What should I do?\nPOST: Okay let me start off by saying I have a girlfriend. We have been together for 3 years now, and we are in a happy relationship. \n\nHere's where it gets complicated. I am good friends with another girl (let's call her Jen) and I think I am falling for her. Normally I would ignore these feelings and probably back away a bit. But so far, I have been trying to do so and it doesn't seem to work. To make things worse (or better), we both got into med school where there's only 40 students and we will be moving away from my home town. Another thing to mention is that I am Indian, and my current girlfriend is from a different part of India, and there is a cultural barrier between my family and hers. She cannot speak in the language my parents speak in, which can be hard at times. Jen, however, is from the same cultural background as me. \n\nNow I do not know if Jen likes me or if she will ever like me. I wouldn't be surprised to be honest if she sees me as a brother. She has also met my girlfriend, and thinks we're \"really cute\" so she probably already set up her own boundary. But I just met her family today and boy did I realize how much easier it would be to fit in. \n\nI know it sounds like my girlfriend and I don't have a strong relationship, but I do honestly love her. She obsessively loves me and wants to get engaged in 2 years. This new girl Jen is just getting me really confused about what I want. I know that I am for sure more sexually/physically attracted to my current girlfriend, and she's definitely a more fun and jolly person. \n\nAnyways, what do yall think I should do here? Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I use to have to help her about once a month or so at the start but since January its now a weekly/fortnightly thing. We've tried changing her food to James Wellbeloved, Acana and Orijen but they've made zero difference (4month trials). Currently shes on four friends, It's not as high quality  but she loves it more than the other 3 and her poops are far more firmer (atleast her first poop of the day is). For the last couple months I've been adding a 1.5 tsp of shredded organic coconut to help firm her stool even further, it is a bit better but it's not made a huge difference for throughout the day. However she doesn't get tear/saliva stains anymore!\n\nSo our previous vet has put her on antibiotics about 4-5 times this last year saying \"next time we flush them\". He never bloody did so after feeling like we were being milked we've now changed vets. First thing she does is flush them !! Bloody finally!! She said \"after the second set of antibiotics not working, it's clear they don't help\" which was my line of thinking. She didn't give us antibiotics this time as it wasn't a severe case of infection by any means.\nAnyways after hearing what we've tried shes says \"if this flush doesnt help, then we can remove them next time if you want\". I feel more confident with this practice, she sounded far more competent and its the biggest and best in Stockholm, it's where all the experts are and where other vets will refer patients to. But Im completely worried about the risks that can come with removal like Incontinence. Im hoping the right gland just needed the flush.

(Worth the read) I was driving off my college's campus when I saw a big hairy spider descend down it's web onto my steering wheel. Alarmed, I started to pull over to the side of the road only using the nubs of my hands. I get out of the car in a panic, forgetting to turn off the car, take it out of gear, and taking out the keys from the ignition. I do, however, pull the parking brake up. Car dies (because it is manual trans) and I begin to pace back and forth for about 10 minutes, I gather a dandelion in hopes it'll help me get the spider out, and begin getting strange looks from anyone driving by. After deciding that a measly little dandelion isn't strong enough to flick the spider out of the car, I decide I should use one of my pencils that is in my bag which is in my car. I attempt to open the Jeep doors, they're both locked. I suppose I must have locked my door by force of habit, as I do anytime I get out of my car. Being a soft top Jeep, I unzip my windows, reach in and unlock my door. I grab a pencil from my bag and begin to, very awkwardly, hold the driver's door open and attempt to flick the spider out of the car.

The thing is, they plan quite a bit of stuff and I almost always agree to their plans and do spend time with them. I'm not the most organized or the best planner myself and I tend to do a lot of things spur of the moment and be spontaneous.  \n\nTo me, I feel like that's just my personality, I'm not big into planning and I like to just do whatever happens on the weekend because it almost always turns out fun.  I have a wide range of friends and I'm a very social person, but I can be introverted as well and I prefer if other people make plans and then I can just join in and invite other friends of mine if its that kind of a party.  I never meant to hurt anyone's feelings or make them feel like I don't make an effort for them, it's just kind of my personality this way. I do spend time with my friends, I just don't always make the initiative to make the plans, especially when they seem to always have something planned.  \n\nAm I a shitty friend?\nTL;DR:"}

He may not consider me a friend?\nPOST: I've known a guy since college started, we are now both midway through our junior year. We both met in the first few weeks of school when we joined the same clubs. We also started working in the same lab on campus at the same time at the end of the first quarter, and both moved to the same research group with a different professor.\n\nI always felt we were friends since we got along fairly well and have hung-out and worked together so long.Sometimes in the past I have felt something feels strange, and wondered if we really were friends, or this was more like a business deal. He wanted to get something concrete out of me, besides friendship. This was a fleeting feeling. I dismissed it.\n\nWe were hanging out and he and his girlfriend had a disagreement and he said \"I don't get anything from hanging out with OP, he only asks for favors.\" I feel hurt by this statement. I don't feel I ask for that many favors. I ask if I could ride home with them after class some days when we have the same class, or if I can meet them when they go home, as we are neighbors.\n\nThat statement makes me feel like he does not consider us friends. Today he was asking my advice for building a camera system and I keep thinking about this conversation. I love talking about this type of thing, its fun, but I feel very hurt by that statement. If you are counting what you get out of a relationship I feel that means you are not friends. Keeping a tally.\nTL;DR:"}

Am I having reasonable doubts about our relationship now?\nPOST: I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 years. I've known from the beginning that she wanted to be in law enforcement, as she comes from LEO family. I love her to no end, and I know I want to eventually marry her. We have awesome communication (except for this) and she's pretty much everything I could hope for in a partner. \n\nRecently we had a discussion with her uncle (who is also LEO) where he described how hard it is to maintain a happy family as a police officer, and he passive aggressively warned her that being a police officer will probably tear us apart. He said this because he knew I value family time very much and my career path is the opposite as hers. I asked her about this later and she didn't want  to talk about it because it was a non issue,claiming he's just projecting his own marital problems onto us and that we will make it work.\n\n I've recently been having doubts about proposing to this girl in a few months because of this. My research hasn't been encouraging either, as many posts say that LEO have terrible family lives (especially women because on top of the hours and stress, many men on the force will try to hook up with her if she's attractive--my girlfriend is very attractive by pretty much all standards). I trust her to not cheat, but other posts are describing its a main reason why women LEO marry other LEO. However are the hours/stress/surrounded by pretty much only men valid concerns, or are my feelings irrationally caused by the other blogs and her uncle?\nTL;DR:"}

This is why I try never to be jealous and have a liberal attitude towards things related to contact with the opposite sex. \n\n I have always been a very communatative, loud, happy-go-lucky guy that got along with almost everyone, regardless of their sex. Naturally, this means I have a healthy mix between guyfriends and girlfriends, my closest friend being a girl, and meet them for coffe at university or talk to them over facebook.\n\n I am also someone who adds everyone that I've met on facebook. My girlfriend, however, doesn't like me talking to other women in my normal, happy, interested, friendly way, because she thinks they might mistake it for flirting and develop feelings for me. \nReassuring that I would never cheat on her, she still doesn't like the feeling of someone else having a crush on me, not because she thinks I would cheat, but because it hurts her feelings, saying that a girlfriend wants to be special and the one and only one for his boyfriend. \n\n She also doesn't like that I'm never jealous about other guys trying to hit on her in real life or over the internet, and thinks that that means that I don't really have strong feelings for her. It doesn't help that her girlfriends encourage her and think the same way.\n\n I will add that she had developed a lesser case of OCD while in her early teens when her father cheated on her mother, which is why I understand where her feelings are coming from, but still can't help feeling distrusted. \nAm I being crazy and is my behavior not normal? Shouldn't I be talking the way I do to other girls?\n\n I will appreciate the help!\nTL;DR:"}

We ended things around the end of October of this year. We decided it was best to spend some time apart from each other because we still want to be together. I plan on marrying this woman and having a family with her, but not anytime soon. \n\nWe chose to end things mutually to give ourselves time to see each other from a different perspective, while we weren't tied down with each other. I was okay with her seeing other guys at the time and so was she. \n \n\nFast forward to now, I find out yesterday that she had sex with one of my friends. What was interesting was that I had seen her Christmas Eve to exchange gifts, and we had sex because we missed each other. And she had sex with my friend the Monday before.  \n\nI know I have no say in her life right now, and she can go ahead and do what she wants, but how am I supposed to react to this? I obviously still love this woman, and she still loves me. We wanted this to happen, but I guess I wasn't fully prepared to handle the situation. She told me that she had no feeling while she was with him. He didn't matter to her. But that still doesn't defeat the fact that she had sex with him.\n\nThe kicker: She plans to see him again tomorrow to hang out because he is leaving for school on Thursday. I know for a fact that they will end up having sex and I honestly don't know how I'm going to feel after that.\n\nRight now, I tend to think that everything is okay, and I'll be fine. But once in a while, I remember what she did and it gets me really depressed. I can't even look at porn the same way anymore because I think about them doing it.\nTL;DR:"}

He brought up marriage, and we agreed we were on the same page about it. But ever since he brought it up that one time, he has been harping on and on about getting engaged. My issues are with the following:\n\n-He seems to be unable to afford an engagement ring. Great, that's fine and I said okay we will just get nice and simple bands for the both of us. Even though he cannot seem to afford an engagement ring and he constantly tries to bring up prices he seems to still want to break the bank to purchase one. I am adamant that he should NOT buy what he cannot afford. He seems to be bringing up cost as some way to try to guilt me. He made me feel so down about it I offered to pay for my own ring in its entirety and he said no. So we politely compromised on just wedding bands. Yet, somehow he keeps bringing up an engagement ring when we have decided not to get one. \n\n- He seems to be having trouble making some nice plan on a way to propose. He keeps talking about it and I get the impression he really doesn't know what to do. So being an understanding human being, I said fine lets just set a date and forget a formal proposal. \n\n- He still has not asked my family member for my hand in marriage and he wants to set a date. I have explicitly said I will not plan unless the most important family member closest to my heart is involved and on our side. \n\nI love my boyfriend and I have been compromising on everything I held dear in my imagination. I don't want a wedding at all, I want a cheap celebration. But I wanted a romantic gesture of a surprise proposal with a ring my future husband could afford. All those hopes and dreams have gone to shit and I feel down. \n\nWhere do I go from here? I have tried talking to my boyfriend numerous times and I am just bummed out.\nTL;DR:"}

I've had absolutely terrible dating luck in my 20 years, so I joined some dating sites. On the newest site I joined, I got a message from a guy (I'm female) and we started talking. Quite honestly, he seemed a little boring, so when he asked to meet up for coffee on Monday, I was hesitant. I sucked it up and I went. It turned out to be the absolute best dating experience I've ever had. We sat at the coffee shop for a couple hours, decided to go to the movies,    which turned out to be closed, then we made out for a minute or two ( he was very sweet about it, and non-aggressive), and he held my hand when he drove me back to my car. While holding hands, I asked him if this meant that he was interested in going out again, and he said, \"Absolutely!\" Since I'm getting my wisdom teeth out this coming week, and he has drill this weekend, we decided to meet this coming weekend. Now, he is 28, and as I stated, he is very dull while texting, that is if he even replies. I know that we're getting along great and we're both looking forward to meeting again, but it secretly bothers me in the back of my mind. Is it normal for older guys to not be into texting so much? He asked me to call him when we exchanged numbers, which I replied with, that I'm not really into phone calls with new people. So I'm hoping he's just better with calling than texting, and that he's not just blowing me off.  I'm just used to friends/dates texting like crazy. I'm completely overreacting, and I know it! I just need some reassurance, I want this to work out so badly! \n\nTurned out long and not short.\nTL;DR:"}

This has not bothered us, and we celebrate our 4 year anniversary this week. We have lived together for years, with him paying electric and water, me paying everything else. He recently graduated college and has been working, making income for the first time in our 4 years together. His income is about 1/4 of mine. We currently have separate accounts, and don't really feel the need for a legally sanctioned marriage. As it stands, we've been trying a system where we pay the same percentage of our salaries for monthly expenses, though I feel like this doesn't leave him with much, while it leaves me with plenty. I end up picking up dinner tabs and most groceries. I'm happy to do it. I know he likes having his financial freedom, but I almost feel like combining accounts is a logical choice in a committed relationship to make things easier on all sides. \n\nI can't help but think if we joined bank accounts, it would make things easier for both of us, but I don't know any non-married people that do this.

This one is about kids. I (25m) have been with my wife (25f) for only a year, but it's important to think ahead.\n\nWe both have clearly agreed that we aren't yet ready, and won't be for years. l know she definitely wants them at some point. I grew up under the impression that I would marry and have kids, it's just what you do. And we went through the course of our relationship understanding that we would have them someday. Since being married, I feel like the idea of having kids gets farther and father away from my vision of the future, whenever I think about it. It feels horrible that my idea about something like this may have changed.\n\nOne of the big worries that I have is that I will inevitably delay my decision to have kids until it doesn't happen and we move on or it accidentally happens and I have to accept it. Nobody is ever ready, and I hear all the time that it ends up being the best thing to happen to them. Yet, it's not just me not being \"ready.\" I'm terrified of the thought.  l fear that neither of us are mentally fit for a child. I'm uncomfortable around kids, from age 0 to 14 or older. l don't have any sort of instinctual drive to carry on my family name.  The way that we handle rough times now (and we've had a lot) makes me seriously fear raising anything more then a dog.\n\nAre these normal fears for young couple that doesn't want kids *yet*?

I've been dating an older guy who makes over 4x what I make. At first it didn't bother me that we go dutch on every meal but now it does for a few reasons:\n\n1. He always wants to eat at places I can't afford and it really annoys me that he suggests these restaurants when he knows my budget. He doesn't offer to pay for the place either so I don't get why he brings it up. It makes me feel really poor and inadequate everytime. \n2. Quite simply I'm traditional and like it when a guy treats me to dinner and shows me that he cares through paying for me. I like giving attention through lots of verbal affirmations and helping with errands and housework. You can judge me if you want but that's just what I like. My last boyfriend was very traditional in this way too and I loved it. \n3. It feels like he doesn't put in an effort. He's not very verbally affectionate which is another way I like to receive affection. I know he likes me and I know this is just how he is as a person but I'm the kind of girl who likes verbal affection so if I'm not going to be getting affection through dinners, I'd like it in another way that I enjoy. \n\nI don't want to bring this up with him because I feel like it's wrong of me to ask for his money. Do I break up with him instead? It feels like this has long term implications as well.

Everything was fine when i left on Sunday night.\nI texted her on Monday and she just wasn't texting like she normally did. it wasn't one word answers but it wasn't like she was interested in keeping the conversation. So the same thing starting happening Tuesday so i called her to see what was up, she said everything was fine. So i thought that was that but she is still doing the same thing as Wednesday and Thursday. I don't know what to do. I think I'm going to try and not text her this weekend and see what happens. I don't know if i'm just overthinking things because i tend to do that, or if something is actually wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

I want to ask her to hang out, but it's also complicated because that ex-boyfriend of hers is seeing someone else too. She doesn't want to be his second option, but she hasn't fully let go yet.\n\nI feel like the timing might be kind of bad to ask her out, because of the  currently complicated status of hers. Also, she goes to a different university than me. Once summer ends, I won't really have a chance to ask her to hang out.

I am very jealous of my current crush's family's money. I feel jealous of his lack of mental health issues. I was very jealous of my ex's athletic ability, which is something I had never cared about before or since. I have been jealous about how well they have fit in with life and their peers in general. Their lives always seem so perfect for some reason. \n\nAnd it's *so* annoying and also makes me feel ashamed of myself and my life, in the sense of feeling so inferior that I am embarrassed. Like, I suck and so does my life. I always feel like a huge bitch because of this. I sometimes try to teach myself skills (programming, music, etc.) to maybe make them feel bad and myself feel better. This was not entirely conscious, which is sort of scary. \n\nI think I am pretty nice to them, overall, but I do treat them noticeably more poorly. People tell me that the difference between how I treat my SOs and how I treat everyone else is bigger than the average person. And, admittedly, I do treat people very nicely because I am very eager to be seen as nice. I also want people to love me, so I feel like I have to give everyone a constant stream of compliments and favors. A bit off topic, but potentially relevant.\nTL;DR:"}

(X-posted r/relationships)\nPOST: We met over thanksgiving break, spent that whole weekend in bed together. We both then went away to different colleges for about two weeks and texted almost constantly that entire time. Once we got home, we met up a lot over break. I think the longest we went without seeing each other was 3 or 4 days. However, the constant texting stopped and now that we're both back at school it's hard because I miss talking to him. During the time where we were constantly texting, he expressed interest in possibly wanting something more in the future.\n\nIt seemed like things were moving pretty fast I guess, but it seemed right at the time. Now that we're not texting as much anymore (and I see him being active on other social media so I know he's not just not texting me because he's too busy), it's kind of making me think that he's lost the feelings from the beginning while I'm still left here with them.\n\nI planned on asking him how he felt about us or just telling him how I felt before we both went back to school but I pussied out. This past week, he didn't text me once until I texted him, and he told me he missed me and had a lot of fun over break with me, and asked me when my next break was so he could see me again. We texted for a little while and then he stopped answering me.\n\nI guess I'm just really confused on where to go from here. I want to say something but I don't want to scare him away. We haven't really gone on a proper date at all even though we talked about it in that initial period, every time I tried to bring it up over break he never got back to me. Him and his ex broke up in August so I'm thinking there could still be potential for us to have a relationship, but it just being too soon right now. Or if I should just move on and let it go. Any advice would be great! \n\nAnd if I do say something now while we're both at school how should I go about doing it and saying it?

Me being an spaniard and having this cute tradition of the grapes, I was wondering about those little things that other countries may have too.\n\nHere in Spain, we have a tradition that I suppose is called \"the twelve grapes\" and is done because it gives good luck. It consists of all the family grouping up in front of the television some minutes before the clock hits midnight, with 12 grapes in hand, and when the clock hits 00:00, you have to eat a grape for each bell strike. I love this and I always do it while giggling at everyone trying to stuff their mouths with grapes. After the 12th bell strike, everyone starts greeting, you can hear the fireworks going on and the alcohol bottles opening up. For me it's magical.\n\nAlso, it's a great excuse for each TV channel to create their production of a New Year's show, with humour, dances, with all the artists invited, that will make way to the main show that is La Plaza del Sol in Madrid where there will be two main hosts explaining how to eat the grapes (even though everyone knows how to do it) and you can sense the hype with all the people with silly hats in front of the clock tower. There's always a fight between TV companies to have the best invited artists, hosts or content in general, because hell, they can make a lot of money out of it and all the damn families of the country are glued to the screen. I don't know if this happens everywhere in the world.\nTL;DR:"}

There is this concert that I really want to go to but I would be going with this girl I had a fling with 5 years ago. We are still friends even though we don't see each other so often but that's beside the point.\n\nLet me just explain a little bit of my background. When I was with her, my mother (don\u00b4t ask me how she knew, I still don't know) said that she pretty much knew that something was up and that she \"trusted me to do the right thing and behave myself\". A while later, she pressed me for details and I admited that we had a brief thing but later I backtracked out of embarassment and said that it wasn't anything.\n\nMy mother, a year later or so, asked me if I was more sure about my sexuality and I brushed it off, saying that I was more focused on studying than anything. She was happy about that and it became a dirty little secret, if you will. It was never brought up again.\n\nThis brings us to the present, I was invited by this girl to go to a concert and I really want to go. I still live with my parents and I'm finishing college so I'm financially dependent and they still have veto power over me. Either I come clean and risk getting myself into an awkward situation or I lie, which I hate, and risk getting caught, which would destroy the trust my parents have in me.\n\nI would have to tell my mother that I would be going with her. That or I would have to lie and say I would be going with someone else. I'm sorry if this is a little confusing, but I'm as confused myself.\nTL;DR:"}

She was one of the few people I could really connect to on a higher level, both socially and intellectually, which really made us grow really close this past spring. I grew really attracted to her, and thought that she felt the same way. \n\nBut I never made a move though, because there were times where she seemed to reject me if I put my arm around her, but more importantly, she was going abroad for the fall semester. We were going to be around 5 hours apart for the summer too, and it just didn't make sense for me to try something right before we each went home. \n\nThroughout the summer we talked all the time, and she visited me (and her other friend), and I did the same later. We always had great times, but again I never made a move, which of course I regret greatly. \n\nSince the summer we've talked intermittently, some days all the time, others not at all which I'm fine with. Many times I've made the decision to move on because I know I screwed up, but every time she starts talking to me it's hard to do so. \n\nSometimes we talk on a solely friend-to-friend basis but at other times she seems flirty, and it always confuses me. \n\nWhat should I do here?

However, one problem that's been stifling our relationship has been a lack of communication. I'd say the problem is definitely both of our faults. On my part, I think it is because I am a non-confrontational person. I often feel strained or nervous to tell her things because I worry that it might lead to an argument. I'm not exactly sure where the problem lies on her part, but I can tell she feels strained to tell me things sometimes.\n\nFor example, a little while ago we got caught in some drama involving my ex and her best guy friend. During that time period, she didn't really tell me how she felt, and because I'm oblivious as a rock, I couldn't tell there were things she was angry with me about. She eventually just blew up on me one night and yelled at me for things from months ago. This was the only incident where our lack of communication dealt a blow to our relationship, but I feel that if we don't fix the problem soon it will cause much bigger problems down the line.

I have read a little bit from other posts here on Reddit and most people say that they would have liked an open bar and a better venue.\nTL;DR:"}

My example:\nI had to get my car registered in Colorado.  On the first trip to the DMV they were unable to register me because i had to get my emissions checked.  *sigh* fair enough.  Got my emissions done that day, but was too late to go back to DMV.  The next day its a different person with a new problem, \"oh you have Nebraska insurance (still on parents insurance) you will have to get a Colorado agent blah blah.\"  I had registered in CO 3 other years on the same NE insurance, but the woman refused and blamed the other people for ignorance, even though i had present the insurance the other day and had not heard about this issue.  Dejected I left feeling upset having wasted something like 4 hours of my life with nothing to show.  Anyway I talked to our NE agent and parents, I I end up CALLING the DMV to clarify the problem and a nice  man is able to take care of all of it over the phone and mail me my stickers; He didn't even request the emissions report.  A few weeks later he called to make sure I had received them. For the inhuman hell that is the DMV this was very refreshing and a great victory!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me (17 F) and my two guy friends (16 M), one of them being my ex. I'm not sure how to proceed...\nPOST: So for some background, I have been friends with these two guys (we'll call them A and M) for the past two years or so. We met through mutual friends online and have been gaming together throughout the duration of our friendships. Eventually it got to the point where we all hung out at each other's houses and watched movies or whatever. \n\nDuring this last summer, M and I began talking more so than usual. Eventually feelings began to blossom. Half way through August, M and I started dating. \n\nOur relationship was incredible, I could not express how happy I was with how great M treated me and how we worked together. However, as we began to hang out more, we also began to hang out with A more. \n\nNow, A and M have been friends since birth. They are super close, and I know they respect each other deeply. \n\nThe issue here is, I started developing feelings with A over the past month. A admitted to those same feelings for me about two weeks ago. Realizing that this was probably not the best for our relationship and that M didn't want to keep an LDR with me in college (so we would have broken up anyways), I decided to bring up breaking up to M a week ago. We agreed on a mutual break up. It was very clean, not very emotional, and we got to keep our rather good friendship. We basically agreed that it wouldn't work out because of the eventuality of college. However, I am not sure how I should go about a possible relationship with A. The attraction is still there on both sides, but I guess we are both worried about hurting M in the process. I can completely understand where A comes from, and I have no desire to break apart their friendship...but I wonder if there's still a chance for us.\nTL;DR:"}

Today, during a routine traffic stop, the policeman noticed an open container in the back seat of the car. My sister (also my coworker) used her company discount to rent the car, so she could be in deep trouble if I happen to get a ticket for this.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.  But I think it's the little details that really get me such as like where do I tell her?  Her house or mine?  Or is it better to meet at a restaurant? Or is the restaurant awkward because it can take a while to eat? \n\nAlso, since we have been meeting at eachother's house for the last 3 years, wouldn't it be awkward and obvious if you asked them to meet you at a park all of a sudden? I would feel that after I've said \"Can you meet me at ______?

It makes me very uncomfortable that he's so insecure.\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months. We often lay around his apartment without shoes, but we've never really stood next to one another without shoes on. Yesterday we stayed in and we decided to cook together. When we were cooking, we were obviously standing and I realised that he's about 2\"-3\" shorter than me. I'm 5'6\" and I thought that he was 5'7\", but apparently he's more like 5'4\". I went and looked a pair of his shoes and they have about a 3.5\" heel. It's not like a removable heel lift, it's built in. I didn't even know that lifts were a real thing, I thought people only used them if one leg was longer than the other. \n\nHe's been wearing lifted shoes this whole time! It makes me uncomfortable that he is so insecure with his height that he would wear them. One of the main reasons I liked him is because I thought he was really confident. The part that I am angry about is that he's basically been lying this whole time. If I knew he was shorter than me I probably wouldn't have dated him in the first place. I don't like the fact that he's shorter than me, it just feels weird. I don't want to look down at him. I'm not sure if I should end our relationship. The main thing is that he's insecure about it, the fact that he feels the need to hide it is such a turn off. I'm not sure if I can look at him the same way again.\n\nI would appreciate some advice.\nTL;DR:"}

The most we had done was a little making out and we enjoyed each others company. This started in June and occurred throughout the month till July.\n\nSo Kelly goes to school in Colorado and I live in Texas. She was just down in Texas for the Summer where her pare ts live. I knew the long distance discussion was going to be inevitable but I thought we were going to at least wait till nearer the end of July to talk about it. She said at the beginning of July she is unsure of pursuing this relationship because of long distance and she gets insecure in that kind of relationship.\n\nAt this point I'm pretty sure long distance isn't going to happen, I'm okay with that. I just want to stay in contact with her because she was incredibly fun and maybe potentially pick up the relationship again in a few years. Yet, right now she isn't responding to my texts. The last thing she said to me was \"I don't know what to say or what to do.\" She had always said at the beginning of the relationship how awkward and nervous she gets talking about stuff. I just can't get her attention to talk about it.\n\n How do I approach this situation and hopefully get her to just stay in contact (Facebook friends, snapchat, etc...). As of now we are still friends on snapchat and she views my posts.\nTL;DR:"}

Ex is 21, F.\n\nLong version:\n\nI just came across [this] post on r/bestof, and the girl in the post on r/okcupid is my ex (she shared her reddit username with me while we were dating). We met on OKC and dated for about two months. Even though the relationship wasn't that long, we connected on a pretty deep level and I felt a stronger connection with her than I had with anyone else I have dated. Two months in, she broke up with me *while we were having sex*. Mid-coitus. Her reason for breaking up with me was that she felt like she had to be alone so that she didn't feel like she was having to be responsible to another person in her life.\n\nShe went on to tell me that she isn't really as well-adjusted and doesn't really have her life together as much as it seemed she did, and was simply hiding a lot of stuff from me (actively relapsing with an eating disorder, depression, other stuff). She then tells me that she wants to go back in to therapy and work on these issues so that she can give us another shot because she thought I was an amazing guy and didn't want to date anyone else. I take her at her word (mistake number 1). I saw her at the beginning of October (the breakup was in early August) and it seemed like she wanted to give things another shot. We kissed, held hands, and were generally couple-y. And now I've stumbled across this post. \n\nThe description the guy gives of their interaction thus far sounds almost identical to what I was like when I first met her, and part of me wants to message him and warn him, because I'm pretty sure the same thing will probably happen to him. I realize that I'd probably just look crazy. I don't know what to do, and this whole misadventure has really rekindled a lot of the pain I felt with the breakup.\nTL;DR:"}

Very close friends, often staying up until 4am on Skype after a game of Cards Against Humanity. Same dark sense of humor, similar tastes in partners, and I've known her for a while - bare-bones, I know, those are just a few of the reasons I like her.\n\nTwo months ago I noticed I started to develop romantic feelings for her. She was in a relationship at the time so I didn't express how I felt because I didn't want to complicate things with her. Now that she is single again, my feelings for her have flared up and I'm unsure how to deal with them.\n\nIt doesn't help that there are other men interested in her - one of them even tried to kiss her two days ago. There are about six guys in total who like her, including her ex-boyfriend. I kept these feelings bottled up because I didn't want to add to the total and just be another thirsty guy chasing after her.\n\nYesterday I wound up telling her I liked her and we talked about it on Skype for most of the early morning. She never gave an explicit opinion either way and said she found that I liked her \"interesting\", also mentioning that she just needs some time to clear her head after her break-up because she wasn't sure how she felt about getting into another relationship so soon after her previous one.\n\nI would like to be friends with her - she means a lot to me and I don't want to lose her. She mentions that we're still at the same place we were - just friends - but I'm worried that my crush on her will have a negative impact on our friendship.\n\nI'm following the obvious advice - give her some space, don't pressure her into a choice, and I don't want to pursue her. I want to be rid of these feelings for someone who isn't interested in reciprocating, and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be very helpful.\nTL;DR:"}

I always pretended it was a video game, either normal gameplay (walkthrough) or an interview/review of some kind and had a dialogue in my head related to it. It was usually about the tech, there were cool features, over the top physics and stuff, even though it was just me sliding down the hill. That imaginary game had a sequel every winter and they formed their own chronology in my head.\n\nHowever, when I got older, I didn't forget, but the game series was different. It was something beyond lines of life simulation, your choices affecting your life and goals which you had to fulfill. It was from the same developers (and part of the chronology). When in upper-elementary school, I would again describe the game to myself, or go through an interview dialogue, and come up with new features. \n\nNowadays I'm an adult. Again, the same chronology and big technological advancements. The concept is the same life simulation kind of thing as when I was younger, but with a plot instead of being open-ended. As always, it doesn't affect my outer life, but probably anything can put me in between a game walkthrough or gameplay stream in my mind, but also pop me out from there. Basically, anything that happens in my life probably gets into a part of the game, but it doesn't go the other way. I live how I like to live, and I'm not forced to do or not to do thing because it doesn't fit my imaginary video games. The games always expand or get a sequel or dlc or something which makes them possible to feature new things.\nTL;DR:"}

Our current roommate, we'll call her Sally, is kind of a brat and it's totally not working out. \n\nHowever, we don't want to be mean about it. \n\nSally likes to party, hang out, smoke weed, come in at 3am in the morning, and have loud sex at 5am thereafter. Not a huge problem for a 21 year old, but the rest of us have done the college scene and are settling into our jobs or focusing on other things. The problems stem from her bringing home strangers she's met on Tinder, having friends leave at 5am in the morning, being considerably loud and the aforementioned.\n\nConversely, the rest of us enjoy movie night and having friends over before 2am; parties when the occasion arises and hardly IF EVER being inconsiderate about noise/drugs/etc, especially when someone has to be somewhere in the morning.\n\nAnother thing is that two of us in the house own everything as far as couch, tv, fridge, kitchen ware, netflix, etc., etc. And, granted, she is more than welcome to use any of it. But leaving other people's stuff on and not taking care of things is bad character.\n\nIn any case, I don't think any of us want to be assholes about it. We've definitely all lived with other people before and know the tests some of us have put each other through only to become the best of friends afterward.\n\nHow can we approach her when the time comes at the end of our lease (probably 30 days notice) and cut ties with her cordially?\nTL;DR:"}

As an intern, I get paid the equivalent of 40 US dollars a month. Yes, 40.\n\nNext year, I will start my residency. In my country, at that age, all males must serve a 2-year military service, which is virtually unpaid (same pay as internship, give or take). It will prevent me from earning, and learning, as it will take me away from my residency, where I receive my training. And in peace time, army doctors usually spend time on a desk filling paperwork about the supplies of the unit pharmacy.\n\nOne way around this is to accept a scholarship to do a masters abroad (I'm thinking Australia or NZ). This is legal. I can get my military service deferred for a few years, that way. \n\nIf I stay out of the country for  a couple of years after the end of that deferment, I can pay a fine, and I don't have to do the military service anymore. It drops off at age 30.\n\nIs this unethical? It feels like I'm not fulfilling a national duty, but in the meantime the alternative is 2 years of slave-work and no pay, and living with my parents in a country which is going through shit (the arab spring thing), while I could be doing a masters in a respectable university, and possibly start a career.\nTL;DR:"}

He was a little socially awkward, but since I'm no beacon of social confidence, I always try to give those guys a chance. He ended up asking me over to watch a movie and I agreed.\n\nHe lived about six blocks away, walk up to his house. Everything seems fine. House looks ok, not the nicest, but the yard is decently taken care of and it seems perfectly fine. \n\nThen we walk inside.\n\nThe first thing I notice, before the lights have even been turned on, is the smell. It was like rotting food with urine with a very strong spicy smell. Lights turn on, the place is a wreck. Garbage everywhere, dishes and plates that looked like they had been there for months, a stack of pizza boxes almost to the ceiling, with visible rotting pizza still in them. The smell was so strong I could taste it. \n\nMy plan was to go to the bathroom, fake some sort of food poisoning and get the hell out of there. So I ask to use the washroom. Big mistake. There was actually a huge gaping hole in the floor that I almost fell in, and when I walked over to the toilet, the floor sagged so much I just jumped back away (I am not a heavy person, if anyone is curious). After a couple minutes of gazing at this sight, I flush the toilet, and try washing my hands. This stream of yellow-brown liquid comes streaming out of the tap. Nope. \n\nSo I walk out, clutching my stomach, and say I think I should go home. He seems pretty upset, but oh well. So I grab my shoes and head for the exit. Just then this malnourished, mangy, disgusting cat comes walking over. This cat looked like it was doomed to die any minute. I looked at the guy and remembered him saying that he had had three cats and two dogs, but only one cat remained. I bolted out, called animal services immediately and deleted his number.\nTL;DR:"}

I really have no idea what those places are like, who she went with, and what happened when she was there. Half the time I think about it it's super hot, the other half it's intimidating and a little squicky. I also have an inkling that she went with one of her close friends.\n\nSo far this is a pretty stupid/simple question. The problem is that I tend to get jealous, and prior to this I was in a toxic relationship with a lot jealousy back and forth. So while I'm aroused/intimidated/squicked, I'm also not sure that I want to know the details. I don't want to go back to those feelings I had in the toxic relationship, where I obsessed over details of her history long past.\n\nI know this sounds a little silly, but I'm really confused as to whether I should ask her about this or let it be. I'm usually very pro-leaving-the-past-be, but I can't get this out of my head. It's at a point where she notices I'm a little off and asks what's up. I don't really want to be in possession of sex club details (\"oh yeah, I gave my friend a blowjob while 8 dudes watched\") that I can obsess over.

We are a good 18 hr drive away from her home and she can't get off enough time to go home for the holidays.\n\nLately she has expressed sadness about not being able to be home for Christmas as this will be her first holiday away. I generally try to sympathize as best I can but it doesn't mean as much to me and I don't understand the holiday in fully as some would. \n\nRecently I had the idea that I might decorate the room and bring a little bit of Christmas to it and surprise her when she gets home from work tomorrow or the next day. She plans on cooking a big dinner for us. My question is if anyone has any advice on ways I could make the room Christmas-y(?) Or just in general ideas to make her feel like Christmas is still here for her?\n\nAs a not probably not anything to extravagant as I am on a tight budget of late.\nTL;DR:"}

When he was in middle school, he played football. His coaches would yell cuss words at him along with other insults about his weight. This has caused him to resent cussing. As for alcohol, he and his family were hit by a drunk driver when he was a child. He also watched his brother become an alcoholic and throw his life away. Tattoos are just a matter of his personal preference. \n\nI am not allowed to do any of these.\n\nI grew up in a home in which cussing was just a part of everyday language. I used it around my parents because it was accepted. Ive suggested I simply not cuss when im around him so he doesnt have to hear it but he wont even let me do that.\nBecause I have never had a traumatic experience with alcohol, I see no reason that a single drink at dinner would be wrong. \nAll the women in my immediate family (3 not including me) have at least one tattoo of the birthday of my littler sister who died in 2009. This is something I want and believe is important. \nBut I can't do any of it because it's not what he finds attractive. \nI understand love requires sacrifice but can we not compromise? Or  should I just be happy to give up 3 things I want the freedom to do?\nTL;DR:"}

At one point, that friendship started going in the direction of being more but it just wasn't a good time for her (still dealing with past issues). Things got kinda weird for a little while but eventually went back to normal.

Then, I handled it completely wrong and tried cutting her off, hoping I'd finally get over my feelings for her if she wasn't around anymore. For almost a year after, I dealt with her sending extremely mixed signals, even though she said she'd give me the space I wanted. I also made it worse because I was extremely inconsistent. I claimed I wanted space but would never fully block her and reply when she'd try and contact me.   \n\nEVENTUALLY, I think she just kinda gave up and we have not spoken in well over a year. We are now juniors in college, go to school about 2000 miles away, and the only interaction we've had is a few likes on some form of social media. \n\nHowever, I woke up this morning to a text from her (she sent it super late and I was asleep). It's kinda long but she basically said she misses me, hopes I'm doing well, and that she would love to facetime or something if I was willing to. I replied saying thanks, hoped she was doing well also, and that I'd enjoy catching up sometime. She read the text fairly fast but just ignored it. Like, over a year of nothing, she sends a late night text, then ignores me when I respond. What the F*CK?\nTL;DR:"}

She had a boyfriend, but I always knew that she and I would have a chance together, so it didn't bother me too much. About 8 months ago, (2 months after she'd broken up with her boyfriend) things started heating up between her and me, and it was pretty obvious. This went on for two months before she and I really talked directly about our feelings for each other and we both decided we should be together. That was the best.\n\nThe next week she went on a school trip and when she got back she texted me (I was in a different state in the US) that she wanted to 'rewind' a bit. After getting back to school, she said we'd talk, but she put it off for a long time. She basically decided she wanted to be with someone she met on the trip instead. \n\nShe's made an attempt since to try to make things better by explaining, and honestly it did help, but I decided that I was done with her and to cut her out. For the most part it's worked, but anytime I see her, or any time she texts me it makes me really sad because of how things were when we were so close, and when we decided to be together, but now that's all ruined. She's kindly making attempts to be nice, and deep down I want her to, and I want things to be better, but I know that I cannot separate my feelings for her and just friendship. Should I explain this to her, and ask her just to leave me along? It makes me sad to know how everything has fallen apart, but her attempts (which deep down inside I want) make me sad. She's a good person, and I don't want to be mean, I just wish things were different and that she didn't make me sad now. We graduate in 3 weeks.\nTL;DR:"}

His parents divorced when he was 17 at which point he started smoking pot. Since then, he's messed around with various hallucinogens and psychedelics along with continuing to smoke. His use went on and off along with getting jobs, starting school, etc, but it never really stopped until we started dating. The last time he did anything was experimenting with X after we met, but shortly before we started dating. \n\nI am not okay with him doing any drugs at all. My worry isn't that he'll do drugs at some point while we're together (which would be an immediate deal breaker). My worry is that he stopped doing drugs because he's with me, and in the end, he's still the type of person who would be up for trying something new. Again, my worry isn't that he WILL do drugs, but that he'd be up for it if it weren't for me. \n\nAt this point in our relationship, I'd like to start thinking realistically about what a future together would look like. This issue doesn't affect our relationship day to day, but when I think about things on a grander scale, this really bugs me.  It makes me really uneasy about our relationship and possibilities of a future as a whole. Am I being crazy about this, or am I allowed to be genuinely concerned? \n\nLast minute clarification: I did not know that he had ever had any involvement with drugs when we started dating. I actually thought he was a much different person than that. He told me about it all a few weeks into our relationship, and I expressed my opinions on drugs (I never forbade him from doing anything, but I did make it clear that doing drugs again was a deal breaker). At the time I didn't really have a problem with it for a few reasons. I was shocked and hadn't really processed what I'd heard, I thought he was a different person now, and he made it seem like it all happened a long long time ago. I found out a few months later that anything had happened recently, but it only happened rarely.\nTL;DR:"}

One spectacular lifestyle inflation later, he drove away with a brand new 2013 Ford Escape Titanium 4WD - yes, the most expensive version. How was he able to pull it off?

How easy was that!?\n\nPayments started - *CDN$324 bi-weekly for 72 months @ 2.49%.*\n\n20 months later - so yesterday - his dad let him know how the cosign was hurting his credit and his ability to get a good rate on a new mortgage. Roommate visited Ford today to get him out of the cosign. They requested a $450 \"signing fee\". Outraged and unable to pay for it (yay living paycheck-to-paycheck!), he and his parents found another way: *get the bank to finance the vehicle.*\n\nLong story short, the bank gave him a **shitty** deal:\n\n*$312 bi-weekly for 60 months (so 8 more months than original) @ 5.49%.*\n\nAnd he was PROUD!

Probably, I don't personally know. Anyway, ignorance is bliss... so I won't tell him about my \"discovery\" on Excel, I don't want to make him feel like shit - plus I'm not sure if he had any other choice (other than paying $450). At least his dad will be able to afford a great house!\nTL;DR:"}

My face would light up everytime she texted me and couldn't wait to see her even if we had just seen each other.\n But then after a few months she ended it, she said she just wanted to be friends. After that I responded the worst possible way, lots of meaningless sex and even more drugs, usually at the same time. We remained friends and everything and there weren't really hard feelings, I was just terribly depressed. The thing that got me the most is that she would say she missed us and how I was the only one who could ever make her feel the way she did.

Were still friends of course but I really wish we could be something more. I can live without her, its just she makes my life so much better. I'm kinda rambling at this point.

I just didn't care. You could forget about participating in extra-curicculur activities. Only now, halfway through Junior year, have I realized that I actually love learning. I love the feeling of learning something new and understanding concepts, and getting my work done. I was always told I'm smart, and as a result never really felt like I needed to apply myself, until now. I had this revelation when I started making friends who were in AP classes and did many extra-curriculur activities. For the first time in my life I began to feel intellectually inferior to my peers. This feeling has since made me kick into gear, stop being a lazy dimwit, and get my stuff done. All my grades in all my classes are on a steady incline towards straight As. I've volunteered at the local soup kitchen and now I'm joining the local EMS, something I've actually been interested in since middle school. I love the feeling of improvement, but I still have this nagging feeling of inferiority anytime I think about my friends who are much better students then me. The feeling of never being able to go back, change things, and ever be better than they are sucks. But I always remind myself that I'm still getting better than I have ever been, and that keeps me going. I really want to get into school and be an electrical engineer. Electronics have always fascinated me and being able to be a part of the design process would be my dream. Anyways, to get to the point, has anyone been in a similar situation? Also, is there a chance I could still get into a good school? I'm willing to do as much as it takes to make up for my mistakes, and I want nothing more than to make it up to my parents.

We're both very passive and non-confrontational. When I had things that bugged me (household chores, lack of time together, lack of sex), I would avoid confronting her about them until I couldn't stand it and would break down to her (about every 6 months). Needless to say, I didn't understand the extent this hurt her and why we rarely found solutions.\n\nWe also don't communicate very well. We're both very internal people and have trouble opening up on our own. This led to some very terrible feedback loops, the major being with intimacy. She stopped initiating sex (libido changes, wanting me to take charge) which made my anxiety about it worse, leading to long stretches of drought as we both wanted the other to take the lead.\n\nSo, my wife is worried that we need different things out of a marriage partner than someone who is exactly the same.

I want to tell her to just come home, but if I don't actually want to see her I feel like that would be rude to do since it would cost a lot to change flights. Should I ask her to come home? I would like to see her a couple times but I want time mostly to myself to see if I can forgive her. \n\nWhat can I do to stop feeling like shit? I just keep thinking of her blowing him over and over and I want to ask her for the details but I don't know if that would just make me sadder. What can I do to get over the feeling that this is my fault? (I know it is not, but I still feel somewhat like of I had been better this wouldn't have happened).\n\nWhat am I supposed to do if we have sex, I would not be able to stop thinking about the cheating. How can I try and move forward with the relationship without just making her feel like shit over and over for what she did? I don't want to fight with her but I just feel so destroyed inside.

And that it was not good enough that he just remove them-- they want him to remove them and then contact them for a \"retroactive license\" to the photographs .\n\nWhat he did was basically link to a video on you tube with a cute animal that had been being passed all over the place (facebook, buzzfeed, etc) and then wrote an article with his feelings on the video and included an accompanying picture reiterating his point (the same picture that had being passed around facebook, etc.)\n\nHe's concerned because he registered the website in his own name (which they spelled wrong in this demand letter) and he doesn't want to lose his house or something serious over this shit. But I feel like it is a total shakedown. In fact, googling said lawfirm it seems like they send out thousands of these letters every month and people have posted that they \"pay them 500 dollars just to make them go away.\"\n\nHe's taken down the pictures, the article, the link, the everything.  What should he do now? It isn't a famous animal (not, like, grumpycat) and he actually had some positive interactions over facebook with the family that owned the animal at the time it was going viral (they shared the link to his page and article because they thought it was clever.) \n\nMy friend hasn't used the image for anything that would make him money-- he hasn't made tshirts, claimed to own it,  or anything like that.

We have happily lived in our apartment for a couple years now without a single issue with management.\n\nLast week, management sent out a letter stating they will be providing new furniture to residents who pay a $20 monthly fee (note this comes out to $960 a year for each four-bedroom apartment). Other apartment complexes in the town have been replacing their furniture in the past year or two without charging residents, and we think this is absolutely preposterous. \n\nWill there be ramifications if we write a letter outlining how the apartment complex is screwing its residents over and put a copy of the letter on every single door?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [30 F] think my in laws are talking bad about me, not sure what to do\nPOST: My husband and I were having an argument a few days ago about some issue that we've now resolved, but he said something like \"I'm always defending you to my family!\" like it proved how much he cared or whatever. What I took from that was: his family talks shit about me enough that he has to defend me on a regular basis. To my face, his family has always been nice to me, so it never occurred to me they may feel otherwise. When I mentioned it and pressed him on it, he tried to down play it and basically backpedal, but I just can't get past it. I've never criticized his family. That just seems like such a shitty thing to do!\n\nI'm sure the whole things stems from him talking to his family about our marital issues. Not that we have huge marriage problems, but he goes to them with everything. Which, on the one hand, it's great that he's so close to them. But on the other, I have to maintain a relationship with these people and when he tells them every problem we're having, it poisons the well. They hear one side of the story and it makes me look like crap. I don't go to my family with marriage issues. For one thing, it's not really their business. For another, I want them to like my husband! I don't want them to remember the time he did this immature thing or said this cruel thing. \n\nSo I guess I have a couple of questions: What should I do now that I know they talk about me? I don't feel comfortable around them. I still want my kids and my husband to have a good relationship with them (and I don't want them to see me as \"the bitch who never comes over\").

And by 'local' I mean that it's a 1 hour bus trip away.  I must add here that I'm not a big fan of football and haven't played in years.\n\nAll was going well until I decided to show off my non-existent football skills.  I ended up slipping off the ball and falling on my elbow.  Hard.\n\nAt first I thought it was nothing, but as time went by the pain got worse and I could barely move my elbow.  Nevertheless, I brushed it off and went on with my day. \n\nI got home at 9:30pm (by bus) and at this point I could barely move my arm.  My parents got worried and drove me to the local health centre. (And this time, by local I mean a 10 minute drive)  The doctor there told me that it's probably pulled muscles, and that it would get better in a week or two, but advised that I get an X-ray just in case.  For that, we had to go to yet another health centre because no radiographers were present.  Fuck my life.\n\nSo we got to the 2nd health centre after a further 15 minute drive.  The X-ray was done and it was concluded that I have a radial head fracture (type 1), which basically means that a part of my elbow bone broke but was still in place, meaning that it would get better if my arm is plastered for 6 weeks.  But, of course, no orthopaedic specialist was there so I was sent to a hospital (a further 15 minute drive) and got it plastered there.\n\nSo basically playing football led to me fracturing my elbow and getting my dominant arm plastered for 6 weeks.

We talked for *hours* and I can't recall a time (at least recently) that I had such a great, in-depth conversation--not even with my boyfriend. I hate to say it but I couldn't help feeling attracted to him.  \n\nI left before anything could happen, but now I'm feeling very conflicted. I've never experienced feeling instantaneously comfortable/connecting with anyone like this (even my current BF has told me that I was really quiet / shy when we first met and it took me a while to warm up to him). To be honest, I'm curious to pursue this, but logically I know that would be wrong. If I really wanted to see if there was anything there with this guy, I know I would have to break up with my boyfriend. But it feels stupid to let go of a long-term relationship just because I feel like I maybe might be better off with someone else. On the other hand, I'm also wondering if the relationship maybe wasn't as strong as I thought it was, if I'm questioning what it would be like to be with someone else other than my BF... I feel like if you truly loved someone, you wouldn't be having those doubts--especially after two years.\nTL;DR:"}

Emoji use is heavy, good night texts often too.\nWe've been going out the past couple weeks, I believe four times thus far and we have plans again for this week.

We never talked about the prospect of dating, but I'm fairly certain she likes me too.  The way we can effortlessly hold conversation, the way she laughs at my sarcasm and jokes, the way she looks and smiles at me.  You know those \"I want someone to look at me the way X looks at Y\" memes?  That's kinda how she looks at me, even when we get caught staring at each other.  There's times where we're able to finish each others' sentences too.  There's more to say, but I think you get the picture. \n\nIs there a point where we're dating, bf/gf without directly acknowledging it?  Right now it appears that way in every way but officially.  I don't want to seem like that creepy guy that sees something out of nothing, because there's definitely something there.\n\nI understand the one surefire way to know is to ask, but I know that runs the risk of making the friendship we have more...awkward?

This is also a throwaway because it's something I'd rather he (boyfriend [26M] not find out about, since he knows my actual reddit username.\n\nHere's some light background information: We don't live together, but both of us want to. We have a great and healthy relationship. He graduated college 2 years ago and I'm still in school and working full time.\n\nSo here's my issue...\n\nHe can't find a job. He's pretty much been an intern since before graduation (he's fantastic at getting internships), and at all of these internships, his superiors offer letters of recommendation, keep an eye out for job openings/opportunities, etc. But none of them have hired him. He applies to jobs every single day, but nothing has ever come of the interviews he gets.\n\nI was always the one who would say \"Hold out, something better must be coming,\" or \"Don't worry, there are plenty of other firms around here.\" Once all of the in-state options were exhausted, it turned into \"Can you look out of state? There is WAY more opportunity in (fill in the city).\" After the umpteenth no-call-back though, I've lost most of my optimism. \n\nWe're both ready to start our lives together, but that isn't going to happen unless he feels that he can support us. I used to get so excited at the thought of him going to interviews or getting some other opportunity to put a foot in the door somewhere, but now, when he tells me about these new things that are coming along, all I feel is exhaustion. \n\nI'm just really struggling with being the support he needs through this while not spiraling down, myself. I don't know if I'm looking for advice, or just to vent, but I needed to get it out somewhere.\nTL;DR:"}

Finally I absolutely needed to sleep or I would not be able to do anything at all.\nThat is when things got really weird.  I laid down to try and sleep and I started hear voices in my head (atleast I think they were voices, it sounded more like glaciers on a mountain cracking  and shifting), so this deep rumbling voice in my head is telling me how terrible things are and how angry I should be and how I should hate everything.  The walls in my room started turning a pulsing red and and seemed to shift in color as the voices talked.  It scared the shit out of me or it would have had I had any to expel.  Well after an hour of what was probably hell.  I got up and pushed for another long day.  When I went to finally get a full nights rest I didn't have anymore of this happen.\n\nSo now my question is for you.  What have you had happen that is crazy when you were severely sleep deprived?

I think it's from inactivity and drinking beer.  He doesn't try to make himself presentable to me any more.  I'm not a shallow person.  I still find him attractive at any weight, but it's hard to get past him being slovenly with how he carries himself.  He doesn't care about how he dresses and often wears clothing with holes in it, even though he has plenty of clothes that are fine.  He only shaves his gross neckbeard and dresses up for work.  It makes me feel like he doesn't care how I see him.  I think the weight gain is affecting his mental state, by both fatiguing him and lowering his drive.  I don't know how to bring this up nicely.\n\nWe have sex once a week, due to me basically throwing myself on him.  He never initiates sex.  He seems to enjoy it while we are doing it, but doesn't show any desire for it at all, unless I pounce on him.\n\nHe constantly checks out other girls, makes note that they are hot, etc.  Does not compliment me or show me the same kind of attention, doesn't put any thought into doing special things for me.  I cook dinner for him a lot, and he never does unless someone comes over.  When a female friend told him he gained a noticeable amount of weight, he took her concern seriously and was considering exercise.  However, since she's not around a lot, he has fallen back into not caring.\n\nI have had many discussions with him about this.  It always ends the same.  He is getting irritated with my unhappiness.  He says he is happy and doesn't know how to make me happy.  When I bring up points like 1) **initiating sex more** 2) **be more thoughtful** , he just says he already does those things.  He claims his sex drive is high and that he is thoughtful already.  Basically, denies any fault.  He says he's fine and happy with me, and has no problems.\nTL;DR:"}

Since then I have been turned down twice by two girls (both 15F) whom I have felt a similar feeling with. Now I just don't feel a similar long-term love anymore and I constantly have on-off crushes on 3 girls (15F, 16F and 16F). Take note that I have never had a serious relationship with any of the above, and thus I want to find a distinction between a crush and something that can sustain a relationship, on the assumption that if I knew this, I could know whether I should make a move or not.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [M/18] My girlfriend [F/18] brought up the idea of an open relationship.\nPOST: There aren't really any mitigating factors. We're both in our first year of college (at different schools), and things have been harder than they were at home, obviously, but I wouldn't say our relationship has gone to shit. At this point, we've been together for a year and 10 months and have each had hookups in the past but only had sex with each other.\n\nLike the title says, she brought up to me an open relationship. I reacted ambivalently; I wouldn't have brought it up myself, but now that she did, it sounds like something to try. She suggests that hook-ups would, in general, be fair game, but that we would not have sex except with each other and that we would tell the other when we hooked up.\n\nPersonally, it seems to me that this would be fine. We don't see each other all the time, so it would certainly be sexually satisfying, but I wanted to ask someone who had experienced something like this what pros/cons, general guidelines, or advice you might have. I know it'll be different for every couple, but I just wondered generally what everyone thought.\n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

I am 20(f) and I live with my boyfriend 23(m) but he is soon to be 24! we have been dating for about 2 years.\n\nThe reason i am posting on here is I am seeking advice on how to celebrate his birthday-mainly on if I should force him to go to a birthday party. To explain, his older brother's birthday is around the same time and his wife is going to have a birthday party for him, but she also wants to make it a combined birthday for my boyfriend. I told my boyfriend how it might be fun and he could invite his buddies from work, but he doesn't seem down for the whole idea, because.. well I don't know why for sure, he is just a homebody.\n\nMy boyfriend is the type of guy who enjoys staying home, playing video games, and doesn't go out much. I don't want to force him and make him mad, but I feel like he would have a good time once he got there and was drinking with his work buddies. I know he would have fun, because we went to someones party once and he was really anxious at first and once we got there he was having the best time drinking and talking sports with his friends. \n\nmy question is: how do I convince him this birthday is a good idea? I don't know if I should talk him into it, tell him to do it for me or what. Also, I know for a fact he won't tell anybody at work so I don't know if it would be bad of me to invite one or two people from work that I know he talks to. I just think he is too anti social sometimes and needs to let loose. I would also have fun at this party, but if he is really against it I won't go.\n\nI wanted to mention that the reason i am asking is my boyfriend isn't one to go into why he feels a certain way or why he doesn't want to go somewhere and I don't know what my \"game plan\" should be. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :) I love my boyfriend and only want him to have fun!\nTL;DR:"}

This included his mum, dad, himself, his friend, his brother and his wife and his other brother and his relatively new girlfriend. I unfortunately couldn't go as I had a unit at uni I needed to complete in order to graduate, also $$$. \nObviously first up, seeing all the photos of them together popping up literally from each and every one of them was upsetting, but nothing I can do. The photos of all the boys and their partners was probably the worst, along with his mums caption - \"I love my kids\" or some shit. \nAnyway, after the first few weeks of them all being together, they all went their separate ways. My boyfriend is currently still in Europe travelling around, and everyone else is back home. \n\nWe've been dating for over 4 years now, and I'm at his house nearly every day (he still lives with his parents) so I'm very close with them. Today was his mums birthday, and I assumed if anything was happening, I'd be told. \nI went on Facebook to see a whole album of pictures of a huge dinner, cake, wine, presents, all happening at their house with my bfs brother and wife present, and the new girlfriend (without brother bf who works away) \n\nAm I right to be upset about this? I mentioned it to my bf, trying to not sound too snide, and he said it's probably because he's not there - but that's exactly my point. Why does he have to be present for me to be invited? Why was this new girl invited? I'm feeling really upset because I love his family, and I make a huge effort with them and anything they're going through.\nTL;DR:"}

She was a little offended but she let it go.\n\nIt came up again last week, but I didn't give a firm no. I just decided we should talk about it more. Then I asked my best friend [25 F] what I should do, and she encouraged me to give the girl a chance because my only reservation was the age thing.\n\nSo we talked about it for a long time. We're in different places in life, but we're not incompatible, and I'm convinced that her head is in the right place. I ended up kissing her goodnight.\n\nI still have mixed feelings about it.

I think I'm just here looking for advice from people who have tried something like this before.\nTL;DR:"}

The problem is that every time I bring it up he says he wants to work it out. Then he will just go on like I never brought up the subject. He's trying really hard and I feel guilty, but I just don't want to work it out. The divorce is inevitable at this point. \n\nWhat I do want to do is plan for the divorce. I'm sole financial provider for my family, while he stays home with our children. I work crazy hours, so it would be difficult for me to find childcare that would be in my budget and he is wonderful as a stay at home dad. We need to work out finances (how will he support himself) and plan for custody (who will have primary, visitations, etc.). He's not a bad guy. He's a great guy.  I'm really the one that's a scumbag. \n\nRegardless, I can't stay with him. How do I get him to understand and accept so that we can come up with a plan? I don't want it to come down to me just changing bank accounts and moving out, leaving him with no way to support himself. Also, I need his help parenting. I can't do it on my own nor would he just give up custody (I'm not asking him to, but I certainly don't want to just abandon my children either). I think he knows I won't just leave and is using this to keep me trapped in a marriage I can't stay in. What can I do? Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I just discovered that there is a subreddit called \"jalbait\" that encourages people to post pictures of prepubescent girls.  Why is this accepted in the Reddit community?\nPOST: As a new Redditor (and first-time poster), I have thus far enjoyed the stories, links, creation and propagation of interesting memes and the collective hivemind mentality of Reddit.  People seem to be genuinely interested in each other in both success and plight.  Redditors can at once celebrate and share their fortunes and raise awareness to presing issues around the world.  It is rare to find a site that encapsulates so many of the positive aspects of humanity.\n\nBut this subreddit, while seemingly innocuous (I imagine there is no nudity, so it cannot be considered pornography), is an abhorrent exploitation of young people at a very vulnerable stage in their development.  I am a 30-year-old man, so I cannot relate directly to these girls, but I certainly understand the precarious and often troubling aspects of puberty.  At this age, children and teens are attempting to discover their sexuality and their bodies while making the transition from the innocence of childhood to the ever-increasing demands of adolescence.\n\nA young person might post his or her picture on a site like Facebook for their friends to see, perhaps to remember a fun event or to display new clothes, etc.  My wife works with lots of young kids who often post their (sports) competition pictures to Facebook, with their parents' consent.  Stealing these pictures for masturbatory purposes is, in every single interpretation of the concept, unethical.  It is also very unrealistic to assume that the subjects in these pictures pose with the intention to arouse, given that the majority of them have yet to understand sexuality (see above).  To think about masturbating to these pictures as anything other than molestation is gravely misguided.\n\nChildren are already hypersexualized by nearly every form of media both in visual display and in essence\u2014sexuality is sensationalized without any caveat regarding healthy development or sexual awareness.  Why does a genuinely well-meaning site like Reddit promote paedophilia?  Is it really in line with free thought?\nTL;DR:"}

We texted and snapped daily, then we decided to meet and go to church and lunch together last Sunday, with his brother as a chaperone of course. We talked awhile more and made plans for early this week but since about Friday, the conversation has pretty much stopped for a day or two.\n\nI'm one of those people that's usually getting snaps all the time, and in a bunch of group conversations and such; AKA I know what my friends and family are doing 90% of the time. I think it's just become a habit to keep in contact with the people close to me pretty much all the time. \n\nI'm sure it's probably normal to not talk for a day or two this early on, but it's just weird to me because in my world, if someone doesn't talk for a day, or doesn't reply to your last text, it's sending the signal that they don't like you and if you try to contact them more you're just being annoying. It's probably the wrong way to go about that, but that's just how we approached things in high school and university. \n\nI sent him a text this Sunday (Mothers Day) morning and he never replied. I just left it because I don't want to seem clingy or anything. When do I text him next; in a few days, a week? He's a generally quieter guy and honestly, I've never had a guy not text for two days, so I don't know how to approach this. The only reason as to why he wouldn't talk to me, in my mind at least, is that he doesn't like me.\nTL;DR:"}

We started texting a bit and hanging out in groups with mutual friends. Well she started texting me about some boy problems (obvious friendzone move) but that was early on. I never talked bad about him. But about a month ago she stopped talking about him and we started to hang out together a lot, just the two of us. In the last couple weeks I have really started to like her and I kind of think she feels the same. She usually goes to bed early but she has been spending late nights fishing and sailing with me. And if our group of friends was going out to do something but I didn't go she would opt to do whatever I was doing. So I feel like those are positive signs. That leads us to the love letter. She flew out of the country today for a fishing trip with her family for 10 days. So last night I hand wrote her a love letter, not real mushy, but basically telling her how much fun I have had getting to know her, explaining why I like her, and stating that I would like to pursue the relationship further when she returns. I gave it to her this morning when I dropped her off at the airport and told her to read it on the plane. So now I guess we will see what happens in 10 days.

Just when I thought I could trust someone, it completely broke again.\n\nI don't know what to do, or how to overcome this fear of trust anymore.

Also, I am 18 and a senior in high school. So today for our school auction we, students, always help out by moving stuff and doing whatever. No problem, been school tradition. However, last year the school board majorly screwed up and most of (except 1) the teachers left because the board was extremely unethical (that's all back story, I agreed with nothing the board did, but going into senior year had no real option to transfer). Anyway, the school hired new teachers and hired new personnel. This new personell has barely any idea what they are doing. Moving up to today, it has been jokingly nicknamed forced labor Friday. Except, today was no joke. The teachers were given sticks for threatening purposes. They herded us along like cattle, and would swing them to hurry us up. When my friends and I weren't moving fast enough our diplomas were threatened (I have no background of trouble, 3.9 gpa, good student, so being a trouble maker isn't a problem). Eventually a kid did get hit in the head with a stick, and the threatening continued. I do have picture evidence for the report, and would be able to upload if anyone wants to. Not the best pictures, because I would rather not get caught with my phone...\nTL;DR:"}

He is a great person and everything I want in a partner, so really nothing that I have issue with is actually his fault, but I can't stop being bothered about his past and comparing myself to his exes.\n\nBefore he was with me, he was engaged to another girl, and they went through a long romance. As in the sort of romance you hear about in the books, right down to proposing on top of the Eiffel Tower. Of course, they aren't together anymore, and the relationship went horrible so here we are today, but I am having a really hard time getting over that part of him.\n\nIn a way I think it is because I have never had that sort of past. Though I have had long relationships they have not been that good, and I was already battling with the fact that he's been engaged before and so it wouldn't be as special if we were to ever get engaged. Now knowing how he did it it's made it even worse because how could anything we do ever compare with that? It's like my mind doesn't mind about the fact that it went bad, even though it was negative for years, it just hears the rest of it and makes me feel bad. It was never his intention to make me feel bad and he tried his hardest to make me see that it didn't matter, but it's playing on my mind quite a lot and I can't stop thinking about it to the extent that it's affecting my thoughts towards our relationship.\n\nI feel pathetic even complaining about this, but how can I get around thinking about this in this way?!\nTL;DR:"}

We both live in Finland right now, studying at high school in an international program. She is on her senior year (she skipped one year in elementary) and I'm on my second year. She's graduating next spring.\n\nWhile she is applying to a chemistry department here in Helsinki, her main interests regarding Universities are in Scotland, art and design studies which she cannot do in Finland. I am **not** trying to force her to stay here. She loves to study art, and I want her to do what she loves to do. But I love her too much to let our relationship deteriorate after she moves. \n\nI miss her even after a weekend apart. I can from time to time be a bit jealous, or at my worse even paranoid, without reason. Though I do trust her immensely when I'm not being crazy. She's not a very jealous person, and while she does miss me some times, mostly it'll take more than five days for her to miss me. She pretty obviously gets a confidence boost from guys giving her attention, and that doesn't really bother me now, but it can be a problem in the future. I believe that she could handle the long distance relationship a lot better than me in general, since I'm the one who needs more intimacy (not meaning just the sex.)\n\nSo my question is; how would I keep our relationship as good as it is, or at least keep it from falling apart? How can I make her feel loved, and myself to not be jealous or paranoid? \n\nThank you in advance!\nTL;DR:"}

We did kind of talk about *taking a break* rather than being a long-dist relationship.\n\nI got pretty crazy after she left and led to a very hurtful blog. I said she was always being cheated on with another girl I had and I described situations. \n\nI had some indiscretions that would be cheating in her books, but she never knew about them and the girls didn't matter at all. Then, after breakup, I went into rebound of full-on double dating. I wish I could take it all back just to get her back.\n\nShe got into a relationship soon after and is happy with him since like 16 months. I have been in and out of a few relationships since then. We don't talk- after the blog and later, an incident of another girl telling her that I cheated her.\n\nI just think about her when I am alone. I want it to stop. Or, should I pursue this *love*.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, am I a loser?\nPOST: Hey Reddit, \n\nAlthough this is only my third or fourth post, I have been a lurker, reading TONS of Iamas and askReddits, for a long time now.\n\nToday I come to you guys to get some advice and hopefully hear some testimonies from fellow \"laid back\" people like me. \n\nEver since about 2nd grade I've hated school... Not because of any bad experiences, I was the class clown, but because I have always done what I've wanted to do and the very minimum of what anyone else wanted me to do. Hence, my grades have always been C's. Flash forward to now, a junior in High school, the C's have not ended. I currently have a 3.0 out of 5.0 GPA and am starting to get more and more nervous as I see a lot of my fellow students getting accepted into and going off to college. I am very interested in web development and think I want to pursue a career in that, but am scared my lack of good grades will either stop or put me in terrible debt getting there.\n\nAlthough I have never done good in school, I am a dreamer and want to live life to the fullest (who doesn't). I come from a family with a father who works a dead end job and has to worry about if he will lose his house everyday, and a mom who is in her second divorce and jobless. I want so bad to be able to help them out, but have done nothing but sat around picking my ass all of my life. I currently am working two part-time jobs and am what you could consider a good kid (by good I mean I sit around trying to make websites while watching cops in my free time. Thus not going to parties or getting into \"trouble\"/have no friends). \n\nHopefully you guys can understand somewhat of my life and how I want to be successful, but am stuck in a world where a system of letters determine how smart you are and whether you have a chance at success or end up a lonely loser.\nTL;DR:"}

I did land one short term contract for a startup but responses past that have been lukewarm. I graduated as an Electrical Engineer, yet took a software consulting position after graduation a year and a half ago. I was under the impression that it wouldn't be difficult to land an engineering position but finding it quite the opposite as I'm receiving very few call backs on engineering jobs, due to my job history appearing as though I'm attempting a career change, which I suppose I am.. \n\nSo recently I started simply applying for technician positions, of which I'm over-qualified for the majority, however, many of the hiring managers in initial conversations notice my BSEE and are hesitant to hire someone that just wants to use the technician position as a stepping stone towards engineering. I give them the canned response that \"I'm young enough that I plan to progress and grow with the company, whether that's in this position or another\", and that seems satisfy many of them.\n\nShould I simply apply for technician positions that will hopefully give me the required experience necessary to get my foot in the door to some good engineering opportunities? \n\nWhat about when I find a company that has the engineering job I want (and am qualified for), but also a technician position that I'd likely accept (but am overqualified for).. Is it wise to simply apply for the better position and add a sidenote that I'd be interested to hear back on the technician position as well?\nTL;DR:"}

She wants me to move in with her for a couple weeks at a time while she's living at school I'm working full-time. Marriage is also a popular conversation topic, and for her it isn't an \"if\" but a \"when\" when we discuss it.\n\nThe thing is, the past year or so we've started to notice that we aren't really similar at all, but she thinks its a good thing because \"opposites attract\". I don't really buy that. Basically, as time has wore on, especially recently, I have become really distant. I don't go out of my way to call or text her, and I haven't really been excited to see her lately either. I've been considering ending it, but I feel like it would be incredibly unfair to her.\n\nShe is one of the nicest people I have ever been around. She always does little surprises for me, or takes interests in my interests cause she knows I like that. My family loves her and she loves them. And if I were to break up with her it would really come out of nowhere. To my friends, family, and of course her.\n\nThe worst part is I've started to hit it off with a female friend I went to school with who I think I have much more compatibility with. It just sucks cause I know I'm a complete asshole for thinking/acting the way I have considering how good my girlfriend has been to me over the years, but I can't help but think that she isn't the one, and the longer I wait the harder it will be for everyone involved if we split up.\n\nAny advice from anyone that has been in a similat situation before?

The past couple years we've been away from each other on and off due to school and other activities but always kept in contact and expressed our feelings for each other. \n\nA few months ago i was accepted to the college she was going to and decided this would be a great time to be with her. She seemed so excited for me to come up for these past few months and expressed how great it would be to finally be together.\n\nWell I finally arrived at school and hung out with her for a couple days. Then she dropped it on me suddenly. She told me that she felt that we should see other people and she didnt love me like she used too. She just felt we werent very compatible and that i wasnt someone she thinks she could marry. I was so shocked and heart broken. She wanted to still be friends but thats it. We agreed to take a couple of days to think about it then talk. I cried and cried knowing the fact that i still had feelings for her but she didnt for me. \n\nI felt so alone and betrayed that she would keep telling me she loved me after so many years and just end it finally when i was with her.  I was angry and upset, which then just turned into saddness and depression. After a while i guess i finally came back to my senses.  I thought more and more about it and feel that it would probably be better if we broke up. I want her to be happy and know shes not happy with me which breaks my heart but it is what it is. So we met up yesterday and agreed to separate. I know its probably that right choice but it still hurts and kills me inside. A part of me would rather just have no contact with her but we're in a few of the same classes and hang within the same group of people. I want to be her friend but i feel that seeing her will just make me feel worse and be bitter when she starts dating others. \n\nI just needed to tell someone.

There is a $8-9000 difference between an SR5 and a limited.\n\n They claimed they couldn't access the old website and showed me a 4runner they said was mine (without all the aftermarket stuff they put on it) that said it was a SR5 ever since Nov 11.   I figured I was nuts or something so I went home, not happy at all.  I would not have paid this much if I knew it was an SR5\n\nI found a cached page that showed the listing as a limited.  The page was cached on Dec 14, 15, 19, 24...I first looked at the car on Dec 11, signed papers on Dec 23.  \n\nThe contract just says 4runner.  It has a place for \"style\" but it is blank.

Hearing about others past experiences can be awesome.\n\nSecond, we're traveling together and often have activities together so complete separation from her is not possible until the school year ends.\n\n**The situation:**\n\nThis girl diverts to herself *every* conversation/topic, without fail.  We (the rest of our group) have actually counted and she re-directed the conversation to herself roughly 17 times in the space of an hour-long, on and off conversation while we were going from point A to point B.  It's a major turn off, as a lot of what she adds is barely relevant to the conversation, and is usually a conversation killer (a combination of irrelevance and everyone is sick of her starting everything with \"I\").  It's so bad that other students who aren't a part of our program, but were traveling with us for a specific trip, couldn't stand being with her after 48 hours. \n\nNow, to some degree I feel bad for her, because the intentional separation is blatant sometimes.  But at the same time she's very critical and makes comments (when not talking about herself) that are really unnecessary and sometimes borderline rude.  So somewhat socially awkward and inept but still rude. \n\nWe have tried the tactics of continuing on with the conversation as normal or outright saying that so-and-so was talking about something when she interjects, but she just doesn't seem to get the hint.  Silence on our part, after a conversation killer, is just met with more talking about herself in response.  This leaves, if we should do anything at all, someone telling her that there's an issue that she isn't aware of.\n\nSo, users of reddit, should someone talk to her in private about the problem or just continue the separation and hope for the best until the end of the trip?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [26/f] want to ask out Stephen [27/m], but it might be taboo? I don't know how to approach him - or if I should.\nPOST: Hi everybody. \n\nI am in graduate school in the northeast US in a program that is highly specialized, prestigious, and competitive. Each year's class is about 10 students who move through the program together. We become quite close and, although it's competitive, we really rely on each other's support to get through it successfully. There is no rule about not dating within your class, and the school and teachers could not care less, but there's kind of an unspoken rule within the culture of the program that you don't date someone in your class. Kind of a \"don't sh*t where you eat\" thing. That being said, it happens -- but I guess often when it ends, it doesn't end well. \n\nI've started to realize over the past month or two that I am really starting to fall for my classmate Stephen. We've gotten along since day one of the program and I have never felt that competitiveness with him -- just genuine support for one another. He's really someone I could see myself spending my life with - and that both scares and excites me. I honestly have no clue if he sees me that way too or not. Because of the nature of our program, I think people just assume that any romantic interest that you could interpret just isn't actually there, so you're never really looking out for that... if that makes any sense? I really don't know how to tell him how I feel, or find out how he feels, without causing some weird scene that everyone in the program finds out about. \n\nAdmittedly too, and I think this is important: most of us spend so much time pouring ourselves into our studies and into this program, that dating in general takes a backseat. For me personally, I can honestly say that even if Stephen wasn't in this program with me, I would have trouble showing that I am interested without feeling like a goofball totally forcing it... and have trouble catching the signs back. \n\nAdvice?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not physically addicted (psychologically, maybe?) but I have become uncomfortable with being sober.\n\nI first started using drugs when I was 15 years old, and my drug of choice was marijuana. It was brought onto me by my older brother, and at the time I was suffering from depression. My depression was a result of sexual abuse as a child as well as witnessing physical abuse between family. At the time, I was in a rough spot. I was very depressed and I couldn't seem to get relief, but when I tried marijuana, it did help mask it. \n\nFirst, I started to smoke once in awhile but it soon grew out of control, I started to smoke weed a lot. Three times a day, for months. I was smoking up to 3 grams a day, and it was all free so my self control was thrown out the window. I got caught by school under the influence, had to attend a program. I went through depression again, and as soon as I got out of the program. I picked up smoking again, just as much.\n\nI ended up moving to a different state and my smoking has gradually decreased, but I started to use LSD. LSD worked really well at helping me out but it also got out of hand. I wasn't tripping daily but I tripped very frequently.\n\nAs of now, I'm sober, but I have tripped LSD recently and still smoke. I always get this uncomfortable feeling with sobriety, as if life is not enjoyable without drugs. I hope somebody could help me get on track.\n\nI try to meditate and work out, but as of late I am still depressed. My depression is far better than it was 2 years ago, but it is still there.\nTL;DR:"}

What can I do?\nPOST: Okay so I don't know what's relevant so here's the long story in all its frustrating glory.\n\nI'm Canadian and I got a job working for an American organization but in Canada. Everything leading up to the job was fine but when I started on May 17 of this year, everything started going wrong. The first was that I actually wasn't officially hired since someone in the hiring department didn't get me the right paperwork. It took two weeks to sort that out. After that, I filled out my two-week timesheets for the whole summer (it's the same pay every pay period and not based on hours worked) and sent them in the beginning of June.\n\nI filled out the online direct deposit form and it seemed to go through. However, after I didn't get paid when I was supposed to, I called Payroll. They told me that it was impossible to do direct deposit to a Canadian bank and they would issue me a paper cheque to my home address. (First red flag was that they hired me knowing I was Canadian and didn't bring up this problem before). I was working out-of-province but I had enough money to last me the summer and expected that my pay cheques would be waiting for me when I got home July 25. Lo and behold, no money!\n\nOn July 26 I received an email from the department I worked for telling me that they had my cheque and where they should send it. This was WEEKS after the cheque was supposed to be sent out. The cheque was sent out July 27 and as of today, still hasn't arrived. I figured they would express it to me since they have screwed up at every point and I have not received any compensation for almost 3 whole months.\n\nThe rotten cherry on this whole cake is that even after I receive the cheque, there is a 30 day hold on all international cheques. So I won't have the full amount available to me for another month. I am beyond frustrated but I don't know if I have any legal recourse here. I have considered contacting the US Department of Labor.

We're in college. So maybe that was the first fuck up. \n\nSo what this meant was, that there are cameras on the premises in public areas, (back deck, stairwells etc). We paid $300 for the security deposit which in my mind I expected to get back because we did not cause any severe damage other than normal wear and tear. \n\nNew Jersey state law says that a landlord has 30 business days to send a **itemized list of deductions** or the money, and if they don't we are awarded the up to double the original investment. \n\nText messages back and forth led to me asking the landlord for the itemized list. She said that we would get $100 of the original $300 because she had to pay a cleaning crew to clean up.  She refused to send it so I called her. \n\n**The Fuck Up**: I called the landlord and politely explained to her that I needed a itemized list before I would talk to her about damages or take any money she wanted to send. This led to her and her husband verbally getting upset with me on the phone to the point of screaming and then she said \"Now you're not getting shit back\" and hanging up on me.\nTL;DR:"}

(X-post from askreddit)\nPOST: I have been married for about 3 years, and in my mind everything has been going great, but recently a few things have been on my mind. About a month ago I got on the computer as per my usual routine, and my wife left the browser open in a group where she and her friends talk about relationships. The last post she had written basically said that she was thinking of leaving me because of a mood disorder I have(I hadn't been able to get my medication). Fast forward a few weeks and her mom was visiting. I'm still not sure how it came up, but her mother let it slip that my wife was trying to get pregnant, and had not so much as asked me. During all of this, she planned a trip to Vegas, and I tried to get the time off from work. She stayed at her friends parents house, and told me that her friends parents didn't want me to stay overnight (which I would find much more believable if we weren't married).  On top of that, when the day for her to leave came, we found out we were low on money. I asked her not to go because the tires on our car were in no shape for a road trip, and I didn't want her to run out of gas. Despite my asking her to wait a week or two until we could get those things taken care of, she left anyways. And the last detail, yesterday she went to her doctors to get a blood test done to find out if she is pregnant, but the thing is, her period isn't supposed to start for another few days. All of this has been driving me insane, especially the baby thing, we have talked about having kids before, and we agreed not to have them until after I've finished school, and can support a family. I honestly still love her and don't want to lose her, but I feel betrayed. I have talked with my friends about this, but really want to hear what strangers think...\nTL;DR:"}

She told me their entire story and said she no longer has feelings for him and they both have moved on.  Originally I didn't really care, I just didn't want to meet the guy.  She texts with him once in a while and also hangs out with him though rarely assuming she's telling me every time they do.\n\nHer and I are together almost daily.  We're talking about moving in together.  She seems really committed to the relationship.  I surprised her on my lunch break by bringing lunch to her a couple weeks ago when she was sick and later that night she gave me a card saying how much she loves and appreciates me.  But I can't help but feeling uncomfortable about the fact that she still talks to her ex.  This has never happened to me before, and I feel shitty about even feeling like this, because I think it'd be manipulative to tell her she can't talk to him or something.  I don't know how to bring it up without sounding like I don't trust her; I don't know if I should even bring it up.\n\nShe leaves her phone around all the time; I know the password and could easily snoop on their texts and her FB messages, but feel like that'd be a shitty thing to do and am ashamed for even having the urge to do so.  I just feel really weird about this situation, but then feel bad for feeling like I can't trust her, then feel like an idiot because if she had something to hide she wouldn't be leaving her phone sitting around, but then have this urge to look to make sure they're not flirting or something.  Ugh.\nTL;DR:"}

Reddit, can we stand up for the little guy against these behemoth companies?\nPOST: So my boss signs me up for a 12-month gym membership with Extreme Fitness which I reluctantly pay for and then try to cancel on the twelfth month. I talk to \"Joel\" at one of their locations and he says \"No problem, you need to notify Kirk at this location and let him know you want to cancel. Here's his info.\" So after several attempts to call Kirk, I leave a voicemail clearly stating that 12 months were up and I did not wish to continue with the gym, and to stop taking monthly payments from my account, this is my number, thank you and good day. Of course, because gyms rely on conning people to stay alive, money is still taken from my account so I close the account to protect my money. Now they have collections after me claiming I owe them over $500 in unpaid fees and that my membership was never cancelled.\n\nThey want me to go in and sign a termination contract to officially end it, which makes sense, but 'Joel' didn't inform me of this at the time. If I sign and date their contract, then I'll be signing off on this date of termination and legally owe them the money. I'm a young, single father with low-income and no financial support, just trying to keep it together. I'm just a server in a bistro, for goodness sake, I can't afford this.\n\nUltimately, I'm not here for sympathy, but I'm pissed off about something. This isn't the first time this has happened to me with a gym, and I feel like they con people into always paying more than they're letting on. Every company seems to have it's tricks. Well, what about the little guy? Can't we come together and just refuse to pay them for nothing, to pay them simply because we were *told* we owe them this much for this and that much for that?

When I was about 12, me and my friends were riding our bikes in a not-so-great neighborhood. We found this weird, concrete block that was about 10 by 10 feet, with a wall on one side about 5 by 5 feet, hidden on the side of a hill, so it was invisible from the road. Under the big concrete block was a small hole, and we saw something shining in it, buried under a pile of bricks. We pulled out this big plastic box, nailed shut, with a paper sign on it that had been washed away by rain. Being the naive twelve year olds that we were, we immediately assumed it was a ton of drugs or a large sum of stolen money. Curious folks that we were, we managed to carry it all the way back to my house. We got a hammer, opened it up, and peeked inside. Rather than stolen loot or illegal narcotics, we found about 500 McDonald's happy meal toys. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed.\nTL;DR:"}

This place is the type that does not allow you in without ID and a reason to be there. So I tell the cab driver he needs to drop me off in the front of the place at the taxi stand and to NOT approach the gate. I am half asleep cause it is 5 am. I am not paying total attention and look up, as we get to the base. He pulls in towards the gate. Now, one way to really tick off a guard, is to try to do a turn around ahead of the gate. It looks suspicious, they will not take it well, and will likely pursue you and be exceptionally unhappy with you. So we are now committed to driving to the gate to tell the guard my driver is a dumb ass. We get there, we have 4 visible guards, all of them armed with M4s. They signal for him to stop as we get to the gate. I am realizing now, he is sweating bullets and has a totally freaked out look on his face. He hits the gas instead of the brake, the engine revs, the car vaults forward, he hits the brake and stops 3 feet from the closest guard. I am screaming at him at this point to stop the F'ing car, and calling him every name I can muster. I realize all of a sudden that the guards (who are now ALL pointing their rifles at us), are also screaming at us. They yank us both out of the car, and over the next 20-30 minutes (felt like 3 hours) we are having a pleasant chat with them and their supervisor, before they clear us. They send him on his way and I get to go to work and explain to my boss why security called him about me. These guards don't mess around. It was very fortunate we did not get shot at.

I'm still undecided because I've never purchased a used game. And the last time I lent someone a game, I had to borrow it back 3 months later. So I don't do that anymore. But here is my logic::  I'm also a PC gamer. And the rule of a PC game/program/MMO is the same as Xbox One, you cannot share licenses or titles. I play World of Warcraft and when we get banned, we lose our privileges. We cannot share accounts. When I bought Photoshop, it clearly states that we cannot share licenses. Plus, just like the Xbox One, I can go to another computer and use my Photoshop license there fully. As long as my other computer isn't using it. These rules that Microsoft implemented on the Xbox One is NOTHING new. Why is everyone so surprised? And about it being ALWAYS ON, well our cell phones are ALWAYS ON. We cant make a phone call if its not always on. Cant send a text or a picture message if its not connected to a network. Sure you can use the internet via WiFi but the primary function for a TELEPHONE is to make phone calls. And you MUST always be on for you to do so. I have a vision for consoles, and it is that we move away from disc based gaming and move to a complete digital distribution. Basically make consoles what computers are today. The only reason i'd say no to an Xbox One is because of the no OFFLINE mode game play. Sometimes ISP's do go down. And thats the only thing im worried about. \n\nBut my question is, are we holding ourselves back, technologically speaking, by siding with Sony on the \"console war\"?\nTL;DR:"}

It's been a semi stressful experience for me because while I've really grown to care about him he's sent a lot of mixed signals and will shit from being crazy about me to making me feel rather expendable. \n\nHe had expressed to me that he didn't want a relationship, for personal reasons that while he didn't go to deep into seemed to really upset him, and not because of me. While this seems like a total line I chose to belief him and told him I wanted to keep going with our friendship the way we had been (texting daily, spending the weekends one on one, being physical, etc.) and that I didn't expect anything from him that he couldn't give me. \n\nFor now, this has worked well and it does feel like it means a lot more ... but it's also caused some problems, like me not feeling like I can express being upset about his friendship with his ex. \n\nWell, this past weekend we went out of town and curiosity got the best of me (this was really really shitty of me and I'm 100% aware of that) and I looked at what meds he took. Turns out he's on antidepressants... which really explains everything. It explains his moods, his lack of strong romantic emotion... it's such a simple answer that really just makes everything so much more complex. I've struggled with depression in the past so I have a personal understanding to some degree. But, he's not been open with me about it very directly and I don't know what to do now.\n\nI don't know how to approach our \"non-relationship\" relationship now. I want to be there for him, really it just makes me care about him more. But I also don't want him to never feel like he can open up to me. I honestly don't even know what questions to ask at this point, I'm just confused and trying to process everything and looking for any kind of advice.\nTL;DR:"}

In March I resigned from a Warehouse Supervisor job I held for a year. The reason I resigned was because of the result of a random drug test I took. I take adderall recreationally sometimes, and its usually out of my system completely within 24 hours. My luck, I got a call from people not part of the company asking me if i was prescribed it and that my results came back positive. So, knowing I would be fired the next day, I showed up early and quickly wrote a resignation letter and effectively quit.  \n\nNow, I've been working at my father's liquor store since then. It's not cutting it financially. \n\nMy question is: on future applications, how do you recommend I answer the question of why I am no longer employed by that company. I want to turn this negative into a positive here. I gained valuable skills there, and have good relations with my former bosses, but I can't write \"I resigned pending termination resulting from a random drug screening.\" I need advice on how to approach this both on paper and verbally if it were to come up in an interview.\nTL;DR:"}

I spoke with her and confessed my weakness and she agreed to pull back. \n\nIt took me letting my wife wander into the arms of another man for me to realize that I burned for her.  I told her how I felt. \n\nShe revealed to me that she would back off this other guy but was not happy about it. I had, over the first four years of our marriage, let her desire for me go unsatisfied  by wasting my energy on fantasies and pornography. Moreover she does not feel comfortable with me in bed becuase I have cracked jokes about her performance and harshly critiqued her body at times. I made her feel undesirable and stolen her confidence. I realize I have only myself to blame.\n\nNow I want to do what I always should have done. I want to be all that I can be for her.

All I know is I feel like I wanna tell her how I feel, but I really don't want to mess up our friendship.\n\nBasically, I like her a lot. I want to let her know so I can find out if she likes me the same way, because she's sent some stuff that could go either way. Is there a way to minimize the risk of losing her as a friend?

And What would make him believe she may have cancer?  Should we worry she was misdiagnosed?  What if she is still pregnant?  Are there tell-tale signs of a miscarry?  And cancer??  We are both pretty shocked at the whole thing, and I have tried not to ask too many questions of her, being emotional about it still.\n\nI guess we're both a bit relieved that her pregnancy was unknown to us, so we couldn't get attached to it.

He and his classmate found the house and asked if I was still interested, I said yes.\nThe plan was that due to the zoning bylaws in the area, there could only be a maximum of 3 unrelated people on the 2-year lease at any time, so I never actually signed the lease, though I was still considered a \"permanent\" member of the house.\n 2nd year I moved into the house, and I was told by the original guy that rent was $400/month+utilities since the total rent for the house was $1600/month. He also said that I was to pay him, since he'd already given our landlord postdated cheques.\n\nI was fine with paying that, since it's pretty cheap considering what I got for it, and I have been paying that for the last few semesters that I've lived here (now on my 3rd, though I was paying the balance when someone else was subletting my room for less). \n\nDue to a massive fuckup on my part, I'm now a year behind the original housemates, and \"off stream\" from them, so I will never be in school at the same time as them again (My university alternates between 4 months at school and then 4 months on co-op). \nLast night I was talking to one of the original housemates who is on a co-op term but still trying to find a job in the area so he can live here. He accidentally let slip something about \"375\" and when I pressed the issue, he told me that rent was only meant to be $375/month+ utilities, as the house rent was only $1500/month.\n\nMy question now is: what should I do to get back at the person who has been ripping me off /how should I approach this issue?

At first I tried to resist the temptation because I knew it wasn't the right thing to do, but as time went by I started to want to do the naughty things with her.\nShe wasn't having any of that though. She was perfectly comfortable cheating on her girlfriend by doing inappropriate things to me, yet if I were to try any inappropriate things on her she would say \"That's not OK. You know I have a girlfriend, right?\" and she would say hurtful things to me.\n\nThis went on for about 4ish years until one day she asked me to \"Give her a hand\". After which she started to show remorse for her actions started taking her relationship with her girlfriend seriously. She still did things that would constitute as cheating, but they were far less frequent, that is until last month.\n\nSometime last month she felt sorry for me and finally threw me a bone. Her and I had the sex and it was awful. She wouldn't stop making jokes and telling me how sure she is of her sexuality now. Afterwards she apologized for all the stuff she has put me through over the years and she told me that she has never felt any form of attraction for me.

A few days went by, i received some information about costing what i had to wear and what not.

[F/21] [M/22]\nPOST: For the last few weeks, my boyfriend...er, ex-boyfriend, has been using a lot of drugs (marijuana, LSD, shrooms, MDMA aka nothing \"addictive\") while I have been very depressed. I was upset that he wasn't spending time with me and his response (high out of his mind) was to break up with me because \"he loves me, but hates being around my negativity.\" Fast forward a week, he's been sober for three days (new record) and is all apologies. He can't believe how he behaved, he is sorry he hurt me, he's going to get better, etc. And yet, he doesn't want to get back together. He said that if we stayed together he would cling to me for comfort and that he wants to be independent. Now, I am madly in love with this man and up until last week was planning on spending the rest of my life with him. He told me he is still in love with me, and that maybe we can get back together when we are \"more mature.\" The thing is, I'm not going to put my life on hold waiting for him to be ready to get back with me. I can't be used like that. But I still want to spend the rest of my life with him. I want to help him get back where he wants to be. I know almost assuredly if we don't patch things up in the near future, there is no future. And I guess I'm pathetic, but I can't let go of the hope that we will reunite. Do I tell him I want to keep trying? Or am I just in denial of being dumped and need to move the fuck on?\nTL;DR:"}

Immediately after we get there I begin to get queazy. Whatever we just go float in some tubs hoping the feeling goes away. After awhile I feel better so we go to the wave pool. Sweet waves are going having a good time and that when I get less then a table spoon of water up my nose and begin to choke. So I try to back out of the pool and catch my breath. Meanwhile my boyfriend walks over pats me on the back. Which is when I start to catch my breath but then I just puke every where all over my hands dripping into the water. My SO and I booked it out of there before I get embarrassed. And now I'm sitting here laughing my ass off about it.\nTL;DR:"}

While there is no reason to be negative, as I've worked hard to provide her with anything and everything that she's ever wanted, she still finds something to pick at.\n\nToday we got into a big argument because I decided to invite my best friend of 13 years over to our house. I fed my best friend some soup. We had made enough soup for 2-3 days the day before.\n\nAfter my friend left, my wife started complaining as to why we fed my friend. There was no reason to waste any of our food on my friend. She doesn't like the fact that sometimes I invite my best friend over. She requires me to ask her permission whenever I hang out with a friend or invite one over (i hang out with a friend about once every 2 weeks). Even though she allowed for my best friend to come over and play a couple of games with me for a couple of hours on a day I got off, she was still pissed off about me wanting to hang with friends once my friend left.\n\nIt's frustrating. I don't understand why she's being negative. I've never given her a reason to not trust me, I've been loyal, and I honestly believe I've been doing my job as a husband to keep her happy.\n\nPart of me feels like my freedom has been ripped apart. I no longer have the freedom to go out and see a friend or even invite one over when she's around unless she allows of it.

She works as a cashier and one of her regulars from across the street is the guy. She said she feels like she has feelings for him and it's unfair to be with me if she feels like this. She also says it's because of my stress issues, and that I don't take care of myself. I don't have a lot of friends other than her, and those I do have are out of town for school. With that said, a lot of stress from family, school, and work ends up in me flipping out on her for small things. I feel bad instantly, but I can't control it, and I wish I knew how. As for taking care of me, it's just laziness. I could start running and eating better, as well as cleaning myself. I really love her and I want her to know that I can fix what has ruined us. Is self-improvement the best way to get her back? Also, how should I deal with her and I still being friends? Is giving her her space a good idea, or should I stay close to show I still care.

My dog quickly runs in and hides under my bed. It's too small a space for anyone to fit under there so we just have to wait until he comes out himself. Couple minutes go by and I'm just laying down in bed all of a sudden I hear a **SNAP**, the same sound as a rubber band when you play around with it followed my sounds of my dog choking. I disregard both as he quickly runs out of the room. \n\nRewind to just now I come home from work to see there is a used condom with holes in my trashcan on top of everything out in the open.

My spidey sense tingling.\nPOST: My SO of six months and I attend the same college, but we had to separate for the summer. We've been apart for almost two weeks now, and suddenly our communication has been greatly reduced. He's canceled every pre-agreed upon skype session and phone call save a single very short one. He's sent me one unprompted text, and ends the few texting conversations I've started within a message or two. \n\nThe issue I have with all of this is that I have no idea where this came from or what could be wrong. This is a guy who is normally very considerate and loving, and while we've never kept in constant contact, we usually talked at least once a day. He's told me he's not remotely busy now, and though we had a small fight the night before we left, we made up and things seemed to be mostly ok the next morning. He did seem slightly more tense than normal when said our final goodbye, but I chalked that up to the 8 hour drive he was starting. Now, I'm not so sure.\n\nIs it unreasonable for me to feel like something is odd about his behavior, or that he's probably upset or hiding something? If it's not, how do I ask him about it without sounding accusatory? We agreed before we left that we both care about each other immensely and value our relationship, so I don't want to risk ending it. \n\nThat said, I've been in a similar situation thrice before, and each time it was the strongest sign that the relationship was about to end. I don't want to believe that my current relationship is going to suffer the same fate, but I have the same gut feeling I've had each of those times before.\nTL;DR:"}

Thanks in advanced?!?!\n\n  My so and I are both 19 and we have been together for almost 3 years now. Now I'm not sure if \"Young Love\" is real or not but to be clear I love this girl. We have had our ups and downs and a few fights but what couple hasn't. We actually get along really great. She's funny, I'm funny. Usually whatever we do it involves one another laughing. I love laughing! Okay so that's clear. I love her 100%\n\n  The problem here is she lives in Canada and I live in the United States. We're about 15 hours apart from one another and I have only visited her twice. Now we typically just Skype every day and talk for hours on end. If we feel we have told each other everything we just keep each other company while we browse the web or what have you. \n\n   Okay so here is where the tale turns. About a month ago we had a pretty mutual break up. We decided with my job and her going to college we really didn't have time for one another and she couldn't bare not having my physically. Which is a big deal and I understand that.\n  Now I have been planning on moving there for awhile now. Going to college there or trying to get into the Air force. It's definitely  harder than I can tell.\n\n  She is worried that if I went to college there I'd be in serious debt. Which might be true. But I'd be going for something that I'd want to. I'd be visiting a country I love. And most importantly visiting the girl that I love.\n  So this is the deal breaker pretty much. I really want to move up there. Is it stupid of me? I really love this girl and she really loves me. The only thing I would be sacrificing is less time seeing my family (Only usually only see them on Holidays anyway). And maybe more money spent on college or university. \n\nSo please Reddit I need advice!\nTL;DR:"}

Within the last 3 weeks he has started to make more advances (touching, holding, pecks on the head) and more recently being far more passionate than that.

Unfortunately, I'm a bit of a pushover and can get easily carried away, and while a bit tipsy, we kissed, then made out. I think I fucked up big time, and hoping that I would eventually grow feelings for him, I let our physical relationship continue. But its faster than I thought. I feel like I'm leading him on since no feelings are forming. I told him I wasn't interested in dating, but not that I wasn't interested in dating him.\n\nBut I feel that the worst part of this is that one of my main reasons is that he's just not my type. It sounds so pretentious, but physically, I just do not find him attractive. I feel like we could be awesome friends, and we were before this. Ugh, I just don't know what to do anymore.

After things went south with a guy I'd been seeing, this friend was so kind to me that I began to wonder if I should've given him a chance, so I started sending subtle hints that it was okay if he wanted to ask me on a real date.  To my surprise, I saw on Facebook a few days later that he'd entered into a relationship with someone else.  No big deal.  We were casual acquaintances, so he didn't owe it to me to tell me.\n\nThe weird part, however, is that he has continued to treat me exactly the same as before he was in a relationship.  Anytime we're at the same place, I am his main focus.  He's a gentleman (and shy), so he's never out of line, but he'll ask lots of questions and take an interest in what's going on in my life in a way that goes beyond what even my close friends do.  I recently had a birthday, and he texted me to say happy birthday (we don't text regularly or anything).  \n\nI thanked him but tried to be short as I didn't want it to be misconstrued by his girlfriend.

He's a good guy, and I really don't think he'd cheat on his girlfriend, but I feel a little weird because it seems he may still have a slight crush on me.  I like the guy as a friend and don't want to be rude to him, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate.

I was just wondering if it was normal to every now and again, though very rarely, feel slightly nostalgic for single life? \n\nI love my SO with everything I have - he means the world to me - and I would in no way EVER want to trade being with him for the single life, but I guess after 18 years of single life I'm taking a little time to adjust. I don't miss anything like wanting going out drinking and hooking up with randoms or anything, it's just little stuff, such as having heaps of time to myself (I'm a huge introvert/homebody) or not having to consult/think of anybody else's feelings when changing things about myself (\"Will I be less attractive to him if I...?\"). \n\nSo yes. In no way do I want to be single again - I want to spend the rest of my life with this man - but just sometimes miss some aspects of how life was for me beforehand. Am I alone in this or does everybody get this once in a while?\nTL;DR:"}

He's going out with his friend the day I leave to some bar and has told me that the night is going to be \"legendary\"  and won't tell me what he is doing other than \"guy things\" and getting really drunk. Obviously this all pisses me off on its own... \n\nHe's asked me not to text him at all while he's doing this. I think that's unfair because if he's going to be doing stupid shit like it seems, I feel like I should be able to check on him and make sure he's still alive and made it home safe, etc. Not calling or anything, just checking in, as I usually do when he goes out. He always gets so mad when I do this though, but I just worry when he doesn't answer for like 8 hours and I haven't heard a thing from him. I don't think my request is unreasonable, especially when I said that I don't expect answers right away, just a text or two a night. \n\nAnyways, now he said that he understands this is wrong, but given that I've been upset with him for doing this a couple times in the past, he will just turn the phone off all night. I'll admit, early in our relationship I was too clingy and was kind of bitchy and annoying with him being out, but I've seen my errors and corrected them, only texting maybe twice to ask what they're up to or if he needs a ride. \n\nI don't know if I'm wrong here or if he is, so I would appreciate any other opinions.\nTL;DR:"}

I woke up a bit early and decided to play some computer games with my cousin. I got stuck in an hour long match and before it finished I just got a sudden feeling to go check on her. I found her sitting on my bed and she immediately asked me who owned the pair of underwear that she found.\n\nOn Thursday I had my cleaning lady over to pick my house. She ended up going into my spare room apparently and found a pair of women's underwear and put them on the top of my dirty clothes in that room and I didn't notice. \n\nThese underwear are from before we got together but this cleaning lady screwed me over. She also apparently threw out a bag that had our two boxes of condoms in it. The girl I was seeing was already asking me where the condoms were and I was just telling her that the cleaning lady probably threw them out.\n\nNeedless to say, after finding the underwear, she immediately thought I had seen another woman when she wasn't there. I could not find a good way to really explain the situation in a way that sounded believable. It was one of those weird scenarios where several things piled up and made me look guilty of something when I truly didn't do anything wrong. Very frustrating.\nTL;DR:"}

I certainly didn't.    \n    \n I live with my roommate and our apartment being pretty small; the TV is in his room, which is essentially our living room. We have an apple TV hooked up so I used the airplay feature to watch the streamed content from my computer on the TV. And THAT is how I fucked up.     \n    \nAfter watching the episode, I retire to my bedroom where an uncontrollable carnal urge takes over my body. I check that the coast is clear - my roommate's in the shower (probably for the next half hour - damn him and our ridiculous hydro bills\u2026) The girl he is seeing just arrived, and is in his room with the door closed. Coast is clear, time to begin the marathon.    \n    \nOver the course of the ensuing 20 minutes I let loose my inhibited carnal desires, starting off mildly with some GoneWild action, and eventually progressing to some weirder videos. The kind where you fast-forward to the bits that you want to see then, GTFO before something you don't want to see happens.    \n\nMy 20-minute marathon culminates in the most glorious orgasm. Bucket loads of man-fluid; another sock ruined. I toss the tainted sock and lie back, relishing the post-orgasm afterglow. I hear my roommate come out of the bathroom, enter his room and immediately yell my name. I quickly find some pants and head over to answer his calls, at which point I see the TV in his room is still on, and a mirrored display of my screen, complete with the credits from the \"blond babe fucked doggystyle\" video I climaxed to is up on the screen.    \n    \n\nTurns out I had forgotten to stop airplay, and my roommate's friend (bless her soul) got an active feed of my spank bank material as it happened. I've never officially met her, but she knows more about my sexuality than I ever want anyone to know.\nTL;DR:"}

A brief background on him first: when he was a kid he got diagnosed with some type of learning disability and a mild form of tourrets syndrome. He has always been in classes lower than his grade level. My parents never did anything about that though, partly because my brother is stubborn and refuses help.\n\nHe doesn't have that many friends, he has one friend come over probaly like 1x a month if that. He gained weight because he isn't active anymore. All he does is play XBox all day long in the dark windowless basement. He stays up til 3am every morning playing video games. And sleeps most of the day.\n\nI am worried about his well-being. He just finished his first year of community college (a year after he graduated High School). He has no motivation. Just quit a job he had for less than 1 week. My parents are *on him* and I am afraid that all 3 of them are going to snap very soon.\n\nHe doesn't show any interest in girls, or making new friends for that matter, and I want him to be at least a little social.\n\nI want to help my brother but every time I try to even talk to him casually he flat out **ignores** me. Like all I get in response is a grunt. He is stubborn as hell, reddit. I care about him and I am really worried that he won't ever get a good paying job or get good grades or a social life. He gets into big fights with my parents because he refuses to do anything. He has gotten so lazy. I want to help him find a job but I honestly don't know what to do. I am not exactly sure of what I am asking here. Maybe I shouldn't even be posting this in this sub but like I said, I am new here, maybe it's more of a vent. I really want him to get married one day and have a good life. He can't be happy right now, he just can't...\nTL;DR:"}

Ever since I met her, she's always had an issue with being social, she has a few physical issues that have struck her confidence. \n\nFor one, she has adult acne and two she has a smaller framed body so feels inferior and meek. Because of this, she never developed a social connection in real life nor a real one online, it seemed the quickest way for her to get her \"fix\" of social contact was through sexual advances and flirtation.\n\nSince meeting and being with her, most of our fights and strains have been about her lack happiness and lack of a social life so much she forces herself to become introvert. \n\nRecently I have discovered she has 'found' a friend but this situation is no different. The guy she's gotten to talking to plays the same mmo she plays. The guy constantly flirts on her and hits on her many times and doesn't stop. \n\nI feel like she feels she has to find connections like that because that's the only successful thing that's worked for her in terms of being social, however it concerns me.

Throughout this month, several things have stood out.  Firstly, we don't really talk over the phone/text that often. Secondly, she likes to shit-test me very often. Specifically, she would asked me \" Do you miss me?,\" and never answering that question herself. Or she would ask me if I could bring her younger brother out clubbing to meet girls. Needless to say, I've sidestepped these questions by basically not dignifying them with answers.\n\nI am verbally, and physically affirming to her. She on the other hand, would reciprocate one moment only to play hard to get in the next. This is very frustrating and I have stated that to her on more than one occasion. \n\nLast Sunday evening was a perfect example. We had a great dinner and she was supposed to meet up with one of her best friends after that. Her friend had to cancel due to her feeling unwell and suggested my date hung out with me instead. Over text, her friend referred to me as my date's \"friend.\"\n\nI didn't say anything about that, as we haven't had the 'exclusivity talk' yet. We ended up watching a movie and we were cuddling the whole time, out of her own initiative. I thought that finally broke the intimacy barrier we've had(she is usually much more touchy and open after a drink; she's a pretty stiff person normally).  Unfortunately, our weekday routine of sparse conversation continues.\n\nI am confused. Is she just emotionally not available? If so, why would she want to make holiday plans with me alone? And why bother going on these dates in the first place? I have a feeling that if this drags on for too long, it could become a \" friends with benefits\" situation, and I am definitely not cool with that. I have always been a relationship kind of person; a FWB relationship is just emotionally toxic for me from my one experience before.

He has no job, and no car or anything, which makes it very difficult to live in North Carolina. But apparently he got a job scrubbing dishes at a bar and bought a moped last month.\n\nThe biggest problem with him is that he is manipulative and is driving a wedge between my sister and her family. His personality is the worst, he's one of those one-uppers, who thinks he's a beer connoisseur (he's only 21 and his favorite beer is bud light)(He also looks like he's 15). He thinks he knows everything and will bullshit you about all his accomplishments and hobbies...like playing the guitar...poorly.

I'm a relatively ambitious person and I was planning on using this summer to expand my resume and build some more marketable skills in preparation for grad school applications next fall. \n\nEssentially, I can't figure out if this is a situation that requires a *choice*. I want to move in with him one day but the summertime isn't convenient for me or my academic aspirations. But it feels like this is my boyfriend's attempt to take the \"first step\" towards a more serious relationship and he wants to use the summer as a less stressful opportunity to see if we can live together before trying to do it during the school year. \n\nI can't figure out a way to *both* live with him and do something productive over the summer so, in my estimations, it seems like I have to choose. \n\nThis decision is about 6 months away so there's time but I do need to know if I should be looking into internships/employment since most application deadlines are approaching.\nTL;DR:"}

Last week I began a lower-carb diet- no sugar, pasta, rice, fruit, flour, or starchy veggies like potatoes.  I also am moving to \"whole-food\" sources of fat- eating almonds and avocados but using as little oil as possible when cooking.  I'm also trying to get more on the ball with trail running after a slump.  I *think* all of this is helping but it's hard to tell because my scale is cheap and weird and shows up to 7 pound fluctuations in a day, but weight seems to be trending downish, and I feel pretty good.  \n\nMy question- for all the low-carbers out there- is it still beneficial to reduce carbs even if it doesn't send you into ketosis?  I ask because I really need to eat legumes on a daily basis for protein and calories, and because of this I'm eating probably between 45 and 60 grams of carbs a day. Will this work? Also, does anyone have any good low-carb, high protein vegan food suggestions?  Right now I'm eating a metric ton of veggies a day, especially leafy greens, and tofu, unsweetened soy milk, nuts, a couple of servings of beans daily, edamame, and that's about it.  Like I said, I feel good and don't have any cravings at all (pleasant surprise) but the menu can get a \nlittle boring!\nTL;DR:"}

It left me feeling incompetent and am wondering what I can do to improve.\nPOST: Lately I have been hanging out with a guy and, after getting to know him, have developed feelings for him. We are neither in a relationship nor are we dating but we do have feelings for one another. About a week ago, we ended up having sex. My partners in the past haven't been too experienced but he was. As a result the sex was great. \n\nHowever, there was one major issue: I didn't last long enough! I honestly can't remember how long it lasted but had it been with one of my previous partners it would have been long enough for him to finish.\n\nI ended up getting dry and we just stopped. I just wasn't wet anymore and we didn't really bother trying to did it again after that. He explained that it's happened to him in the past and that it's not a big deal. Basically he was super sweet, understanding, and comforting. Regardless, I couldn't help the feelings of inadequacy. This has never happened to me and iI have only ever had the opposite happen to me i.e. I last longer than my partner.\n\nI tried to look this up but haven't had much luck with finding resources.

Last night me and my friedns and her went to a pub, (i always buy her everything) and bought her some shots.  We were having a good time, until this guy(her old bio teacher) was drunk there.  He kept looking at her ass, trying to touch it and then finally went up and grabbed her by the wasit(they were playing darts alone).  I said something to him like , hey if your wife was here would you like it if I did that, so he stopped and for ONCE my gf agreed.  \n\nAnyways, after that we went home and i went upstairs to get on a phone call real quick (friends and her are downstairs).  She starts blasting music at 12:00 AM and i always get teh cops called on me for this so i haves topped for a while now.  I come downstairs and ask who did that, and turned the music down.  (Keep in mind this is my own purchased home).  She said, I did, you're such a bitch right now.  She repeated it, then kept saying nasty comments in front of my friends.  I got fed up(when shes drunk shes a whole different person, but always says shes not drunk, and i always have to stop her from driving).  Anyways I had had enough and went upstairs got all her clothes and started dumping them on the couch and put as much as i could fit in her car and told her to get out.  Was i wrong here?

She looked at me and kind of shrugged her shoulders and gave me a \"well, yeah, probably\"\n\nDuring those hours of sleep I started thinking about our vacation.

He was being really affectionate and all over me in front of these other people and I kissed him back but gently reminded him not to gross the others out (we were there with friends, a uni club). Then we dance for a bit, I leave the dance floor to get another drink and tell him so, then sit down at the table to drink it. While doing so I glanced across at the dance floor and saw him dancing with another girl and literally groping her ass.\n\nI FREAKED out. I started crying. I haven't been in a relationship in such a long time and I just hate feeling helpless and jealous and angry. I was so pissed off at him, he kept trying to kiss me and makeup but I just said I couldn't talk to him while I was so mad and we had both been drinking. The next day we talked and he realised why that was hurtful and promised never to do that again.\n\nIs this a bad sign for our relationship? I feel like running away so I don't have to feel bad, and become some overly jealous girlfriend. \nDid I overreact? How can I stop worrying about losing control of my emotions?\nTL;DR:"}

I've finally decided to get back into dating, but it seems to me that all the interesting people are already taken, or aren't interested in me. I've been turned down, or blown off multiple times over the last month or so. It's really dampened my spirits. I have a good opinion of myself, I'm not trying to throw myself a pity party, but sometimes it gets frustrating to finally put yourself back out there only to get turned away. What advice do you have to someone looking to date but getting turned away at the door?\n\nI realized this was super vague thanks to /u/intripletime, so here's some backstory.\n    My last girlfriend and I broke up because we could rarely see each other. Between my military requirements and her school duties there were very few weekends we could meet up. She was the girl I was convinced I could marry, so when the breakup came I stopped wanting to date ever. This was about two years ago, and I've now got a steady career both civilian side and with the military, and now I'm hoping to find someone I can spend my time with. Any women I end up talking to either invariably reveal that they're spoken for, or that they're not interested in seeing me. As far as why, a common answer is that they're not over their last relationship. Understandable, as I've just barely gotten over mine. I'm unsure of what I can do to get my foot in the door with dating, because it's been a long time and I've come to realize I'm not very good at it.\nTL;DR:"}

She's adorable and one of the most well behaved puppies I have ever seen. Technically she is my dog but I go to college most of the year so she stays at home with my family. Keep an eye out for her, she's important to the story.\n\nSo I was trying to surprise my family with dinner. I'm a terrible cook and I only know a few dishes so I decided to make spaghetti and meatballs, pretty simple right? Well I was boiling water and I needed to use the bathroom, I was probably gone 5 minutes tops, but when I came back the the kitchen the 2 pound package of ground beef was gone. At first I thought that I had forgotten to take it out or maybe I just placed it somewhere else. It took a couple minutes but I eventually found the culprit...My 70 pound puppy had jumped on the counter and eaten the entire package. And not just the meat, but the styrofoam, plastic, etc. So I had to take the cute little idiot to the vet instead of making dinner. I guess that's what I get for trusting a puppy.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 21, my friend is 23, but my friend has never had a license and has only drove maybe a handful of times.

My current body fat percentage is 29% and my lean body mass is 149.1 lbs.. To go about lowering body fat percentage I was recommended by my trainer to go on portion control, while others said to do lots of cardio, and go on a calorie deficit. \n\n   So to begin with my first question,\n1.) I find it really boring to do cardio alone unless someone is there to push me or if there is someone doing cardio. Otherwise, I find it REALLY easy to quit a few minutes in. I am looking for a solution to not quit so easily. Also, what is the best type of cardio workout to cut body fat %, whether it be sprinting, long distance jogging, weight resistance workouts, etc.?\n\n2.) I want to be very strict with my diet but my willpower is just way too weak. People who eat healthy are usually disgusted by fast food and junk food but I cannot help myself when it comes to it. I was told that if I cannot cut it out of my life then I would have to go on portion control. Is there a way to teach yourself to eat healthy and not binge on junk food? I would rather find a way to teach myself to cut it out of my life completely rather than having to cut down on portions.\n\n3.) I was told a lot of methods to cut my body fat %, whether it be portion control, counting calories, counting macros, cardio, etc. but in the end I am still looking for a solution for cutting down my body fat % substantially in the best way possible, what do you reccommend?\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated, I want to live a healthier life and it would mean the world if you could help out even in the slightest.\nTL;DR:"}

I've tried a dozen dry shampoos, washing around the hairline, etc. Nothing works -- my hair looks greasy, my scalp is itchy, etc.  I have no choice except to wash my entire head. And no, I can't just condition because the hair needs to actually be washed to get the sweat out. I regularly use very expensive deep conditioners and other treatments to maintain hair health because my hair is so prone to dryness.\n\nI know this comes across as a shallow post, but I can't be alone in my frustration.

I have a job they don't know about so I could financially support myself even though it would be rough at first but I don't want to completely cut ties with my parents or anything.  \n\nThey yell at me and tell me I'm not a good child. But then they turn around and say they love me and want me to do well but always make me feel like I'm not enough. Also I have a black boyfriend whom they've met (but not as my boyfriend, as a friend) and they hate him and want me to stop hanging out with him. Even though they don't know he's my boyfriend.\n\nSorry if this didn't flow well but these feelings have been building up for a while and I don't know exactly how to explain myself to strangers. I really want to talk to them about this soon but I'm not sure at all how to go about it. I still love them but it's very hard to deal with everything they put on me and I really can't stay in their house any longer. I'm planning on talking to them tonight or something and was basically looking for guidance on what to say.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by going to work on a Sunday\nPOST: Happened yesterday (NO ONE CARES).\n\nSo Saturday night i was at a house warming, drinking as one does at these things and because i am a good boy i slept on the couch and drove the next day. After dropping my friend off i decide to head to work to catch up on some work as I have been falling behind and havent had time for an already overdue task.\n\nSo while driving down the highway i start noticing that my car is driving more smoothly then usual. Also what is that ticking noise whenever i try and accelerate, also why does my car not accelerate. So i make it to my turn off and as i slow down i realise that my car was only maintaining the momentum. Now it has none. So i roll the car to the nearest petrol station to park and call my Dad because cars are not exactly my strong suit. His diagnosis is that im only running on 3 cylinders at the moment so its time for an impromptu service i guess. Only its Sunday and everything is closed. After spending most of the day looking for some spark plugs we manage to find some in a semi dodgy area. That didnt work.\n\nNow its late so everything is definately closed now so just leave the car there. \n\nNow i dont have Transport to work but its chilled i can take the train. Only i can also take the wrong train and land up and land up in an even more dodgy area then the last place. Put it this way when people say you dont wanna go there its THAT place. So i pucker my arsehole clutch my phone tight and catch the train out of there and now i am half an hour late for work. \n\nALSO a plus is i have NO IDEA what i did wrong or what train line im supposed to be on even now. SO I guess its time for round two tomorrow.\n\nAnd im going try something new to fix the car and if that doesnt work, well its going to cost 10 times more to fix it.\nTL;DR:"}

Here's the worst part, I was scared, never even had a ticket before this in my life and my  lawyer said that the deal they were offering was the best I could get (14 days community service, fines, anger management class and 3 years of summary probation) so I took it. \n\nI just tried to have the public defenders office get rid of my summary probation (I'm a year and 4 months into it now) and start the expungement process but they told me that they won't do anything until I'm at least 2/3 of the way through the 3 years (July 2012) and that I have to show good reason, even though I did everything the court asked a whole year ago.\n\nOkay last part. I have to renew my green card, probably should send the forms in April as it expires in August of 2012.

I had my mid-year review with her a couple weeks after that so I figured I would get it after that was done.

So I've been waiting for a random email again just like that one, but I'm kind of losing hope. The company is going through a lot of changes right now, all seemingly positive. They're looking into raising venture capital and there's also the possibility of being acquired (which I'm not too excited about for the sake of my job security), so I'm not sure if maybe they're withholding a raise because of those potential changes.\n\nI'm wondering if I should ask my boss about the raise, and how would I go about asking?

I have a couple questions and a request for advice.\nPOST: The back story: I graduated high school in 2005. I was always really into science and mathematics in high school,  and was urged by my parents and counselors to pursue an engineering degree. I took their advice, and that fall I started classes at a small, nearby, well-respected engineering school. From the first week, I should have realized that the school I picked and the major I picked were completely wrong for me; I hated the campus, couldn't stand the courses, and had a very hard time getting to know anyone on campus.  I started drinking a lot, and spent the vast majority of my time in my dorm room, skipping class and watching movies. I failed the majority of my classes my freshman year, but rather than taking a step back and changing schools, or majors, or taking some time off, I kept this up for another four semesters. I passed barely enough of my classes to avoid getting kicked out. I finally decided to just stop going after the Spring 2008 semester, and haven't gone back since. In the meantime, I've landed a job working retail, and I've kind of decided I don't want to do that for the rest of my life. \n\nThat being said, I've decided I want to go back to school. I want to major in something science-related; either biology or chemistry. My questions are these: Is it realistic to think I can go back and finish a degree? If so, how bad did I mess up my chances of getting into grad school afterwards, if I decide to do that? Am I less likely to find a job graduating at 27 instead of 22? If I start back at a community college, would it bode poorly for future job opportunities? How do I avoid getting into the same rut the way I did the first time? And my biggest concern; is it worth trying higher education again? Or should I come to terms with the fact that I'm a college dropout and try to figure something else out?\n\nSorry for the wall-o'-text.\nTL;DR:"}

He ended up meeting a really great girl who is a much better match for him than I ever was and I'm really happy for him.\n\nWe started hanging out together again in groups and one-on-one, and nothing has happened between us since the break up. There weren't any residual feelings and we've both discussed it multiple times to make sure that we felt comfortable being friends.\n\nAnyway, I've introduced him to friends as a friend, but sometimes friends/people ask if we're together. I tell them honestly that we dated for a bit, but we ended things amicably and we're just friends.\n\nSeveral people have told me it was weird that we still hang out. Others have told me that we're acting our age and are being adults about it (just because we didn't work out, doesn't mean we can't be friends, right?)\n\nHowever, it's been weighing on me lately and I'm wondering if it's having an effect on my dating life. I'm not a serial dater and I'm not looking for anything serious, but I'm wondering if this type of friendship could really hinder having a serious relationship down the line?\n\nI really don't have any kind of romantic feelings towards him, so it's not a matter of that. Would it weird you out if you were dating someone who was friendly with their ex?\nTL;DR:"}

Not sure if this is a problem or not.\nPOST: Hey, so here's the deal. My boyfriend and I generally have a good relationship. We never really fought about anything, except maybe once or twice over the course of half a year (the part I'm about to explain).  However, there is something that has been bothering me quite a bit, and I am not sure if this is an actual problem, or just me being hyper-sensitive.  He tends to insult quite me a lot, but he doesn't (seem) to intend to, and if so, in a joking kind of way.  He would say things like \"why are you so stupid?\" or \"why do I have to do all the thinking for you?\" and such.  He does think highly of himself, which doesn't bother me.  It's when he says these things that bothers me.  I've talked about him about this a few times before, but this hasn't really solved anything.  The conversation would just end in him saying that he either doesn't remember what he said, or that I just took it the wrong way and it was a joke.  He never apologized about it.  After a while, I tried to just ignore it, but it still really bothers me and I'm not really sure what to do at this point.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: Please help with fighting female guinea pigs (xpost from /r/guineapigs)\nPOST: We've got a rather specific problem with a pair of female guinea pigs. They've been raised together from being very young and have started to play dominance games. At first we were sure it was because they were in a fairly small cage. We don't have a massive amount of space but we get them both out pretty regularly.\n\nTo try and fix the space issue we bought a double height cage with a ramp. I know, I know - after some looking around on the internet this wasn't too wise; they don't seem happy with steep ramps.\n\nWe're considering fixing up the cage ourselves to make the ramp longer and less steep but we're not sure if it's even worth doing yet - they really don't seem to get on, even for a few minutes.\n\nThe main reason I'm posting is because it doesn't seem like normal behaviour. One guinea pig is particularly dominant and the other is simply terrified. We can put them together for hours at a time and all that happens is the second pig sits in a corner completely motionless, occasionally gets chased round and generally sounds scared whenever the other one comes near. When separated the aggressive pig becomes incredibly stressed and squeals a lot seemingly out of loneliness - but the timid one gets so much happier. The aggressive one is also absolutely fine with us. She's never bitten anyone as far as I know (and they've never drawn each other's blood).\n\nI should also note that we separated them for about a week and bathed both pigs thoroughly before we reintroduced them in the new cage to remove all previous odors. This didn't seem to do a great deal. Well, they smelled a lot nicer, obviously.\n\nSo now I'm not so sure actually connecting the two cages will help. Any advice out there?\nTL;DR:"}

I have tried the whole time living in our house together to get her to do chores on a regular basis but it always ends up with me doing it and taking over doing it weekly. It started with dishes, then we bought a dishwasher and it still wasnt easy enough. Now laundry, i have to do all of my own laundry this past weekend and our whole room floor is covered in her dirty clothes. We go a dog, which she used to take to work with her but now doesnt and i take care of him when we are both home. Initiating sex is also something i have to do. So after coming home every night and cooking, cleaning, making sure all the bills are paid and taking care of our dog, i have to get over whatever resentment i have to try to have sex with her but it is sometimes a no go even then and that just leads to more frustration. She has body image issues and anxiety. I just dont think she is cut out to be a mom because i cant take on any more burdens to keep our life together. We have talked about all of these issues as they came up but the solutions always ended up with me taking over the duty. \n\nOur arguments always stop half way through from either a snarky, fine your right im wrong i give up from her and she is still mad, or a slamming of bathroom door and its put on hold for 15 minutes at a time.\n\nNow i dont know what to do, im always mad now and im thinking about divorce since the break would be cleaner now then if we accidentally got pregnant.\nTL;DR:"}

What I am struggling with is trying to understand how the interest works.\n\nI know my interest is 1.873% pcm, as that is stated on my statements.  The card started with 3 months interest free.\n\nI'll try and explain better.  \n\nI started to pay interest on the card in August, and by then I had spent \u00a3994.66.\n\nIn August, with a balance of \u00a3994.66 it calculated that I owed an interest of \u00a318.17.  According to my maths, \u00a318.17 of \u00a3994.66 is 1.826%.  I paid \u00a350 off that month.\n\nIn Septemer, with a balance of \u00a31210.23 I had incurred 26.82 in interest.  Again, this is not 1.873% - instead 2.216%.  Once again I paid off a flat \u00a350.\n\nMy most recent statement, October, I had a balance of \u00a31198.61.  Interest here was \u00a320.34 (1.696%).  I couldn't pay the \u00a350 I planned so left it to minimum, which was worked out to be \u00a338.53.\n\nThanks to a purchase refund this month, November will have a balance of \u00a31127.57.

SO I decided that to save her heart break I would break up with her, to save her in the long run. It took me several weeks to break up with her, because I really did not want to, but my convictions were playing on me. So one day when we were eating lunch, I finally worked up the courage to do so. Through my tears, snot and convulsive nervous shaking, I broke up with her. I went to my dorm and didn't eat for a few days. To me it looked like she took it all in stride... Fast forward almost ten years ( July 2014) after years of on again off again communication as friends, she finally expresses an interest in dating me again. I had been through a couple of disappointing break ups between 2006 and now, and I learned a few life lessons along the way, so We decided to date again.

I could even just lay in my room and fall in and out of sleep all day while watching DVD's of Seinfeld.\n\nBut then, I realized that museums aren't open 24 hours a day, so I would need to know when it was open before I drove there and when it closed (or even if it was open that day), necessitating a clock.

The water hole I drive to probably closes at a certain time (whether it's private or public), and so I'd need to keep that in mind, necessitating a clock.

The obvious happened and we both very drunkenly had sex.\n\nNow she's just called and said that she wants to terminate the pregnancy and given that neither of us have a moral standpoint that seems like the logical thing. That being said, I need to be there for someone who is really just only ever going to be a friend. I really don't think either of us want to have a baby together, and I don't want to be an asshole to her, but how do I ensure that this is \"taken care of\" without coming off inconsiderate?\n\nAny advice for how to be there for her? How I can help or just plain not make things worse? I am in Australia if that helps.\nTL;DR:"}

Christmas has always been her favorite holiday because our grandpa was her Santa and he made it so wonderful for her that she's passed it on to us, her kids. \n\nNow I'm 17 so I don't really believe in Santa any more but my older brother and I always loved waking up to Christmas as a kid, it was magical. We had a huge inflatable snowglobe one time with fake snow in it and big stockings over filled, we even had a small train driving around a tree before. Real trees that smelt like pine and dirt, it was beautiful with ornaments and lights perfectly placed. The cookies and milk gone with a hanwritten note from Santa telling us how much he loved us, Christmas music playing and hot chocolate with those mini marshmallows in them would be set aside for us. We would sprinkle glitter all over the front yard to for \"Reindeer magic\" and have carrots out for them as well. I could go on forever. Everything was just spectacular because of Santa, my mom.\n\nAnyway the point is that Christmas was everything to us, so we're making it special for my little brothers because they should enjoy Christmas as much as we did growing up. My little brothers have their own teddy bear collection and love them with all their heart so my mother bought a 7ft, 9inch teddy bear from Costco. It was also the very last one, after searching for two weeks for them and cost us the lighting bill. We won't have lights for two weeks but for her it's worth it to her on Christmas, for them to wake up and run to the living room and see this huge bear just for them. \n\nMy job was to hide it till then. I forgot to lock my door and in came one of my little brothers to tell me it was time for dinner. Fuck.\n \nMy mum is now crying because the magic was lost, the bear was supposed to be the magical gift from Santa for my little brothers.\nTL;DR:"}

He's always supported me emotionally, and for some of our time together (including at present), financially as well. We have a solid relationship, we live together, and we're set to get married. There's no feeling of me owing him anything for everything he's done for me.\n\nI want to do more things to show him how much I love and care about him. \n\nThe problem is, he's the sole breadwinner right now (I'm working on a startup right now, so while I'm working, I'm not currently making money), so I don't have my own money to spend on gifts, trips, or other surprises for him. He's the better cook, and though I'm getting better at it, my schedule doesn't always allow me to be home for dinner. He's also the one paying for groceries, so I don't always feel like preparing a nice meal is \"something nice\", since it comes out of his pocket. \n\nHe's a really self-sufficient, independent person. I keep the house clean, do most of the laundry, run errands for him whenever he needs, and do most of the grocery shopping (albeit with his money).\n\nWhat else can I do for him that doesn't cost money, and doesn't necessarily require a go-ahead from him? I'd love to be able to give him things he doesn't ask for, but I know he would love.\nTL;DR:"}

Made a throwaway. So my boyfriend(22M), of 3 on and off years with me (20F), has quit smoking for about 10 months now. However when he goes to work every here and there when I kiss him I can taste tobacco in his mouth. He has friends at work who heavily smoke and who he hangs around with. And when I question him he denies smoking, chewing, dipping, or anything. \n\nI feel completely lied to and sort of helpless because I can't follow him to work with binoculars and watch his every move. I sort of have to take his word. But today was the last straw. I was making out with him and I noticed that he hesitated kissing me with his tongue and as soon as he did I tasted tobacco.\nNow, people's mouth don't randomly taste like tobacco unless if they have been smoking. And he keeps standing his ground and saying that he has not been smoking. I tell him how disrespectful it is that he is lying to me and that I don't believe him because his mouth tastes like tobacco.\n\nI'm asking for a nicotine/tobacco test. However would it work if let's say he only had a few huffs of a cigarette for just today? Or is it normal for people's mouth to taste like tobacco if they hang around other smokers? I've always given him the benefit of a doubt, but I feel like I'm going crazy. I want answers or someone else's opinion.\nTL;DR:"}

It was literally all she wanted to talk about for a very long time (again, years). I understood. I stuck through it with her, keeping in mind what a great person she is to be around when she isn't in this funk. I spent hours talking her through panic attacks, sad nights, etc.\n\nFour years later, she finally agreed to go on meds and started acting like her old self. Her spirits were back up and I was thrilled for her. But several months ago she started falling back into her old habits -- I don't think she has once asked me or our other friends how we're doing, and just CONSTANTLY talks about her anxiety and her bad luck with men. There is literally no conversation that cannot be somehow linked back to her emotional problems, because unfortunately mental illness can consume people's lives. And we genuinely try to help her! We'll talk to her about things for hours. But it's not enough; she'll even call her exes and cry about other guys she's having problems with, or her issues. \n\nI'm just starting to get really tired, I guess. I have my own issues to deal with and at the moment am going through extreme stress. I want to be a good friend, and I feel terrible for saying this, but... after many years, it's starting to get REALLY annoying. I know that many people with depression report feeling abandoned, and I really don't want to do that to her. But I feel like this friendship is starting to feel one-sided, and I can't think of a solution. She has kept a journal for YEARS, she's still on meds, she's in therapy and has been for awhile, and she frequently says she \"doesn't have that many people to talk about this with\". Is there another solution that I'm missing?\nTL;DR:"}

He, she, and another coworker went for a hiking trip, and her employer posted 10 photos of the hiking trip, four of which are pictures of her, the rest being of scenery.\n\nMy girlfriend is coming back home for a week at the end of February before going to Europe until June.

How do I let him down without ruining the friendship?\nPOST: I moved to the city a couple years ago and made a friend who introduced me to her friends. One of them and I hit it off right away with and we began to hang out quite a bit. Never during this time was I ever flirty, intimate, or suggestive in any way, he even told me he never got the impression I ever wanted anything more (his words). But, he fell for me and is now kind of freaking out about it.\n\nI am not a \"relationship person\". I don't like being touched, making out, cuddling, or even sex. I'm about as platonic as a person could be. I know he wants the whole relationship shebang (no pun intended). This is not something I am capable of at this time in my life and I don't feel for him any more than a friend. He is also not what I am looking for in a partner on top of me not wanting to be in a relationship with anyone. I've explained this to him, that I don't want to be intimate with anyone and that it's not personal but it seems to go in one ear and out the other. I've never fallen for anyone before and don't know what it's like to be around someone who I feel differently about than they do, so it's hard for me to relate to where he's coming from or understand his perspective. \n\nThe problem is this. My friend and I have built a really tight knit group of friends of which both me and him are a part of. I'm worried his inability to deal with this is going to destroy that friend group. It is currently the only group of friends I have and they are extremely important to me. I do not want to lose them. I know things will probably change between me and this guy but I don't want to lose everyone I care about in the process.\n\nWe're going to grab drinks in a couple days and talk it through. I could really use some perspective or insight on what I should do or how I should handle this.\nTL;DR:"}

My idea of a Saturday is to get up at 12-1pm, have a date starting at 8:30 or 9pm, and stay up until 3am.\n\nWhat this means is that I miss out on a lot of morning activities with her (eg, going to church with her, or having a morning run with her), and she misses out on late night activities with me (most of my friends are evening people too, for example, so she often can't hang out with my friends too long).\n\nWe've been trying to meet in the middle, where I try to be up by 10ish so I could have brunch with her, for example, and she tries to stay out later if she's out with me and my friends.

We did not break up, and we did not say that we wouldn't be getting back together come the next year. We did agree to keep our relationship open and stay in touch. She has never lied to me, and I have never lied to her. Our relationship was solid, we didn't end on a bad note or a fight or anything like that. \n--\nFor the first couple of weeks of summer, everything was cool. We would talk via text or Facebook every couple of days or so. We kept conversation pretty casual, except for the occasional 'I miss you'. And then one day she just stopped talking to me. That was about a month and a half ago. In the time since, I have sent her two text messages (both just said 'Hey'), a single Facebook message (again just saying 'Hey'), and I've tried to call her once. I never got any sort of response. \n--\nI'm not so much concerned about her seeing someone new or anything like that. I just can't understand why she would just completely sever communication with me. Especially after we both agreed at the start of our relationship to always be up front with each other. She never did anything like this before.  Even when I upset her or did something to make her mad she always told me. I've never had to deal with someone just completely dropping communication with me. Is this her way of telling me everything is over? Do I need to just play it cool and ignore it? Should I try and get back in touch with her when school starts back? I have no idea how to proceed with this.\nTL;DR:"}

She's really perfect for me, and we get along really really well.  We are currently in a long-distance relationship because of college, but she plans on moving in with me upon graduation.  \n\nWhen we first started dating, T was a very shy person and I was her first boyfriend/first time.  Me, on the other hand, had a few girlfriends and partners throughout highschool.  We see each other about 3-4 times a year for a week or so, and during that time of course we have sex (Decent, not the best I've had not the worst).  The main problem being that she is really tight so it often hurts her, no matter the amount of foreplay/lube.  I'm really gentle with her, and confident that it'll be a lot better once we live together, but for now it's really difficult because she gets tight again every time I see her.  \n\nRecently, she brought up the idea of having a one-time, one night stand.  She's curious to see how sex is different with another person (Since we plan on getting married, I'd be her only partner ever, and I can sort've understand the curiosity).  She said I can also have a one-night stand with someone of my choosing, but frankly I'm not really interested.  I told her that I'd think about it, but I'm leaning towards no, it feels like a bad idea.  \n\nHow should I approach this?\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half.  We share an apartment together and work opposite schedules, so we don't actually see that much of each other.  In fact I have kind of gotten used to being by myself.  As time has gone on I have become less and less physically attracted to him, to the point where I don't even want to cuddle or be cuddled by him or even hold hands.  Obviously this is not acceptable and not fair to him, so about a week or so ago I tried to break up with him.  I did not focus on the lack of attraction, but instead on other true elements of our relationship, such as that we no longer have much in common and that I have zero sex drive and that we rushed into living together.  He said he was blind-sided even though I had been noticeably more quiet, depressed, and reserved for the past month or so.  He pleaded with me not to throw the whole relationship away.  I told him I would \"sleep on it\" and ended up agreeing to give it more time.  I emphasized that I couldn't make any guarantees though.\n\nNow it has been a little over a week and I think things are even worse.  He is acting like nothing happened and wanting to go out with me to dinner/movies and long walks.  I feel like everything I said was just glossed over and he thinks I was just having a bad night or something.  I can't handle the pressure and I know he is expecting me to be affectionate again.

It's really difficult to explain, but we bicker so much, but yet we are incredibly close. We did mess around a little bit last New Years, but it was nothing passed second base. I should mention however, that we were incredibly baked and a bit tipsy that night.

I just feel like she and I are going to do it sometime relatively soon. I'm not even nervous. It's so hard to explain. I don't even know.

However I found out I'm moving to another country and we decided to take it day by day and see what happens. I recently packed up and left to move a few days ago.  I'll be gone at least one year. He seems okay with it, I seem okay with it. I feel like we're in a good place in our relationship and it won't be terrible. My boyfriend has never lived abroad  before and doesn't handle change well.

He's a bit older than me and He recently called me randomly and we talked on the phone a few times and he understands more than my boyfriend... especially with what I'm going through. He previously did the program I'm about to do and actually applied but got wait listed.  So he may or may not be going as well. He's been incredibly helpful and I genuinely enjoy talking to him, probably a lot more than I enjoy talking to my boyfriend right now. I feel all nervous and cute and those feelings I had when I started originally talking to my boyfriend before we started dating.. Like for some reason I just really like talking to him. \n\nI know nothing will probably ever happen with Guy B. I'm okay with this, but it just makes me think differently about my boyfriend and makes me realize that Guy B offers more attributes and more what I'm looking for in a relationship. \n\nShould I take this as a sign that my boyfriend and I aren't going to work?

The other girl was thin, great in bed, hilarious and intelligent. The girl I'm with now is a little chubbier, she tries in bed, and a little below average in terms of intelligence. She's so kind hearted and innocent, I feel bad to think it, but there are times I would love to just go back to my ex and act upon what I've been missing.\n\nIf I left my current GF, I feel like I'd be breaking up with her entire family and also disappointing my own at this point considering how much my parents love her too. The reason this all came to mind today was because my ex message me and asked to see me for the first time in 2 years. I just said maybe some other time, but it's all I can think about.

I bonded with several of them and we all generally became quite close friends through them telling me about their problems in school and sometimes outside of school. I helped as best I could according to each situation, but for this one girl, let's call her Maggie, we got exceptionally close. Throughout the past year, we sort of became \"big brother\" and \"little sister\" and this is how I want our relationship to stay like. I must admit that I love her with all my heart, but for me, it's as a sister, not as a romantic interest. And then I moved away for college and I haven't seen her in a while, but now I'm back for Spring Break and we decided to go hang out together during the week...\n\nAnd so, here's my problem, I've never once in my life hung out with a girl one on one in a non-romantic setting. She doesn't know what she want's to do, and neither do I. All of my ideas for us hanging out are too romantic and so I come to you, the wonderful people of reddit for advice on where to go, what activity to do, etc. with Maggie. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I have (what I think is) a great idea. I wanted Reddit's help/advice in bringing it to fruition.\nPOST: Basically, my idea is this. A lot of people in the world are employed at a level where they have slightly more than enough money to get by, but not enough to puruse their dreams, buy anything extravagant, go wild with spending etc.  \nI thought it would be cool to set up a kind of 'community lottery' project. Collect signups from a thousand people, and every week the members would contribute a dollar into a 'pot'. We then randomly select a participant, and that person is awarded with the thousand dollar pot.  \nAt only a dollar a week, that's only fifty two dollars a year - probably more than affordable for most people. And with the chance of being gifted a thousand dollars - I feel that's a substantial enough amount of money to make someone's week feel pretty awesome.  \nI wanted your guys' help because I realize there are a huge amount of logistical problems with setting something like this up. Ensuring a regular payment schedule from each participant doesn't waiver... finding a reliable way to collect funds in the first place... impartially judging the random selection for each week... all those and a host of others. I think it's a cool idea in and of itself; a way to donate a dollar a week to make another person in the world extremely happy, with a chance to wind up with a thousand dollars for yourself.  \nSo basically, I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions on how to make this work. The complete list of problems as I see it;  \n* **Ensuring authenticity of the program (eg. making sure people can guarantee it's not just a way for me to take their money and vanish)**  \n* **Ensuring a reliable method of regular payment - making sure that people feel their money is safe and going to the right place**  \n* **Setting up an impartial manner in which to judge the winner for each week**  \n* **Just in general, ironing out kinks in the system - would be more evident if I had done something like this before...**  \n\nSo... what do you guys think? Is this doable? Suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}

Somehow my dad worked it out such that he wouldn't loose everything to the state to cover these expenses once my mother passed away.\n\nI've heard from my mother-in-law that upon receipt of my parents death certificates, the state could come looking for reparations to pay back some of what was due for covering my mother's medical expenses almost a decade ago.  \n\nI have essentially spent zero of what I've received so far, and I'm afraid to do much of anything with it at this point until I understand what could happen.

He found out he had to move across the country shortly after, so we kept it casual but continued to see each other. He moved in August and after we determined if we could sustain a LDR, we officially became a couple in September.\n\nSince he moved, we've been in contact every day. Long-distance calls are pricey and he works for 21 straight days on an oil rig, then has 6 days off. We usually text every single day, as often as possible, and call when he's able. We also visit each other every 2nd break he gets, alternating who travels. We've discussed moving in together next summer (we'd have been dating for over a year) but haven't worked out details yet.\n\nHowever, this last week our communication has dried up completely. He's on a break right now, and he's been texting me to check in once a day, we have a quick conversation, then going MIA. He leaves to play video games or go to his friends house, and I don't hear from him again until the next day. \n\nI feel like I'm being paranoid, but this is really weird. We went from constant communication to barely anything in a matter of days. I'd like to think he's just comfortable with our situation and doesn't feel the need to constantly talk in order to know we're together, but I can't help but worry because he's always so accessible to me even during his work period, and now that he's off he's barely messaging me and hardly responding when I reach out to him.\n\nI'm going to see him in 3 weeks. He says he's excited and can't wait to see me, that he's bought me a Christmas present and he'll be driving 6 hours each way to pick me up from the airport. We're splitting the travel costs. I've invested time and money and so has he. I really, really like him and if he just needs time to himself, I can adapt and give him space. But I just want to make sure he's not over it, because it's really going to hurt, especially after I see him in person.\nTL;DR:"}

This completely blindsided me and now I have no idea what to do because its such a confusing place I'm in right now. \n\nShe lives 3 hours away from me, we've only been going out for 2 months, and I've known her since new years. We met online, and I've seen her 3 times during those 2 months, multiple days on those 2 occasions I stayed with her. I'm pretty sure she has depression, and she also has the rod in her arm so her hormones are changing dramatically and she even told me that. She said she doesn't have a reason why she stopped loving me and she's just as confused as I am. When we were talking about if it was the end of  our relationship she said \"I guess so\" and didn't even bother to fight for us and try to work it out. \n\nI'm going to go see her next weekend to try and sort things out and hopefully win her back since I love her with all my heart. She's 17, I'm 18 and I think the main reason she doesn't love me anymore is because we barely see each other, we've never talked on the phone or through skype, only  through text.\nTL;DR:"}

Unfortunately, our life paths seem to be going different directions. I know this is an all too common topic, but being in it is seems so difficult.\n\nShe has defined goal to have children (her first) by end of 37. She knows the research about women having kids after 35 so she's freaking out a bit. But she also just wants to have a family soon, which is fine. She has a very stable job, living situation, family, friends, etc. so that's all good. \n\nI want a family, but not sure if I'm ready to have one at 37. I told my girlfriend this, but she's has a hard deadline of 37. That's only about 2+ years away from me and I still have some goals I want to complete before I have a family. There's also some other reasons why I don't think it's a good idea such as I don't have much money saved up and live in the most expensive city in the US. I want a family, but I can't put a specific age or time around when that will be. If it happens great, but if not, then maybe it wasn't to be or the timing was never right.\n\nShe risks having kids too late, having medical issues, or simply not having kids if she stays with me. If I stay with her, I risk having a family when I'm not ready and regretting my choices in life and being resentful. \n\nTo me it sucks that two people can find each other and love each other, but because of timing or because we're scared of not achieving our goals together that the relationship will end prematurely. Also, i think things are different when you're 35 as opposed to 25. At this age nobody wants to waste anyone's time or energy and time flies so much faster.\nTL;DR:"}

In that sense, it seems to me like the first person would inevitably die, in some sense, at the moment of teleportation (unless both copies of the person were kept).\n\nNow I know almost none or none of the cells of my body are the ones that were originally there, but this seems somehow different.\nTL;DR:"}

So we cut off communication.  A year or so later, we began to talk more and more and began a relationship about 7 months ago. \n\nNow we live together and we have been through and lived through a lot of obsticles (I've seen him cry multiple times and hes been going through family issues and ive always stayed right by his side).

He states thay he loves her so much and all that good stuff, but i feel like he doesnt do all that he can. My daughter does have a difficult time accepting him but she loves him back(keep im mind her biological father is no longer involved and hasnt been for  a while).

He says these things yet hardly does anything to prove to me that s what he wants. I ask him to watch her and he makes a big deal about it almost every time.  Even on the nights i worked intil four thirty in the morning he refused to get up with her so i would get about 3 hours of sleep. This bothers me tremendously.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My friend (26 M) has been dating a woman (23 F) for around half a year. Why is it that some completely adapt a new personality to fit their SO and others remain the same?\nPOST: Once I got to college I realized I suddenly had a series of new friends who greatly alter their behavior around the girls they date. For example, say my friend in the title (26 M) is dating a woman (23 F). Those two individuals, myself, and several other mutual friends are hanging out. In this scenario he may (and does) decide to greatly opt out of conversations he would otherwise relish in. In many cases these aren't even controversial conversations, but perhaps something he has decided his significant other (SO) isn't interested in? Or something else? It's easy to ask \"Why would someone alter their behavior for their SO?\" but at this stage it seems more then that because he seems to be in auto-pilot when she is around AND there are other friends around.\n\nUltimately I am confused by this type of behavior and always have been. I'd like to hear the other side of things without asking either of them, for the purpose of understanding my friends and learning of course. In my own past experiences I either identified that I have enough in common with a woman that I don't have to hide my own behavior / avoid various topics, or I simply let it go. I definitely don't expect anyone to change their social habits for me (not saying 23 F does here necessarily). It seems like way too large of a task to censor myself the 30-90% of my free time I spend with the woman I'm dating. I mean  shouldn't I have enough in common to begin with where I feel there is no reason to do so?\n\nCan anyone refute what I am saying? Genuinely interested in someone with experience changing their own behavior for others. But to be clear I'm not talking about \"oh he never takes out the trash!\" and then he begins taking out the trash. I'm talking personality and social experiences.\n\nThanks\nTL;DR:"}

Everything has been great until last year when she suddenly cut off contact with one of our mutual friends (20/F). It was a strange situation, but there was never a confrontation and now there's kind of an animosity towards me whenever I hang out with mutual friend. I can tell she gets pissed at me because she won't talk to me whenever I'm with mutual friend (she can tell because I usually post on snapchat).\nI've never asked why she stopped talking to mutual friend because I fear it will put a strain on our friendship and possibly ruin it. However, in the past few months I've been constantly ignored and put on the back burner by best friend. She will go a whole day and ignore my messages, snapchats, and texts, and then continue the next day like everything is fine. She doesn't share personal information with me anymore. There was a time when she used to tell me everything. I still tell her everything. But now all of the conversations are one-sided. She's always offering me advice, never asking for it, etc. I think our friendship may be near the end, but I still value her as a person and I don't want to lose her.

We both emailed each other within a week to separate email accounts. We've since discovered that the feelings we had have done nothing but grown over the years. \n\nWe are about to give our relationship a second chance. She is getting out of the army in November of this year, I have been out several years now. She has been deployed 3 times as a flight medic. We don't speak about her deployments unless she initiates the conversation. She is very uncomfortable with that part of her life, and is always grateful that I \"was never deployed\". \n\nThe problem is, after we broke up, I stayed in and did 2 tours in Iraq, and one in Afghanistan as a Forward Observer. I have never told her this. She thinks I got out during our breakup. Every time my time in the Army has come up, I just sort of smile and nod and sympathize. Saying things like \"yeah I'm glad I got out before I had to experience what you went through\" etc. \n\nI do not want to start our new relationship carrying this. I feel it is unfair to both of us. I've pretty much accepted and worked through everything I had on my plate as far as wars are concerned. I am very worried telling her the truth will make her, I'm not sure how to word this. I guess make her feel less important to me, since it would put us on the same level? \n\nIt is a very sensitive topic for her in general, and the last thing I want to do is hurt her -or- start our new relationship with a lie.

I started chatting her up online a few months ago and we had some great talks, I'd always try to send her something funny, and she'd reply back with something awesome too. I was waiting for the right moment to ask her out when she told me about an awesome local pizza place she had recently gone to. Asked her if she wanted to go with me, she said yes but wanted ask our mutual male friend first. He couldn't go and she backed out, saying she wasn't comfortable with one-on-one situations like this, but wanted to go with our group of friends another time - I was (and am) totally fine with doing that.\n\nBut, here's where I think I messed up. I replied back saying yeah, no worries, I'm not that different, I'm trying to break out of my comfort zone (meaning that I haven't been on many one-on-one dates myself), but I think she took that differently and I got a very cold reply in return, just a \"yeah, sorry\", which is very unlike her, she's normally very chatty and friendly.\n\nThis happened last week and I felt like crap most of the weekend because even if my chance of going out with her is done (it likely could be), we share a lot of the same friends and I know I'll be seeing her soon and I don't want things to be awkward even just as friends. What do I do? Apologize for using a poor choice of words and making things weird? Do nothing? I really don't know.

As I got older, I finally realized that it was because my mom really didn't care for my aunts and grandmother or them for her. So they all got together more and we just saw them sporadically. An advantage of being an adult and now having social media is I have been in contact with everyone more on my own. I have always invited them to big events in my life; wedding, showers, graduations, holidays, etc. We had a great family get together last year and I thought I was finally \"equal.\" But I guess not.\n\nMy eldest cousin's daughter was married this weekend. And I was not invited. I heard about my parents not getting an invitation and that it was a \"mistake.\" Lots of apologies from aunt, cousin and bride. They finally got one late in the mail but didn't  end up going because it was so last minute that my dad couldn't get time off from work. I never received one so I thought that none of us cousins were getting one because it was a small wedding. Boy was I wrong. I started seeing pics of the wedding posted to social media Friday night, and I see all of my cousins there. It was a HUGE 400 person wedding in a big hall. I even saw a big family picture of how much my cousin loves her \"crazy family.\" Hell, even the part-time colleges of my cousin were there.\n\nNow I don't know what to do. Even though we weren't always together, I thought we were close and family. I've never felt like more of an outsider. I feel like this was all for naught.

I guess I never knew until just now how unwelcome or maybe even unwanted I am in the family.\nTL;DR:"}

I find myself becoming resentful.\nPOST: My husband is sweet, funny, intelligent, and caring. However, I find myself becoming increasingly resentful over his chronic unemployment. \n\nI know he is younger than me and not as advanced in his career as I am. However, it seems like he can't keep a job down for more than a couple of weeks because he refuses to lower his imaginary standards of what his job in a workplace should be. \n\nHe does vacuum and do the dishes once in a while. Otherwise he is playing games and not even applying to places. (Note: I have no problems with video games, I play them as well but in more moderation... not to mention its my job industry.) \n\nWe have had discussions on this topic before and it seems it takes me crying before he really does anything. This happens every single time. \n\nIt is really coming to a head now since my game studio went under and had massive layoffs. Now I do not have a job or income. I am applying to places (bunch of interviews etc) while he has nothing. I keep thinking \"whats wrong with him... I can do this, why can't he?\". Its eating horribly into my savings and putting me slowly into credit card debt in order to feed and house us. I probably have about 2-3 months left until I can't afford rent. I hope to have a job by then but its not guaranteed. Right now he isn't helping out with any of the bills and its driving me crazy. Its so much stress and he doesn't or refuses to understand it. \n\nAm I a bad wife to feel resentful in this situation? I don't know what to do in order to light a fire under his ass.....\nTL;DR:"}

We have fairly recently acquired a similarly tightly knit group of girls as friends that we include in a wide variety of activities. We engage in hiking, drinking, camping, and other group activities together, and always have a great time. \n\nThere is one girl in the group that I have started to grow quite fond of, we obviously have quite similar interests, sports and outdoors primarily. Ill call her Beth. (20yo/F)\n\nIts been ~2 years since my last serious relationship, but I have had several flings since. My big flaw is I always struggle with conversation with a girl that I am interested in and want to get the ball rolling. There have been several instances that have made me think that she has similar feelings towards me, but nothing overwhelming. \n\nBeth is very attractive, but I have never seen her with a guy or heard of her having a boyfriend, and the only guys that Ive seen her with on facebook pictures have been from prom. This makes it tough for me to get an idea on how she acts around a guy she's interested in. She seems to mostly just enjoy the company of her girlfriends and us guy friends. \n\nSo here are my questions. Any advice on starting a relationship in a group situation like this? Advice on getting the ball rolling conversation-wise? Any other ideas? Thank you reddit, you are great.\nTL;DR:"}

She's always been insecure and I felt that my actions showed how much I loved her but  I wasn't good enough.\n\nIt felt out of the blue when she said she was pursuing someone else but changed her mind a week later saying she wanted to work things out. Then changed her mind again and she's now with him. \n\nI've had so many different feelings about it.

Now he makes over six figures and I make ~$40k. We've lived together for a couple of years and we've always split things 50/50, in my opinion, sometimes to an extreme degree- arguing over a few dollars, keeping a mental checkbook of who's paid what, etc. \n\nWe're both quite frugal and have saved as much as we could, though I had about $25K of student loans to pay off which set me back. Today he made a windfall from the stock market and now has saved over 10x the amount that I have (14k to >150k). To be clear, it's not like I want him to pay for everything or buy me gifts, I guess I wish it'd just be somewhere between 50/50 and proportional to our income, maybe. My main issue is that he plans on quitting his job, travelling for a bit, and doing who knows what. He has so much more opportunity than me and this leaves our relationship in an odd place- with me feeling down on myself and insecure in the relationship. \n\nI can't tell if I'm being greedy or rational here. It's not like even if he picked up more of our expenses, that'd I'd still even be close to having the same opportunities and feeling more equal.\n\nHow to other couples handle this?

I felt the relationship growing more distant and decided to talk to her about it. She explained she has been acting \"weird\" because she still has feelings for her ex from 6 years ago (they are no longer on speaking terms). She then explained to me that she wanted us to take a few steps back so she could re-assess her feelings. I am all for it because she has a lot of family issues to deal with right now and I feel that me being around is only making things a bit more complicated. It's only been a week since the split and last night we met up with some friends. After the party she got a ride home from me and we fooled around for a bit (no sex). I told her that doing this probably is not the best thing for us right now because she still has not told me her feelings whether or not she has sorted them out. I know it's only been 5 months, we're both young and this won't be our last relationship. I'm just unsure how to proceed with this. All her friends are quite peeved at her for bringing up the ex thing and they think I should just eliminate her from my life.

The last time I had asked him was last weekend and again the answer was no. I still couldn't shake off my hunch though and looked at his phone as he was sleeping.

No one else expressed interest so I posted it online but the owner only wants to hire people with connections or if they worked in a similar restaurant. \n\nSince then two of my other friends have come to me asking for jobs and neither of them are hireable for those positions. One of them is currently an escort, and since the restaurant is frequented by politicians/celebrities/athletes it would be a very bad idea to hire her, and if the boss ever found out he would kill me. The other would actually make a great hostess but she doesn't fit the \"sexy\" requirement and since the owner makes the final decisions regarding new hires, he wouldn't allow it, even if I strongly recommended her.

I want to be with him forever, I know that, I just want to experience what it's like to be with someone else sexually. For some reason, I can't get it out of my head. And no, he's not bad in bed, we have a great sex life. What is wrong with me? It's not fair to him at all. He's always there for me, caring for me, loving me, he even saved my life last year.\n\nI brought up the idea of having a threesome and he said no, to guy or girl. He actually seemed disgusted at the idea. I know you're supposed to talk to your spouse about stuff like this, but I highly doubt he'd be happy to hear that I want to have sex with other guys. I think it would really hurt him if I told him. \n\nWhen I think of only being 60 years old and having only slept with one guy, I think I'd regret it. But at the same time, I can imagine a 60 year old me, single, really regretting throwing away a great relationship. I really don't know what to do. Is this something that will go away? I didn't have any of these thoughts until he started talking about marriage.\nTL;DR:"}

I just started working at a new company and was told that I was going to work on a team with only foreigners. I was really excited about this especially since I haven't hung out with other foreigners in so long. \n\nWhen meeting my team it turns out that there is only me and one other dude from the UK. Regardless, I was sure that me and him would get along and that I could spam him with dank memes throughout the day. I've been trying to get to know him and find some common interests between us but he isn't really giving much info. I've even tried seducing him with food, which he nibbled at silently in his cubicle.\n\nWhen I do manage to get him to speak, it is just so damn awkward. An example of this is the other day we got into a conversation about how we ended up in this country. He asked about me and I told him my story but when I asked about his he gave very brief answers. Like I asked why did he first come to this country he just said, \"school\" and then stared at me for like 4 minutes. This also makes our work more difficult because the bulk of what we do has to be discussed together and decisions made together.\n\nI've made a group of friends here that I hang out during lunch with so I am not desperate for a buddy. But, I really would like to be able to communicate and get along with this coworker without it being so awkward especially since our team (him and I) are placed in the very far corner of the office building away from everyone else.\n\nHow can I get my coworker to talk with me? How can I avoid those long minutes of him awkwardly staring at me? Is there really anything I could do or should I just give up on the dude?\nTL;DR:"}

In most cities, I'm staying with family or friends, but I don't know anybody in this city. My school listed my host, 60s F, as a possible place to stay during my time in this particular city. \n\nMy issue is that she is very nosey! When I come home she barrages me with questions about my day. Asks me who I was with, what I did, for how long, etc. She makes a note of what time I get up every day and what time I come home. She once said to me, \"So, it seems like you get up around 7 every morning,\" and she had nothing else to add to that statement. And she'll use this as a piece of conversation: \"So, you got home around 10 o'clock last night. You must have had fun! What'd you do?\"\n\nShe's had other students stay with her in the past and, apparently, they've had similar issues. I'm not sure how they resolved those.\n\nI get so annoyed with her and anxious that she'll make a comment about my schedule that I try to sneak in and out of the house. As soon as I come home, I go into my room so she won't bother me. She knows when I get up and get home, so she makes sure to always be in the kitchen when she knows I'll be using it, like for breakfast and dinner times. She's retired, so she has all day to use the kitchen, but chooses to use it when she knows I'll be home. \n\nMaybe this is a petty issue.

He is actively encouraging her to cheat on me, to have sex with him, because he does \"not care\" about me and the way I feel. It's tearing our relationship apart, to the extent where I gained only two hours sleep last night (Because I was too busy crying and shaking violently at what I found out..). Upon sex stories, he has wanked (fapped to you Americans) over her facebook profile picture, and apparently brushed his hand against her legs, thighs and arms \"accidentally\". \n\nHe's got me by the balls. A grasp so tight I can't shake it. He's reveling in the misery he's causing me. I can't stand not being able to protect my girlfriend, *protect myself*. He *claims* to feel bad about what he's doing, but I'm not too sure. He says he's going to keep trying to get her, he's already said that he doesn't want a relationship with her, just sex.\n\nI guess I'm asking for both my girlfriend and I, what do we do? Where do we go from here? He's putting doubt over our relationship, continually trying to break us up and it hurts.

I've been dating this girl for a few months, and she is the love of my life. I lost my virginity to her, and we both told each other we loved each other. I had chances to lose my virginity before, but I had been waiting until I really felt special about someone, so sex isn't exactly something casual to me. This is the happiest we've both been in a long time, and our relationship has been wonderful.\n\nHowever, I'm agnostic and she's Christian. Just last week, she went to a camp to help single mothers connect to Christ. I saw this coming a mile away honestly, but once she finally had service again and was coming back, she tells me we need to talk. She said she feels like she's been a bad Christian since shes been having premarital sex and she wants to stop. I wasn't too happy about this and it resulted in a fight. She said I need to respect this or we probably won't work out.\n\nNow the thing is, the sex was amazing and she was almost always horny. I loved this, and thought it was great because I feel like sex is an important part of a healthy relationship. So now I'm conflicted, because I really do love this girl so much, she means so much to me, but I don't feel like this is gonna be healthy for our relationship.\n\nI feel like maybe she just needs time to be less emotional about it since she just got back. Like I said, I was waiting till I felt special about someone before sex, so I don't think I have a very shallow attitude about it. And I think its too young to get married or anything that's just out of the question. But obviously this is a problem, how should I address it?\nTL;DR:"}

The second time we go out she introduces me to her new boyfriend who is nice and easy to get along with. We and some of his friends have a good time out (though we spent half of the night following her boyfriend around like sheep) I pointed out to her that I didn't like this and she although she was shocked she did try to stop following him around. \nThe last time I went out with her/them we went to a friend of her boyfriends house for pre drinks before going into town however she left me alone in the house with a bunch of strange guys who I didn't know while she went for a walk with the bf. I got mad and quietly asked her not to do it again. At this point I had a horrible migraine but tried to shake it off however about 12:30am I decided to go home because I felt I was bumming everyone out so I got a taxi home. Now everytime I ask if she is up for going out she says she is already going out with her bf and others and doesn't invite, fair enough. But she has done it 4 times now. I'm starting to think her new friends don't like me because I was ill the last time I was out with them. I'm trying to talk to her about it but she either puts off the convo or ignores me (on facebook) \n\nI'm starting to feel really insecure.\nTL;DR:"}

Anyways, on to the fuck up (which actually happened today believe it or not!)\n\nMe and my friends were walking through the corridor at school, when I smashed my hip on the frame of a door (a tiny fuck up within the bigger fuck up to come), me being the idiot I am, fell on the floor and started screaming like I'd been shot (overreacting but meh, it hurt ok!) my brother then told me to stand up, to which I replied 'I can't, I'm crippled now' in a loud voice. Little did I know that the lift (elevator to you Americans) that carries kids in wheelchairs up to the second floor of the school had just opened, and a kid in a wheelchair came scooting out. I kinda just stood up real quick and noped the fuck out from sheer awkwardness, but one of the carers gave me a death stare as I walked off. Needless to say it was slightly awkward.\nTL;DR:"}

Firstly, I know some of you guys will judge me negatively on that, but it was a lifestyle decision of wanting to travel long-term before getting settled and while still being young. Fortunately I have accumulated a decent amount of savings to keep me comfortable without having to work. But I do want to work as long as it won't interfere with my travels!\n\nI have taken an interest in becoming a medical coder because it is a job that can be done remotely from what I researched, something that isn't possible for accounting. It appears that you can do everything online from getting certified to actually working. This would be perfect for me!\n\nUnfortunately every job position I came across required experience. I don't have any experience in medical coding obviously, but one can argue that accounting is a more \"difficult\" job (I don't want to step on anyone's toes, but just saying from an outside view). But honestly this experience requirement has been a big discouragement to me because I want to stay abroad and continue travelling. \n\nSo for you medical coders out there, is there anyway around this \"experience requirement\" predicament? I am willing to work hard and I am sure I can get certified under 6 months. Any suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}

That can be good or bad. \n\n2.We randomly met up for the first time when she was on a business trip, her idea, and clicked pretty well. Long story short, we kept texting and texting, and somehow through a bit of weird chemistry (again weird because it's a bit insane how close our past relationships have been, how we both handled them, and how similar we our) we ended up with this pact of, if in 18 months we're both still single we're gonna try and date. It was her idea, unprompted. Basically, no strings attached if we're both still single on February 1 of 2018, we meet up for a weekend and then see what happens.*\n\n3.We're both into the idea of a good story, and I've been dating around - there are lots of single girls in Nashville.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [24F] am new to dating, I met someone [30M] who I suspect is now lying about seeing other people. Is this normal?\nPOST: Well, some background first : I am 24 years old (F) and I don't have any experience with dating or relationships. I've finished school this past year and started devoting more time to meeting new people and trying to be more sociable. I met someone (30/M), and found that we have a lot in common, we have similar interests and hobbies.. I liked his confidence and his sense of humor and we just \"clicked\". Around the time we met, I had to move temporarily but we kept in touch, mostly through texting (he never calls and because of that I just feel awkward calling him). So here is where things get confusing :\n\nI know that we are just getting to know each other, and that at this point there is no commitment. So, I know that it's okay if we see other people at this stage, and it doesn't bother me if he does. He recently and suddenly took a trip to a foreign country, and I had a hunch that he was going there to meet someone. He sent me pictures of his dinner and there was another plate of food on the other side of the table. I asked him if he was eating alone and he said yes. Since he took this trip (1 week ago) he would only text me early in the morning, and wouldn't reply to my texts during the day. I asked him if he met someone there and he denied, I suggested that he should meet someone to show him around town and he said that he doesn't want to.  \n\nIt doesn't bother me that he's there to meet someone or that he's seeing other people. What bothers me is that he is lying about it, I feel like he's patronizing me by lying when its so obvious (he's not going to be alone in another country for a week). Am I wrong in expecting brutal honesty from him? Is seeing other people at the beginning of the relationship some unspoken rule that we shouldn't be talking about or admitting to? and should I just give up on him?\nTL;DR:"}

I was walking my wife's two dogs through our neighborhood, as one does.  I didn't have any poop bags....actually, in the interest of full disclosure, I haven't picked up dog poop in about 5 years because I usually walk them when it's dark and nobody will notice and because I'm clearly a terrible human being.  Well, last night it was daylight and one of the dogs was inconsiderate enough to squat and poop in full view of a family having dinner just on the other side of a bay window.  Two hispanic women...one middle aged and one elderly started to point and were clearly angry.   I pulled the dogs along and sped up, crossed the street, and only felt mildly guilty.  A couple minutes later, a car pulls up beside me, rolls down the window, and starts pointing at the dog who pooped and yelling.  It was the middle aged hispanic woman.  The yelling wasn't all in English, but I clearly understood when she told me to go back and get the poop or she was calling the police. She also said she'd taken pictures of me. Uhh ok.  So I took the walk of shame back to her yard, stole the plastic off some poor soul's newspaper, and picked up the poop...all while the elderly angry woman stared at me through the window, pointing and mouthing what I can only imagine were terrifying threats and insults.  I really hope they don't know where I live.  So lesson learned....from now on, make my wife walk her own damn dogs.\nTL;DR:"}

In the end though, we always understand each other. I wouldn't trade it for the world. \n\nMy boyfriend almost broke up with me a few days ago. This was a culmination of his low self esteem. He thinks I can do a lot better and that breaking up with me would be an ultimate expression of his love. He thinks he's not good enough for me and that he treats me terribly. This is not true. He's fucked up a few times when we were young teens but never cheated on me, or abused me, or anything like that. He has a bit of a problem not thinking before he speaks sometimes, but I know that! It's just his flaw and I really don't mind it. If we fight over it, we always resolve it quickly. \n\nThere's no reason for him to feel like I can do better. He even cooks and cleans most of the time so I don't have to stress about it (he works little hours a week and I'm in a stem degree), which imo is TOO kind but he insists. I'm so grateful to him and the joy he brought to my life. I'm getting really worried because while our relationship seems better I'm wondering if he wouldn't be happier without me, and maybe I should just end it for his sake? He seemed really serious but couldn't go through with walking out while I was crying even though I was holding back and trying to let him decide what he wanted.\nTL;DR:"}

I entered the bathroom and I immediately purged the junk food out from my bowels in a mighty explosion. I managed to retain most of it by pulling my shorts against my legs to create a seal, but I still dripped shit on the floor. I waddled over to the toilet and pretty much had the equivalent of an intestinal exorcism occur in me.

After a 20 minute shower with Hibiclens (hospital strength disinfectant, I used to wrestle so it was required to use it) I made sure to wipe down the shower with it too and grab some fresh clothes.

She gets accepted into Grad School up north and we talk and talk and eventually decide maybe we should take some time apart and see what happens. About a month after she leaves we start talking again and decide we want to work together toward a new and healthy relationship together.  We both love each other and want to wind up together eventually.  So we enter a Long distance relationship at this point. We have our sad times of missing one another but it goes on for about a year and a half of phone calls and visits  until about last week (So we were long distance for about 1.5 years). I get a phone call from her telling me Hi and that she needs to tell me something.  She feels horrible but she has been in another relationship for the last 9 months without telling me. She still tells me she wants a future with me but is unwilling to end her \"new\" relationship up there. In our talks during those 1.5 years of her up there we were close and intimate (special phone time) and this really came from left field. She tells me she wanted to tell be but didn't want to hurt our chances for our future. Honestly I am pretty hurt and confused.  We've talked a bit since that and she has told me she is sorry repeatedly and that if she could she would of told me sooner.  But still says she loves me and would want a future with me when she is done with school. I do love her. But how do you trust someone after that? \n\nAnyone got some advice? Thanks for your time.\nTL;DR:"}

This doesn't change anything to me, I still love her the same as before but I think knowing your partner's sexuality and preferences is important.

And realistically both me and my girlfriend are aware that nudes she may have sent to an ex may have been posted online, in todays day and age its more than possible..but anyways, he told her that he \"did her a favor\" and took them down (sure) and so he'd like her to do him a favor, then he proceeded to say a bunch of disgusting shit to her, of course she hung up but he wont stop calling, over and over and over again, she picked up one more time to tell him off and he told her that he knows where she lives. \n\nSo my girlfriend called me from a landline and i told her to call virgin mobile (she has an iPhone) customer service in the morning to they could block the number (obvious thing to do) but as for notifying the police, how would something like that be done? just call them? go to a station? what would she have to say to them and what would even be done? We live in Canada, Ontario.\n\nI am furious that someone would do this to the girl I love and I want to make sure she's safe and has peace of mine, i've never considered what to do in this kind of situation so any insight would be much appreciated guys.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been lucky enough to be a homeowner since I moved out a few years ago. As a way to make some spare money, I decided to rent out my spare bedroom to a good friend of mine, who we'll call Taylor. This is her first time out of the house, and I can tell both her, and her parents are a little apprehensive about her daughter moving out.Taylor has been living here for a little less than two weeks, and I'm impressed with her, considering she's always lived at home.   \n\nMy question is, I have no clue how to act, what to do, and how much to play it up. How much of the house do I show them? I'm a clean freak, so I know everything will look tidy.\n\nI guess in a lot of ways, I'm just looking for any advice. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

We've only hung out around 3 times in that time span. Yesterday Chelsea, another friend (Cindy), and I were hanging out with them, left to go to the bars, and went back to hang out with them (semi) drunk.\n\nThey drove us to dinner and the girls sat in one side of the booth (me in the middle) while the guys sat on the other side. I'm in the middle of telling a story when all of a sudden I feel a tap, tap, tap on my foot. \n\nI stop talking (probably looking bewildered), it stops, so I continue and then there's another tap, tap, tap. I was still somewhat drunk still and so the tapping made it difficult for me to focus so I said something like: \"I swear I'm gonna punch someone in the face\". Then I was able to finish talking but I kept feeling one of the guys tapping on my feet on and off pretty much up until we got our food. \n\nBoth guys are pretty jokey and one of them likes to poke fun at me a lot (and pranked me pretty hard earlier in the day; I'm also known to be an easy target with pranks/ too trusting/ really gullible). I guess I'm just not sure if this was a continuation of the prank or if one of them was trying to flirt with me?\nTL;DR:"}

Her boyfriend who sometimes lives with her might have access to the key but I'm not sure. He thinks I'm going to get robbed or worse and couldn't believe my mom \"lets (me) live here\". I told him not to worry about it because I've never had a problem but today he replaced the entire front door and locks and said if my landlady comes back to the US and has a problem with it he'll take care of it.

I've been with my boyfriend for a little over a year now, and things are normally amazing. He is the most sensitive, loving boyfriend I've ever had, and I feel lucky to have him. Until we argue. \n\nWhenever we argue, he immediately gets defensive, and attacks me for my side of the argument. Big issue or small, his response is always the same \"I can't believe you're saying this to me,\" or \"I can't believe I just heard/read that.\" Even when I try to tactfully maintain the argument to a simple discussion level (instead of full-blown yelling), in the face of him accusing me of outrageous things (going behind his back, taking other people's sides, etc.), he still attempts to turn the argument and attack me for bringing something up with him. He accuses me of things that don't make sense, like knowing more information than I'm letting on, or trying to actually start the fight. I hate drinking with him because it just makes it worse.\n\nOur fights end in one of two ways; he either walks away, or I concede and roll over and apologize for even bringing anything up.\n\nBut, any other time in our relationship, he is the perfect, model boyfriend. I don't get it! How can he flip-flop so quickly to being so defensive and aggressive with me? I don't understand him and I don't know what to do anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

I totally understand why we broke up.\nSome back story: she was my best friend and we were together for almost 6 years. The first few years was a dream come true. We were both really happy with each other and comfortable with each other. We've been arguing A LOT the last couple of years and it was always because I started it. She's not a very affectionate person and I get so insecure when she hangs out with her friends and don't pay attention to me. Finally this past weekend she told me she can't handle it anymore and she needs to be away from me. She can't be with someone who is fueled by bitterness, jealousy, and negativity. I love her and to be honest she'll be happier without me in her life right now. But I need her. I know I can change back to be the person I was before all the insecurity, the person she fell in love with before. After the break up, we agreed to stay as friends and we can revisit our life in a few months to see if we really need each, and if we do we can get back together. I don't want to wait a few months. We are going to go dinner tomorrow and I plan to just be her friend and not pressure her to get back together. Be the positive person I used to be for her and just hope she'll fall in love with me again. Some of my friends think it's the dumbest idea ever for my goal to be to get her back and we broke up for a reason. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

While the relationship wasnt perfect, it alerted me to what I want out of a relationship like marriage, a family, and someone who will be as happy melding with my family as I will be with his. All I can think of lately is that I missed my chance to meet the right person since leaving school. I'm an elementary school teacher so meeting a guy that's around my age and single at work is slim. I've joined meetup groups for when I finally move but am scared that it's too late. I know MANY people in my family and out of it that have become single at 24 and then never met someone to share their life with.

She's super cute, cool, fun to be around, etc. but I think we have very wide ranges in sexual experience. I really like hanging out with her and this morning she sent me a (huge) text and I'm not sure what to make of it.\n\nThe first night we went out we got drinks (and more drinks and more drinks). It stormed, and we were around the corner from my place, so I invited her in. We were both pretty hammered and ended up naked in my bed. Nothing happened, we just made out but organs were in the right places and we almost had sex (we didn't, there was no penetration and apart from one second of manual/hand stimulation on each other there was no sexual activity). \n\nThis morning, after our third date last night, she sent me a 10-paragraph text message about how she'd like to take things slow, not set expectations sexually, etc. She said she's slow to have sex with someone until she's serious and that she doesn't do casual sex (which is fine). \n\nI told her all that's fine with me (it is) and that I don't have any preconceived expectations but I don't know if she's talking about any kind of stimulation or if she's talking about PIV sex. \n\nI'm not looking to have a relationship in which we don't share any physical intimacy but I would be ok not having sex. Is it okay to clarify what she means or does that come across as pushy / too focused on physical intimacy? \n\nShe said if I'm not okay with 'pumping the brakes a little' that we should probably not see each other again. I'm totally fine with not having sex but when I think of what I want from dating and shared experiences physical intimacy (not necessarily PIV sex) is a part of that.\nTL;DR:"}

Today as I was walking past him he stretched his hand out to me in an attempt to touch my hair which was done in a bun today. He made some comment about my bun which I can't even remember. He then pops up on my floor later in the afternoon while I'm at my desk and surprises (and scares me) when he reaches out his arm again says \"Come on, let me touch your bun,\" in a playful manner. I said no and he walks away, but that still left me feeling very uncomfortable.\n\nAm I being harassed? This is the first time he's done something this forward with me. Usually I walk past him every morning, say hello and keep it moving, but I feel like he is always attempting to talk to me or get my attention and this so far is his most direct approach, which caught me off guard.\n\nAm I overreacting? If not, should I report this and what can I expect to happen if I report?

I shit my pants while riding through busy traffic, so my only thought at this point is to head back to the hotel, so i get there, pull up outside and there's some kind of presentation going on involving the Japs, i have no option at this point, it's running down my leg, my cream chino's are fuckin ruined beyond repair and sporting a huge brown stain down the back, my only option is to try and leg it through reception into the lift. Easier said than done, its fucking packed in the reception area, so i try my best, make it to the lift, get inside hit my floor button and the door close button! Luckily someone was looking down on me that night, and the door's closed. Got back to my room only to discover the horror that was trailing from the lift doors to my room!

My parents and I are taking care of my sister's dog for a year. He (the dog) is a small poodle/shih tzu/something mix, around 7 years old. My sister has been extremely lenient/lacking in ability to be the one in command with the dog and he has some very bad habits as a result, ie. horrible leash etiquette, ignores us when he is called/general commands, and, the biggest problem thus far, occasionally running away.\n\nSince his arrival (3 weeks ago) he has had a tendency to stick around and generally display good behaviour for several days straight before, out of nowhere, will run off on an adventure. This has happened perhaps 3 or 4 times in his time here and he's made it very clear that he KNOWS he's not supposed to run off (i went to look for him in a vehicle and when he saw it was me he instantly turned around and ran home full tilt), yet continues to do so. It's incredibly worrying..\n\nThe dog is fairly familiar with our house and the surrounding area due to past visits. This is the sort of place where it's calm and quiet enough to walk one's dog without a leash, but I've taken to putting him on the leash whenever we leave the property (fenced one acre) as to sort of set 'home boundaries'. I also try to go for even a short walk once a day to keep his energy from flaring up and being expressed in wild doggy adventures and that seems to help.\n\nhowever! We are not able to constantly keep an eye on him. We don't want to keep him inside all the time but nor do we want to keep him on a leash outside. We're not certain how to impress upon him that it is specifically running away that he is not supposed to do. What should we do the next time he runs away to show him that it's bad? What are things that we can do in the meantime to discourage this behaviour?\nTL;DR:"}

Second, this is my first post here and I know the general rules here but if I overlooked something or have been vague please tell me and I will edit it. Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been riddled with fights with our time together. We do fight alot but we always make up the day after. My GF and I are our first and we know that we're not really sure how relationship works but we know that there would always be fights. \n\nWe do things together and we enjoy them. We enjoy each other's company and we love each other very much. I do what I can for her and she does the same. I bring her a jacket for her class and I carry her books for her when I can. I try to be a good man when I'm with her.\n\nHowever, it seems that everything I do for her would always be criticized. For example, during our pregnancy scare, I asked other people's opinion (people who are more experienced than us) because we were so worried and I didn't want her to worry. When she found out, she got really mad and got really jealous of my friends. Next, she criticized how I was masturbating and was also jealous of me fapping to pornstars (wtf.). Now, I followed her advice and apparently I did that wrong too. It's like I don't do things for her.\nTL;DR:"}

I've known the girl I am seeing right now for 8 months and she is amazing: cute, funny, nerdy, smart etc etc but I have problems of my own: I just can't put my feelings into a relationship. \n\nI cared and really really liked her at first, but now it almost seems like texting her is a *drag*. I'll pretend to go to sleep because I don't want to text and just enjoy my time. But it's not just her, I personally *loathe* texting people all the time. But when I go home to see her (long-distance relationship), I just don't have it in me. I'm tired and would rather see friends i've know my whole life than see her. \n\nThis problem has happened to me numerous times: I will really like a girl, treat her right and get to the relationship point, but then I lose all interest. Like absolutely all. In fact, all I really want is to be able to spend time as I choose and not *feel obligated to text and hangout with her*. This feeling of forced hanging out (even if it is once every 2 weeks) is getting me down, and it just doesn't feel right. \n\nIs there something wrong with me? Cause there's nothing wrong with these girls and I feel extremely guilty, as though i'm consciously playing with them for no reason. I just want to be able to spend my time and feelings as I choose, and not be obligated into anything. And it's really complicated because we have many mutual friends and I just don't feel the same way she does when she tells me her feelings.\nTL;DR:"}

Being a young idiot i somehow thought hey it would be a great idea to ask her out...but not the simple way of asking someone out but something special. I told her i had something special for her tomorrow and would suprice her like a motherfucker and it came from a loving place she said \"wow awesome i can't wait\" with a cute smile. While walking home that day with a few good mates i started asking them how somebody should ask a girl out none of them had any good ideas. So i reached home and proceeded to ask my mum how my dad asked her out (my mum didn't know i was talking about dating a girl not marriage) so my mum told me my dad knelt on his knees and gave her a ring. In my head i saw that as being perfect i decided to look for a gold ring which concluded in me ransacking my mums room looking for the perfect ring which i found. I placed the ring in my bag with a large smile around my mouth as i couldn't wait for the big day.\n\n So it's school and i kept waiting for the perfect moment, our class left for an early recess which seemed to be the perfect moment. I removed the ring out of my bag and called out her name, she looked behind with a smile and said \"oh yeah what did you want to show me?\" I knelt on one knee and said (lets call her Susan) \"Dear susan will you be my girlfriend\" (at that moment everyone was coming out of class and my whole class was watching this). Susan looked at me then looked at everyone then picked up the ring and threw it saying i don't like boys i like girls.

We have a child and we share custody. He is supposed to pick her up after work. He changes his schedule (willingly) almost every 2 weeks. I work overnight. I am currently in a temporary supervisor position, giving me access to the whole departments schedules. Depending on when he comes to work, I either pick her up one of two places when I get off at 630am. To be sure of the location of pickup, I checked his schedule in the middle of the night while working. It said 7a-330p, so I assumed it would be pickup from Point A. I waited until almost 7 am, and decided to go to Point B thinking he must not be going to work until 8a. When it comes time for him to pick her up, I text him to ask when he is coming. He says 5pm, that his schedule is 8-5, and asks why. I said just checking, because your schedule said 7-330. He is legally obligated to give me his schedule in advance, but rarely gives me more than 12 hours notice. I assumed he either didn't realize what his schedule was, or he was lying.\n\nNow, I am in the temporary supervisor position, applying for the full time position. I had already gone through several interviews and I was to have a meeting/interview with the big boss that night about it. Instead, when I get to work, he has a printed off email of this text conversation and tells me that I was wrong to look it up and that I am being denied the position for this reason. I believe my ex is doing this to be malicious towards me and prevent me from getting the position. Otherwise, why would he make such a big deal of it, if not just out of anger for being caught.

A lot of romantic tension had been building up between us and he asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship with him. I said yes! One thing led to another and we decided to take a bath together because that sounded like a cute thing to do. My bathroom is small and poorly ventilated, it has one small window which was closed. We are both pretty shy and don't have much experience in the way of sex so we fooled around a little and it was kind of an adorably awkward experience but we were both pretty nervous to be doing it at all. After a while, we decided to turn the shower on with some cool water because it was getting way too hot. When we stood up, we continued fooling around and then the next thing I know, I am on the bathroom floor with my ears ringing and he is panicked, yelling and asking if I am okay and if I need an ambulance (keep in mind throughout this whole ordeal we are both naked and dripping wet). I, at least, am mortified that my first even remotely sexual experience ended in me, unconscious on the bathroom floor. Today I painfully learned the importance of opening a window in a poorly ventilated bathroom during a hot bath/shower.\nTL;DR:"}

It's been great, he's sweet and kind, everything has been going smoothly and we've steadily been getting closer as time goes on. We both live in our own places, and have been seeing more and more of each other. We started sleeping together around Halloween, and I lost my virginity to him (which he knows).\n\nWe did establish right away that he didn't want a serious relationship, but that we were exclusive. I've been totally fine with this, though I am open to a relationship if that were to happen.\n\nSo last night we were laying in bed, post coitus, just talking and relaxing. The subject got on to my best friend and roommate [F20], and he said \"she is just the cutest girl, so cute, her [positive trait 1] and her [positive trait 2], you just want to take care of her.\" I immediately was taken aback and felt like crying. It was just the worst time to say something like that. I didn't say anything, just sort of agreed and changed the subject.\n\nThis totally messed up my day today, I couldn't focus on work, and found that I started comparing my every trait with hers, and feeling resentment. I feel absolutely ridiculous that I'm feeling these things, but I am. I'm also not sure what to think since later that same night he was telling me about how he told his friends more about me and how great I am. It was a very weird compliment sandwich.\n\nIs this something I should worry about, or talk to him about? Do guys generally find a girl to be annoying or needy for bringing up something like this? Should we have a conversation about our relationship status?\nTL;DR:"}

We have TWO fridges and they are both completely full of leftovers and ice cream and all kinds of junk. The day after I told her my diet plans she cooked chocolate chip pancakes and my dad ordered pizza for dinner. She literally brings food to me every hour or so that I'm at home. My mom is a nurse so she's always telling me I'll be healthy if I just eat what she gives me but if I did that it would add up to about 3000 kcal per day and I'm trying to eat half that! She gets angry when I refuse food and when I asked her if I could cook for myself she just ignored me. \nMy dad is also trying to lose weight but he eats whatever my mom makes and hasn't been successful. He never cooks, but on the weekends he always goes out for lunch, so my sisters and I usually do too. He doesn't have a plan and isn't really committed to it. \nI've lost 10 pounds (170 to 160) so far but it's been so hard and my mom has not been supportive at all despite her initial approval. My dad is proud of me and has gotten better about buying food for me (he will call and ask if I want anything instead of just assuming I do). \nWhat can I do to make this easier? I know it's not supposed to be easy but when my family was gone on vacation for a week (I couldn't go) it was SO much easier to eat less! Without my mom shoving food in my face constantly I ate a reasonable amount. I cooked and shopped for myself and it was the best week for my weight loss so far. How do I convince my parents, mom especially, to let me cook for myself? Or at least not give me all of the food she cooks.\nTL;DR:"}

My sister said he was so stupid about it that people in her class made fun of her about it and it was a common knowledge thing(Smallish town).\n\nGrowing up I was upset over my parents divorcing, and when I learned why later from sis, I grew to resent him. He did stay a part of our lives and as far as I know he helped us financially, but what it did to my mom is what really gets me upset. She slipped into depression over it, as she had loved him so much, and has never moved on. I don't think she has been on a date since the divorce. I asked her not too long ago why she never dated and she said cheating is an inevitability and she didn't want to go through it again, better the pain of being alone than betrayed.\n\nAnyways, dad remarried twice over the last 13 years, and low and behold cheated on both of those wives and is now divorced and alone. Back in March he got into an accident that has him in a wheelchair for months, or so he told us, and he needs someone to help take care of him over the next months.\n\nMy sister has flat out refused, she won't hardly talk to him. I do talk to him, but as a formality, I've never felt many positive things for him. He's asked me to do this since I am out in a week for summer break, but I just find myself getting angry over the thought of him asking this after what he's put me through.\n\nAnother part of me is saying it is wrong to deny helping family, but I am just so mixed here.

She normally does most of the cleaning (I deal with non-delicates laundry, litter box, dishes, Roomba care, and general pickup.  She does surface cleaning in bathrooms and kitchen, additional vacuuming, dusting, mopping.).  But the weird thing I noticed this week while she was gone was that there wasn't a lot that needed done.  There wasn't a whole lot of laundry (she has work clothes, and casual clothes, and pajamas every day), fewer dishes (I ate like a bachelor and produced nothing that couldn't go into the dishwasher), the Roomba did a decent job with the floor (because it wasn't eating all the socks she leaves everywhere), and I didn't have to pick up all the things she leaves around the house.\n\nI hate that she spends so much time cleaning all the time, plus I don't like all the cleaners she uses.  I also feel awkward when she's cleaning when I just want to relax, but I realize it's her standard that she's keeping up with and she generally doesn't bother me about it.\n\nThe real problem is that she gets stressed out if things are messy (for her standards, so all the sheets on all the beds need to be washed, floors mopped, everything dusted, nice things set out, all the towels and napkins washed, etc.), especially if we're having guests and will marathon for 8 hours and stay up until very late until everything is done.  Any advice on getting her to reduce the production end of the equation instead of increasing the cleaning side of the equation?  Or how to get her to calm down about worrying about being judged by guests?\nTL;DR:"}

I would also tear up extremely easily if someone hurt my feelings. We're talking crying all the frigging time here. It may be worth mentioning that my dad always told me to stop being a sook anytime I got upset.

Somewhere in the conversation he mentioned how it was the hottest thing he'd ever done and how they owed each other a squirt... I was so taken aback because we'd had several conversations about threesomes and never did he mention his.

I've always been very independent and have never imagined a future where I am being supported by someone else. My relationship with my family is neither close or negative. We keep our personal lives to ourselves and that is just what is normal for us.\n\nMy GF: She is currently living with parents, rent free, utility free, food available and ready when she comes home from her full-time work. I don't think she makes enough to completely support herself and is taking classes. She has a VERY LOVING and HEALTHY relationship with her parents. The complete opposite of mine and she is very lucky to have that.\n\nShe is not a dead-beat who leaches off her parents. She works very hard and has legitimate reasons (wage not enough and goes to school) to still live at home.\n\nBUT, even with all that, I still feel bothered. She doesn't need to pay rent/insurance/bills, everything goes to her and her social life. I've suggested to her to switch PT work and focus on school so she can finish faster but she says doesn't want to. By the time she finishes her degree and is able to START her actual career, she will be into her 30's.\n\nWhen I asked about her living situation, she says she doesn't need to move out and doesn't plan to anytime soon. I feel that she is too comfortable with her situation right now and takes for granted that time is a resource that you can't get back. I come over often since I live far away for my job and she still lives in my hometown. That means I stay over quite often at her parents house which makes me feel like I am overstaying my welcome (traditional asian parents)\n\nI feel like an ass because she has legitimate reasons to stay, but I just can't get over that feeling.\n\nAm I just over-reacting?\nTL;DR:"}

I love her and she loves me but there is something which I struggle with. We don't get a fight often but when we do, it's a real pain in the ass for me because I believe she is manipulative. Whenever there is a disagreement, she likes to be the victim. She will say things along the lines of: \"oh there you have it, it's 100% my fault\", \"yeah should I make a list of everything that is wrong with me while we're at it?\" and \"it's so tiring to argue with you\".\n\nI have no idea how to react if she says something like that. Up to now, it has always ended in me eventually apologizing to her and I don't think it's the righteous thing to do because it will actually provoke her in engaging in this manipulative behaviour again. \n\nI know this isn't front-page worthy but all I ask is some advice on how to deal with this, so I'm able to at least argue normally, once it's neccessary . She doesn't threathen with breaking up or anything, but the repeative manipulative behaviour of hers may actually make me want to break up myself, and I want to avoid that if it's possible.\nTL;DR:"}

The bartender does not stop though and continues to keep pushing me for another 25 feet.  Other bartenders see this and assume I was trying to fight someone so theys start circling around.  I've had enough at this point and push away the bartenders arms and make a speedy escape up the stairs to the streets.  \nThey did not stop their though and continued to follow me with 6 big bartenders threatening to kick my ass on the streets.  So I did what any body would do at that point.  I started kicking my legs left and right like it was a hoe down and put my fists up like I was a Irish boxer.\nThis strategy eventually worked but I think it's outrageous the power that bartenders have.

Questions like does your tongue ever get white stuff of it? Her most recent worry was that she had some broken blood vessels on her arm from scratching, and her anxiety stopped her from coming out to the lake with us for the day. She has worked herself up because she burnt the inside of her mouth and thought it was cancer because it hurt a few days after. I really want to help her but she seems to not want to help herself.\n\nMy mom is a registered counselor, and I've offered to my friend that she could see my mom free of charge, and she seemed up for it, but now she's avoiding me completely. She says that she can fix it herself but it's only getting worse.\n\nI guess my question is, how can I be supportive when she doesn't want to get help? How can I stop myself from getting frustrated when she won't take advice? I guess I just need help, because I really want to help her to get better so she can enjoy being a 20-year old, healthy, beautiful girl.\nTL;DR:"}

However, they didn't change the values of classes we had already taken, which probably has something to do with current accreditation or something.\n\nMy problem stems from this, as a class I took freshman year for electrical engineering was only worth 3 credits as opposed to the 4 it would be worth now. This means that I (as well as 2 other electrical engineers) am now short 1 credit to graduate for my major, so I need to take a 2 credit directed study, which isn't too much of a problem. However, this puts me at 20 credits, which means they charge an \"overload fee\" (aka their way to attempt to keep people at the school and paying tuition longer). However, I need all 20 credits to graduate (and no, I did not slack off or fail any classes before. I took a full class load each semester, and any more classes would have given me the overload fee.) My adviser saw this and informed me that I wouldn't be charged due to their error, but I just received an email from the registrar's office saying I would.

After he left I've probably spent about a month with him total in the 14 years he was gone. I never really got to know him, I just always knew he was my dad.

We had sex about 4x a week for years and have always been satisfied with each other despite our fluctuations in weight. \n   Lately I have been focusing all my strength on recovering from my panic and anxiety by seeing therapists, psychiatrists, reading self help books, posting on forums, taking medications etc. Its been a very difficult past 3 months.

I know that everyone is different and that there are no rule books for bipolar.  But I am just wondering if anyone else has experience here.  Maybe this isn't even a result of the bipolar, but I think it is based on our conversations around it.  \n\nI really like her and want to be supportive and really give this a good chance, but things seem so difficult for a fairly new relationship.  Has anyone else experienced this behavior?  Can it get better, or can I expect this cyclical hot and cold behavior to endure?  How do you cope with these swings in your own relationship?  She is medicated by the way, and is treating it.\nTL;DR:"}

Apparently 5 inches high on a country property in AUS is TOO LONG.\n\nIt was 40 degrees celcius and I was sweating like crazy. I immediately tried to argue this 'order' from the dragon to which I received: \"Mow the fucking lawns!\" Righto bitch-tits, let me die in the heat then.\nSo away I went, filled up the ride-on mower with petrol, checked the oil, chucked on my ipod with mufflers over the top to protect my little ears.\n\nWell I thought I broke the Australian speed mowing record that day, riding the mower up towards the house, all I could think about was how good a job I had done.\n\nLittle did I know that I was heading for a new garden bed that had been put in between the house and me. Well I just drove straight over this wood and steel built side of the garden, obliterated the new plants, and bent the blades to shit. The blades went up through the motor belt and chassis of the mower, then broke off and straight into the motor.\n\nThis was not a good move, as my dad and stepmum saw the whole thing. \nThe next thing I remember was the mower catching on fire, dad running to get the fire extinguisher and my stepmum screaming: \" YOU FUCKING IDIOT, YOU ARE THE WORST FUCKING CHILD ON THE EARTH\".\n\nI got grounded for like a year, and basically verbally abused for the next month about how much of a disgusting piece of shit I was.\nTL;DR:"}

(Pic inside)\nPOST: New Years Eve in Las Vegas 2011-12, my brother and I had come across some 'Free Hugs' signs. Thinking it was a great way to meet some girls we immediately started using them. We quickly learned it wasn't only a great way to meet girls but to make everyone smile. We hugged girls, guys, old, young, blacks, whites, gay, straight, drunks, cops and even a police horse got in on it. \n\nWe hugged so many people I've forgotten what most of them looked like because it was usually a quick interaction (alcohol may also be to blame) but there is one girl I won't quickly forget. This younger girl, maybe 20-23 walks by and has a look of complete depression on her face. Not sure if she's just received terrible news, has to work on NYE or what. I say to her \"free hugs, no one's exclude. Come and get it\" She kinda slows down and turns around. \"They're free! No strings attached\" I say. She gets a small smirk. \"Start the New Year off right\" I try one more time. She then walks towards me, smile starting to emerge. \"There you go\" I say as she embraces me tighter than I have even hugged girlfriends. She holds it for what seemed like 20 minutes but it was closer to 2. As she let's go she quietly says \"Thank you so much\" with what looked like tears of joy/happiness/relief about to burst out of her eyes. She walked away into the madness that was the Vegas Strip. This interaction completely took me by surprise and changed that night for me and hopefully for her. I don't think I'll ever forget that amazing moment I shared with a complete stranger.\nTL;DR:"}

We're both in our early 20's and have been going out a few months (I'm female). I'm worried he's gay or uninterested. \n\n-Basically all his friends are girls. I met him through a mutual friend who is female. I don't think he's against having guy friends, he has before but anyone I see him interact or hang out with is a girl aside from boyfriends they may have.\n\n-He never initiates sex. He did once (the first attempt) but we were drunk, after that it's always been me. He's never on top and sometimes it's tough for him to get hard. First I thought he was just nervous but now I feel like he should be comfortable enough with me.\n\n-I knew him for a while before and I've never heard him talk about or show any interest in girls.\n\n-He's not girly but not really masculine either.\n\n-He can have a really \"bitchy\" attitude. He'll snap at me really easily, which really has nothing to do with being gay but no guys really ever talked to me like that. He has that attitude towards everyone.\n\nHe doesn't show an interest in men or women really. Which I thought was good since we're dating but it just seems weird he never did before either. He has had previous girlfriends but I don't know much about that.  The girl friends he has really do seem like just friends, nothing more. But between that, the sex thing and everything else I'm really starting to get worried.\n\nHe may just not like me much but other than the snapping at me he's generally nice. But maybe he just thinks of me like another friend and likes hanging out with me with the benefit of a cover up? I feel bad jumping to this conclusion but it doesn't seem really out of the question.\n\nSo two questions. What do you think the chances of him being gay are and just how horribly will this go if I try and ask him? I have no clue what to do about this\nTL;DR:"}

I got in, took it away immediately and said he just lost it.\n\nIn the past he's shown excessive consumption behavior with Helium. Going beyond just changing his voice, he \"drank\" a balloon once and got so light headed he fell down. (got right back up btw)\n\nAlso lately he's been acting out on the school bus by apparently saying he's \"high on weed\" (I smoke but keep it hidden)(we are closely monitoring this too), as well as pretending he's drunk on occasion.  \n\nFor the record: he's not actually getting any weed, alcohol or anything of that nature.

It makes him feel that I deserve a lot better.\n\nThe problem is, i do love him. Yet i remember these things and my confidence in how he feels for me lessens.

He asked to meet up for lunch and while we had fun and thought it was gentlemanly of him to not be physical, it didn't occur to me that he has a girlfriend. Looking back, there weren't any opportunities to ask if he was seeing someone and I just assumed that he was single (lesson: that's a very BAD ASSUMPTION).\n\nA mutual friend of the girlfriend told me that he is in a relationship, which might explain why he wouldn't accept me on social media.

He keeps asking questions which give the impression that we will hang out soon but it never comes. I've already decided not to reach out to him first but surprisingly, he still drops a message. \n\nThe fact that he didn't even try to name drop The Girlfriend makes it suspicious. I don't know if I should confront him/find a way to let him bring it up, but I don't know how.

I don't want my girlfriend (F18) or I to be recognized through my regular username. My girlfriend of seven months and I are going through what appears to be a small dilemma, but I want other perspectives. She is currently attending an art school (we are both in college). She was asked by a friend to nude model for an art project, she has done this once before while we were dating and I was alright with it then, and I was alright with it this time as well. My only concern was that a friend of her's (a male) would be there. He is a friend of mine as well. She assured me that he wouldn't be there, so I didnt care that she was doing this. So she went to the modeling session, which lasted only a short time but while the session was rapping up the friend (who I didn't want to be there) walked into the room. I was not present by the way. He saw her naked, but only for a short time. This would have upset me a bit, but the problem is that when I asked her who was there she initially denied that he (the friend) was present. Latter she felt guilty and admitted to me that he showed up, but claimed that she was only trying to protect my feelings by lying to me. I know that she didn't expect him to be there and didn't want him there. I just don't know if I can trust her anymore and feel betrayed. I love her very much but feel hurt that I was lied to. What do all of you think of this? Is it a reason to end a relationship? It's really bothering me so I would really appreciate any advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel so pressured and awkward all the time. As a side note guy friends are out of the question. For myself, day to day, my bf and his friends are all i need to fulfill my need to socialize...but I would like friends of my own, too. Its hard to hang out with people or join clubs at school because i commute, and it takes me about 2 hours to get home, and most of the time i work after school so i have to leave right away.

We both have successful careers and are co-breadwinners. We have a 3 y.o. daughter and a 10 m.o. son. We live a comfortable life and our relationship is healthy otherwise.\n\nWhen we first started dating, we had great sex. It was frequent and adventurous. The only odd part was that she never orgasmed and still hasn't to this day. She has always said that sex feels good, but just not good enough to orgasm. I encouraged her to 'explore' her body so that she could figure out what she enjoyed - then she could help me help her!\n\nAnother important detail - she was raped by a friend in college and never reported it or chose to pursue it. She shared the incident with very few people, not even her parents. Over the years I've encouraged her to see a therapist, maybe that experience is part of the problem too. Depression runs in her family (mom and sister have dealt with it) and we're both psych undergrads so I don't underestimate the rape incident or the possibility of depression.\n\nFast forward a few years and we got married and had two kids. As you can imagine, sex slowed down (maybe once every two weeks) and now we haven't had sex for 3 months. Tonight when I initiated (which I literally always do), she finally said it was because she was too fat and disgusting. She's used other excuses in the past, like she's too tired or she just doesn't feel close to me. I know she feels bad because shortly after retreating to our room she texted, \"I'm sorry I'm a bad wife.\" I guess I'm not sure what to do - I love my wife and family and need your help!\nTL;DR:"}

We agreed that I'd pay her back for my share of the rent by transferring the money to her bank account when I started working. When I started the job, I emailed her a payment plan to let her know when to expect the money and asked her for her account information so I could transfer it. She never responded even though I asked her several times for the information. \n\nWe spoke/emailed/Skyped many times after that and even saw each other in person once, but she never brought up the loan again. Because of that, I thought she had decided to forget about it. Last week, she asked me for the money. The problem is, I am starting graduate school and used up the money I'd saved (including the money I'd put aside to pay her back) for tuition (in addition to taking out student loans). I have no income and won't for at least the next two years. I tried to explain this to my friend, but she became really angry and said I was being unfair and was taking advantage of her.\n\nI know I should have set the money that I owed her aside and not used it for tuition, but after almost three years of not mentioning it after I asked for her account info, I truly thought she decided not to ask me to pay back my part of the rent. Now I just don't have the money, and I won't until I start working again. I am hoping to find a part time job so that I could start slowly paying her back. I told her all this and she is still extremely angry.\n\nAnyway, I feel really awful.

I dated another Korean girl before and both her and her friends would occasionally make references to the Japanese occupation of Korea, which gave me the impression that there's still tension between the two countries.\n\nNow my current girlfriend has never said anything that could be described as prejudiced before; I know that she dislikes the Japanese government for refusing to apologise for the persecution of Koreans, but I never thought she disliked Japanese people. She has some very close Japanese friends and she has given herself a Japanese name that she uses more than her English name.\n\nHowever last night, we somehow got onto the topic of Japanese and Korean immigrants in the USA. I mentioned that Japanese families were rounded up during WW2 and put into camps with terrible conditions. She immediately replied \"Good, they did that to us\". She immediately realised what she said and backtracked, saying \"Actually maybe that's not a good thing to say\".\n\nDespite her (sort of) taking back what she said, I just sat there quite shocked, and we  both said nothing for 10 minutes or so. I can tell that she was thinking of a way to explain herself. Eventually she looked at me and said \"Listen, I don't think it's good that Japanese people were treated like that. I'm just glad they got a taste of their own medicine\".\n\nI told her to just stop talking because she was making me angry, and we both dropped it and pretended that the conversation didn't happen. However I can't stop thinking about it, what a disgusting thing to say. Is this a warning sign that I'm dating a crazy racist, despite her showing no hints of prejudice before this? Should I just forget about it and do something if she says anything like that again?\n\nEverything has been great until now. I don't want to ruin what we have because of something (arguably) small like this.\nTL;DR:"}

We have both felt like we need space from each other lately.

It really hasn't been bad...we still hang out and watch  t.v. together and such. But of course there are some confusing emotions going on. The most confusing thing for me has been that he wants me to date someone else before we even think of getting back together so that I understand better how I want to act in a relationship. What? I don't really understand that. And he told me he doesn't want to date any time soon so I don't think it's a way of him pushing me to date so that he can and not feel guilty.

We live together, we both split the rent paying half and half and we both have friends over sometimes. I got reacquainted with a friend that moved out of state for awhile about 2 months ago. Now this guy is living back home and will come here a lot to hang out. My gf was fine with it at first but started to get pissed off that he is coming over too much. I really like this guys company and I dont like that she is trying to tell me when people can come over. He overstays his welcome sometimes and i get that but he is just socially unaware hes a good guy. he just wants to get away from his parents and i dont see why that should be an issue with my gf. he is always nice buys beer and all. But she just keeps getting angrier and angrier. I shouldnt have to ask permision for people to come over imo. She has friends that come by too. She even brought up breaking up over this guy coming over all the time.\n\nAm I out of line for defending my friend? He means a lot to me and she is just getting mad over nothing. He doesn't do anything wrong and i cant see why she feels the need to go in our room and pout that i dont turn him away. Yeah he comes over almost everyday but living with your parents sucks and i feel for him. How should I handle this? Am i being out of line? I mean, I split the bills and dont tell her anything when her friends come over. I jsut don't see why she needs to get mad over guests. he barely even spends the night and i think because i dont live with my parents i shouldnt have to ask her persmission everday that he wants to come by. Should i just break up with her because she is threatening to end a 3 plus year relationship over something stupid like my best friend coming over? I mean, i want friends, i dont want to be alienated and have to ask friken permission to have a friend over.\n\njust wanted some opinions. thanks\nTL;DR:"}

I decided I'd show up for an optional double time Saturday shift and just get work done.  I just finished cutting a hole in the front of the steel door to mount a touchscreen PC, a beautiful clean cut rectangle. Next I drilled a hole for the emergency stop button but the whole is just a prep hole basically. To quickly cut out a larger hoke we use a hydraulic knockout which basically compresses the steel to the point where it shears through to the hole size you want based on the size of the ends you put on it.  \n\nWell I hadn't used it before but I had seen it done so I figured I was OK but I assembled it wrong before pulling the trigger to apply pressure. Instead of staying plumb/strait and pulling right through the thing bent on an angle and locked up and I couldn't get it back out of the hole.  It's a threaded axle that connects to the bit and then back into the tool. Bent a good 20 degree or more angle in that and had to disassemble the whole tool.  When taking it apart I spilled hydraulic fluid all over myself and the floor.  After realizing I couldn't fix it I found my supervisor and owned up to it.  It should be OK and a few people said they not to worry about it but that's pretty hard to do.  The area surrounding the hole is now warped so we have to order a new door and I'll redo it in a week so so, in if I still have my job lol.\nTL;DR:"}

I have terrible trust issues. It flares up every so often, and I become a wreck for no good reason. I know deep in my head that he isn't doing anything wrong, but for some reason in my paranoia I convince myself something is wrong and that I'm being lied to.\n\nI recently found out that, under a year ago, he had been messaging a girl calling her cute, saying \"nice dp ;)\" of her in a really short skanky looking dress, and just stuff like that. I learned about this girl later on, when I saw that she talked to him way too much for it to be a friendly thing, and he TOLD me he would stop talking to her. As far as I know, he has.\n\nThe thing is, I feel awful. Do I have any reason to bring this up with him now, or should I get over it? Am I being unreasonable getting mad at it after so long?

I've been out of the dating scene a few years now after my ex cheated on me and kinda fucked me up. Because of it I now have severe trust issues and it's taken me this long to even allow myself to open up to another female. We get along great, and aside from the lack of intimacy, we are kinda like a couple. We go shopping, cook, hang out, play video games, get high. The problem being: I made a move on her about a month ago, and although she did kiss me back, she said that she's not looking for a relationship right now. There was no awkwardness or anything after that, we just kept doing things like nothing ever happened. I recently learned from one of her friends that she's really depressed (although she doesn't really show it, she's always smiling with me and generally having a good time, at least with me).

How long is it appropriate to wait before discussing finances in depth?\nPOST: I've been dating my boyfriend now for almost three months. We've talked generally about what we do, but I don't really know how much money he makes. It *feels* to me like it would be kind of off putting to flat out ask \"How much do you make, what does your budget look like, and how much debt do you have?\" three months in to the relationship. At the same time though, this kind of stuff does matter. Money isn't everything, but it's fair to wonder where someone stands financially if you're considering them as a future spouse.\n\nHe is a podiatrist that works at an orthopedic surgery group doing all of their foot and ankle procedures. When we talked about it, it was on our first date and just general getting-to-know you stuff. We talked about how long schooling was for him, what it is that he does. Stuff like that. \n\nI get the impression that he earns a comfortable living. I tried googling what they make just to get a feel for it, but the salary seems to be all over the place and depends on where you work. Could be 80k, could be 225k, or anywhere in between. I also don't know exactly how much he spends/budgets/saves. It's hard for me to guess if he is living within his means, conservative, or a big spender. It all depends on what he makes. If he is closer to the 80k side, he's probably pushing it. If he is closer to the 200k end, he is probably a little conservative with finances.\n\nHow can I bring this up without sounding like I'm obsessed with money? I truly don't care *how much* he makes per se. Obviously, he isn't a bum which is really all that matters to me. My real concern is if we're financially compatible in terms of budgeting -- is he a spender or a saver? Financial responsibility is important to me. I'm not a \"gold digger\" at all.

He has taken me as his date to the annual christmas cocktail party two years in a row (at my suggestion), we have made out once (at which he was surprisingly good), but he is somewhat shy when it comes to asking women out. However, a few things have changed, and I now think that I would like to date him.\n\nFirst, Billy has overhauled his appearance. He joined a gym, slimmed down, got a haircut for the first time in two years (THANK GOD) and did something about his caterpillar eyebrows. While incredibly shallow of me, he looks much more presentable now, attractive even.\n\nSecond, and this is the bad part, Billy is now the Vice President of his fraternity. Being his girlfriend would give me considerable status and access to privileges such as t-shirts, sober drivers, better seating at football games in the fall, potential Sweetheart status, and some authority to boss pledges around (which admittedly I do anyway).\n\nI do find Billy attractive, we have lots of similar interests, and we get along well.

He went from messaging me all throughout the day to me having to initiate it every time, and recently, he started ignoring me.\n\nEver since I noticed his changing behaviour I told him about it. He said he was just very busy with work and he was sorry he couldn't give me as much time. I wasn't really satisfied with this answer, though. \n\nAs days went by, he confessed to me that part of him being distant was the fact that he was uncertain about a long-distance relationship (we live about 400 miles apart). He'd had two before, and they turned out quite badly. However, he said he was willing to fight for it because he wanted to be with me.\n\nNow, two days ago, I talked to him on the phone and asked him to straight out tell me what was going on. He said he didn't know, for the entire conversation. There were actually a lot of long silences. He said he wasn't sure about the long distance, and that we had rushed into a sort of relationship without really getting to know each other (which I agree with).\n\nAt the end of the conversation we agreed that we would get to know each other and see what happens, although honestly I don't believe he intends to follow this, because it has been two days and he hasn't contacted me yet. \n\nNow, the tricky part: ever since he's grown cold towards me, he's been spending ALL day on whatsapp, like literally checking it every two minutes which I'd never seen him do. So, I have a nagging suspicion that maybe he has met someone else and has me as a back-up girl. \n\nI have to travel to his city in a few weeks, and I asked him if he wanted to see me. He said yes, and he wants to see what happens.\n\nWhat should I do? Why has he changed so suddenly? Should I indeed visit him when I get there?\nTL;DR:"}

In the rest of the 6 days we get into spats about absolutely anything (we both have our own opinions on various things). \n\nEvery time I see her though at the end of the week I go back to as if we first started dating and I love her all over again. But when I'm not with her I think of dating other girls and 'living the life ' of a 20 year old. \n\nI don't want to break up with her because she has changed her life so drastically for me ( she got braces for me, changed her education for me, stopped talking to her friends). I also don't want to break up with her because she is an amazing girl and we compliment each other really well... But I still want to see what else is on the market. \n\nWhat should I do?

Sometimes I would meet him for lunch or suggest going out for dinner but it is always me initiating and he always wants to stay within his area for dinner. I know that neither of us can afford fancy dates at five star restaurants or a movie night every week and I am okay with that. But he doesn't take me out unless I ask, and even then, the dates are often very casual and not romantic. I guess he prefers to stay in.\n\nThe other day I was talking to a good friend and his girlfriend. He takes her out to see plays, try new food, or to other events in the city (like the carnival in the summer, which I had suggested to my boyfriend as a date, but ended up going with a girl friend because he didn't want to go). It made me think about my own relationship and how less exciting it seemed. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still love my boyfriend very much, which is why I want to find some middle ground with dates where we are both happy and can focus on each other instead of the event at hand.

Six months after I started it, about halfway through, I hit writer's block, badly, and couldn't write more than a sentence per week, if that.  One of my friends, a devout Catholic, asked me when I was going to give her the next chapter to edit and I told her that the novel was a lost cause and I was done with it, instead I was going to work on shorter fiction.\n\nShe ended up getting me a pendant of St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes to help me.  I reminded her that I was atheist but she insisted I take it as a good luck charm.  Since it was a gift I accepted it and would wear it under my shirt.  Eventually after another four months or so of not getting anywhere with the novel I eventually was able to get through the writer's block and I wear the thing quite a bit, I mean I need all the luck I can get.\n\nOne of my friends who is atheist saw it one day and told me that I was a hypocrite for wearing a religious symbol and being an atheist.  I guess he has a point but like I said it was a gift and it's not like I use it for prayer or openly display it, it's tucked under my shirt so only the chain is visible, he just happened to see it when I was changing shirts.  What do you think?  Should I stop wearing it or does it really matter?\nTL;DR:"}

He revealed he had a crush on me from the very beginning, and I made it clear early on that it wasn't going to happen and we should only be friends. At age 17, we experimented sexually for the first time...and have continued ever since. It's ongoing. I've never had a boyfriend (because I don't particularly care for a romantic relationship) and for the most part this is what works best for me.\n\nI'm not a people person; I'm not a little miss sunshine and I can be a downright buzzkill. If I have to be around people \nfor too long, I become a restless and insufferable grump. The \nidea of dating someone full time while working a full time job \nseems unthinkable to me. Too much work, to be completely \nhonest. I'm in a bit of a rut though...as of late, I cannot stand to be around him anymore. I'm not sure what it is, but all of a sudden he's gained a \"holier than thou\" attitude and speaks to me in snarky, disrespectful ways. This was never a problem a year ago. \n\nWe also have much less in common than we did as teens, but I suppose this is to be expected. He's into all kinds of drugs like adderall,roxies, and methamphetamine, and I'm not into any of that. I feel we are going in separate directions, and I wish to move on with my life without him. I have fears, however, that he will reveal things I've told him in confidence. My fetishes that aren't so common, things I've asked him to do, things like that. It would devastate me if these were shared with my family or someone else.\n\nNormally I wouldn't have to worry about him doing this, but with his odd and narcissistic behavior as of late, I'm not sure if I could trust him anymore. \n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

The second time I bought them, I noticed that the register charged me $1.35. I said something to the cashier, he went over and verified the price, and picked up a pack of cookies that was $1.19 to charge me with. This same thing happened the next four times I went to this gas station, with different cashiers and different outcomes. One time I ended up getting my fourth pack free, and the most recent time, the guy told me there was nothing he could do and to come back in the morning. \n\nIt's annoying that this keeps happening and no one is fixing it. It's lazy at best, and a deceptive business practice at worst. I spent last night researching statutes pertaining to item pricing and found things for other states, but not Nevada. A Michigan statute required a refund and a penalty payment, and gave the right to sue for $250 in small claims court. More importantly, this store could be doing this for other items and doing it intentionally, and that's not okay. \n\nWho can I complain to? Who investigates this type of bad business practice? If anyone could help me find the Nevada statutes (if any) that cover this, or has advice for how to move forward, I'd appreciate it!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm fairly new here, so I don't know too much about how this site works as far as posting goes. \n\nI just got out of a really rough patch. My first relationship ended in a really bad way. Friends were lost, other people revealed themselves to be my true friends and my ex and I are on awful terms. I thought I was happy in that relationship but retrospectively there were many things that I should have noticed beforehand to spare myself the trauma that I have endured for these past few months.\n\nWhen talking to family at a going away party, a cousin of mine suggested that I talk to an old friend of mine (21/M that I mentioned in the title) to strike something up. We were rather fond of each other back in high school but neither of us said anything about it to initiate any type of dating. We haven't gone to the same school in three years, but we have kept in contact minimally, exchanging birthday wishes, and randomly dropping in on one another to check up. Most people that I talk to confirm that he still has feelings for me, and I have enough feelings to want to ask him out on a date.\n\nThe problem is that we don't talk frequently enough to have a basis for me to be able to simply say, \"Hey! Let's go on a date!\" without it seeming out of nowhere, and I am not at all keen on how to get dates. My ex and I had shared classes together in high school, and he was the one who initiated our circumstances. Up until then, I had never had a boyfriend before. Only several potentials.\n\nSo my question is, Reddit, how would I go about asking out an old friend of mine without it seeming to spring out of nowhere/ looking like a weirdo? Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

A little background: we've been dating 15 months, no problems, no suspicion of infidelity, we live a few states away from each other, but we talk daily and believe that we are ready to meet and fornicate. Unfortunately, I'm not a sneaky person, nor was I as a teenager, and my parents believe him to be a 60 year old man with no teeth, they're also highly religious and basically believe the internet is the devil, so I don't believe there's a way for me to do this without sneaking. We talked about getting him a hotel and him picking me up during the day/at night, but I have a cat, who when lonely, claws at the door, so if I lock her in here and she meows and claws without answer, they will know something is up. *Fuck.* So I guess I have to sneak him into my house. My problem is: How. I live on the bottom floor, alone, next to the back gate. However my father is currently job hunting and wakes up at about 6 AM every morning to get ready for the day. My idea is to sneak him in around 10 when my dad falls asleep, and to have him gone before my dad gets out of his bedroom around 7, but I feel like this is too high risk. It's also kind of taboo which makes me excited. I know this sounds ridiculous but ANY help is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [17/F] want to become closer with an older student [20/M] in college.\nPOST: Hello! I am currently a freshman in university. A few weeks ago, I met an older guy named Lucas at a party. He's an exchange student from Italy and was very funny and kind, although a bit shy. I really enjoyed talking to him  and wanted to get to know him better. Part of the reason I want to talk to him is because he doesn't have too many friends (I've moved 8 times in my life, so I definitely know how it feels to come into a new environment where everyone already has friends and social circles). The other reason is well, I genuinely think he's a cool guy. \n\nNow, let me preface. A lot of my friends here think that the only reason why I want to \"get to know him\" is because I'm sexually attracted to him. But the truth is, I am totally fine with being good friends. I grew up with two older brothers, their friends, and a group of guy cousins and I am most comfortable when hanging out with older guys. It is all completely platonic, and in fact, many of my older friends have become \"big brother\" figures to me. I guess it was easier when I was younger, but my friends tell me that now that I'm nearly 18, I can't just \"be friends\" with older guys because they will take it the wrong way (which is understandable).\n\nAnyway, Lucas and I obviously have no classes in common but we do say hi and chat a little every time we see each other. However, I don't think I'm at that point where he'll be comfortable with anything more substantial. Would it be weird to ask him if he wants to hang out or if I can get his number? I realize that can come off the wrong way, and that is what I am most worried about. \nPlease let me know what you believe is the best thing I should do. Before uni, I was totally comfortable with just hanging out with older guys but I can now see why it's different in college. If you were Lucas, how would you feel if I came up to you and asked to hang out? \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

First off, got into a decent university and was accepted into their Aerospace Engineering Major. Started to do bad in physics, got Academic Probation because having mediocre grades (B-C) and an F (or 2, yeah Physics\u2026) can really hurt. Dropped into Undeclared Engineering because of my belief that I wasn't all that bad (big mistake) and could still make it. \n\nCome summer, my grades were still relatively shit (GPA at 2.25, average for engineer student: 2.75). Took some time and asked my friends what they would do in my shoes (which was extremely hard, as they are all smart and I didn't want to be looked down upon\u2026stupid pride), and finally decided, enough is enough. Switched out to Business Economics and now my Major GPA is relatively high but my overall is still a lovely 2.2 (Only my single variable calculus class was counted into my Major GPA)\n\nMy question is this, to all you people who look at resumes, if I were to send my Major GPA, would you then ask to see my overall GPA? Or is there not even an option to show your Major GPA and you automatically have to send in what your overall is? \n\nAlso, I know that for the most part a lot of people have been telling me to not worry as much, because if I get an internship then for some strange reason, I'll magically be fine.

We found each other late 2010, and have built up a friendship since then. Fast forward to August 2014, we made a phone call that lasted the whole night, and that call was what made me interested in him as more of a friend. We then agreed to meet later that month, which became a weekly thing of us to meet each other, and then it would become twice or three times a week. We have exchanged intimate gestures during these meetings.\n\nThe next month was what really broke me. I found out that he already had a girlfriend of one year. That day, his then girlfriend texted me, asking how long I've been together with him. I guess she found out first, confronted him, then asked me for clarification. After this incident, I threatened to cut off all contacts with him, but I just couldn't. A part of me wanted him to stay. I still kept contact with him, about how this is going to work, and what we were going to do. He asked for a week to sort things out.\n\nA week later, he told me that he had broken up with his then-girlfriend. Since that day, our relationship has gotten better and better, but deep down, I still feel very bad for causing them to break up. Am I a \"homewrecker\"? Do I have to feel this guilt?

And tonight (and periodically over the last couple weeks) he was a combination of those three. \n\nWe've been together for 3 years, and I've dealt with his condescending and rude tone of voice when he's frustrated or impatient before. I always try my hardest to speak in a manor that won't provoke that sort of response. However, I'm coming to a point where I'm simply too frustrated to even try anymore. \n\nTonight we argued over a difference of opinion on something really silly. And he talked over me, interrupted me, scoffed at me, and in the end discouraged me from wanting to speak at all. I snapped, and told him that i was going to sleep in the guest bedroom because I didn't want to be around him anymore. \n\nHe sort of haphazardly attempted to guilt trip me about whether or not i loved him, and this sort of spiraled me out of control into a full blown temper tantrum. He asked me if I wanted to talk about it tomorrow, I told him if his behavior changed, then maybe. \n\nI'm now in the guest room, and have cooled off a little. But, I feel really discouraged from even trying to *attempt* another conversation about how he talks to me. \n\nEvery conversation in the past has ended with him barraging me with criticism about how I'm too sensitive, and he doesn't want to walk on eggshells around me. And, I've tried as hard as I can to toughen myself up so he doesn't have to do any of that. But, I can't even tell anymore if he's just kind of an asshole, or if I really am just too tender. \n\nFrankly... I don't even know how to try and remedy this problem anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

She bought a lot of stuff, a closet, child proofing (her son, insemination kid from before we met), payed for the moving company,  curtains and such. \n\nI rented a room to my sister for a year and she moved out last month, before my GF was able to move in, so had higher rent. \n\nFirst off - this is not an issue between us at all. \n\nI'm wondering what is fair, she payed for a lot of things, I would like to pitch in, she says \"no, you had the double rent\" etc, but I fear she is being way too nice and screwing herself over. \n\nSo, basically, I would like to split it in half, but then I think; She's moving into a huge apartment I've spent 3 years making nice, with Sonos and a nice high fi and Hue lights everywhere, painted, fixed floors, new dish washer, oven, fridge etc. She gets to use all this.\n\nBut still - she didn't ask me for any of the above. \nPoint is, I don't want to be an ass, but both things seem like something you can defend. \n\nWhat is fair?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I 23f am scared that I am falling in love with my lover 31m 4 months.\nPOST: I started casually dating my lover for the last few months. We used to have a serious relationship but broke up. I didn't want to be with him again, because I didn't feel like I am ready to be in a relationship. I also didn't want to become serious with him again, because of the past. I didn't want to start something only to have it end.\n\nAnother reason that I didn't want to get serious with him is because we have some major differences. I am a religious girl of a certain faith, and he is from an entirely different faith. Sometimes he does things that are considered sins in my religion. This is a problem for me. I don't want to love someone if he does things that I don't agree with or can not do with him. I feel like I may end up engaging in the same behaviors just because I am with him. \n\nI don't know what to do about this. I know you can not force someone to change, especially when it comes to something like religion. But my religion is very important to me, and I can't compromise on it.\n\nThat is why I am so unsure about pursuing a deeper relationship with him. In my mind once you become serious with someone, then there is no going back. That is why I want to be very careful about the person I am dating. \n\nAnd on one hand, he is very caring, considerate of me. He also tries to make me smile, and make me feel good. I do the same for him. I like him as a person, I think he would be a good partner. \n\nHowever, his lifestyle is an issue for me. I don't like some of the thing that he does. He drink a lot of alcohol. Also, he went to a festival where everything they ate there is not allowed in my religion. I have brought this up to him, and he said he will try to be better. But I am not sure what he will do. \n\nMy question is what should I do? Should I follow my heart, and be with someone I am falling in love with? Or should I slow the relationship down and become less serious about him?\nTL;DR:"}

My husband is oldest of 10. Most of his siblings are \"adults\" and shitty ones. We spent $850 to fly his 14 y.o sister out to his and her grandparents, which is where we all are now. I like her enough when I can get past her angsty mumbling. She literally wants to do nothing all day and interact with no one unless forced, which is fine, but I personally find her attitude borderline disrespectful.\n\nAnyway, today I was sick, visibly, and I was kind of pissed bc my husband seemed too occupied by whatever he was doing to \"take care of me.\" I don't want to sound like a dependent pansy, but everyone likes to be taken care of now and then. He asked if I needed him to get anything from the store and brought the laundry in and put it on the bed. As he was walking out he asked if I was okay, to which I said yes. I spent basically all day in bed or on the couch, but other than those encounters he did not acknowledge me.\n\nFast forward to later this afternoon. His sister doesn't want to leave her room (like every other day) and all of a sudden she is sick, too. Well howdy do, if everyone, including my husband, didn't fucking jump up and start trying to nurse her to health. They were finding crackers getting pills and his grandfather made a trip to the store to get stomach medicine. My husband specially took all of this in to her, made sure she took it, and said \"love you\" when he left the room.\nI won't deny that it's jealousy, but I think I am validated in feeling the way I do. Where was that concern and attention a couple hours ago when I was sick? Am I crazy here? I said something to my husband and he just thinks I'm blowing things out of proportion and almost made it MY fault that I felt this way. But that is a reoccurring theme with us I feel.

Sadly, I have started to have strong feelings for this new guy and I feel conflicted as to what to do. I still love my boyfriend, but its different (and it may just be the 2 year inch or just passion is gone, but I am dealing with it well). And of course this new relationship is new and its exciting. So I dont want to confuse new with actually wanting to be with this new guy. \n\nI guess I do love both of them but they are two very different people and can provide different things. Boyfriend has a degree but no job (going on 7 months of useless job searching) and we have been through a lot together. And we just click and are comfortable with our lives. (Btw, we lived together for two years, but due to no job he moved back with his parents). (I am not rich enough to support both of us, I am a college student). \n\nThe new guy, has a job (very good job) and has a nice family (boyfriends family isnt too keen on liking me due to irrelevant reasons.

The four of us are middle class Americans here on a research grant, and the factory is being paid for by a nonprofit affiliated with our university.\n\nWe have paid a builder to construct the office, and 2-3 other guys around 30 years old often help out during the day.\n\nWe arrive around 8:30AM so are hungry for lunch around 12PM. We normally bring the basic ingredients for PB&J with us and drive to a nearby gas station to eat the sandwiches. We do this because sharing is a strong cultural value they have here, especially with food. Until now, our gas station trips haven't been a big deal.\n\nThe first day, the workers asked us to bring lunch for them the next day. Realizing that would set a precedent, we contacted our community partner, who told us we didn't need to do that since it was not our job to provide them with food.\n\nToday (1 week in, 3 weeks left), we didn't have much work since the materials had not arrived for construction. When one of us told the guys that we were going to the gas station for lunch, one of them tried to come with us and another asked us to buy them a loaf of bread. We felt terrible declining both of them and were quite awkward about the whole situation.\n\nHow should we tell them that we are taking our lunch break on days when there is no work to do?

They said I'll be in pain for a good 2 weeks, and I'll ne able to do whatever I want in 3 weeks, but that if I feel up to working out or doing physical activity at any time during that past 3 days, I wouldn't be doing damage to the stitches or anything like that.\n\nIt hurt like hell, I was on hydrocodene + acetaminophen for the pain, and I felt like doing nothing but comfort food and sleep.\n\nToday, I decided that instead of Redditing and going to bed at 2 AM, I'd finally get up and exercise. I popped some tylenol, used my nasal sprays, \n\nAnd got out and biked for 10 miles. Then I did that scientific 7 minute workout all the way through. This is the first time I've worked out in a year.\n\nI am a slightly overweight 19 year old male, and for the first time in a year, I feel great about myself. And it's thanks to this Sub.\nTL;DR:"}

His brother is Tyler. Tyler has been an alcoholic since I have known him (6 yrs). He recognized the problem around 3 years ago and has been in and out of rehabs ever since, not being able to complete a full program. He has consistently stolen money from his brother Chris and alcohol from our home to feed his habit. \n\nLast year he got into a hit-and-run DUI situation and had two choices: face jail for 180 days, or complete an intensive DUI court program. He chose the DUI program and immediately checked into a residential rehab. Fast forward to now, his rehab program is coming to an end, and he asked my husband if he can move in with us until he is able to get back on his own two feet. He also stated he wanted to bring a girl he met in the rehab clinic, who is a recovering heroin addict. \n\nKeep in mind, before his current rehab program, I have never seen Tyler stay sober for more than a couple weeks. He also pretty much abandoned his daughter, who is 4.\n\nI am no one to judge, and I want to be here to support him and his new girlfriend, as I understand it must be extremely difficult to overcome such an obstacle, however I do not want me or my husband to be seen as a doormat. \n\nMy brain is extremely fuzzy and I am coming here because I am not sure what would be the right or wrong thing to do.\nTL;DR:"}

But I didn't have any costume for the event, so I went to the mall. Then I saw this Slenderman costume which looks incredible in the picture and also had 30% discount (It was like 90 dollars without it, wtf Mexico). It was perfect, I put it on and saw that it was fine.\n\nThen the day of the party arrived and it was extremely cold, so my friend (yeah, that friend the men have) was calm down and feeling short. So I just put my costume on and get into the party.\nIt was horrible, no one knew what was Slenderman and then a lot of people thought that my costume was something like a stripper. Then a girl that I liked a lot was laughing like there was no tomorrow. I begun getting nervous and so the cold went away and my little friend decided it was time to be the protagonist. Holy shit, it was like if I didn't have anything put on, I was dying from all the glances I was getting. And to finished my fuck up then my friends from my old school arrived, thankfully someone gave me something to hide my dick and my shame.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [25M] don't know if I can handle my girlfriend's [19F] emotional and psychological issues anymore\nPOST: This makes me feel like a jerk. I've been with my girlfriend a bit over a year, and I'd say we were \"effectively\" together for 6 months to a year before that. I took things very, very slowly (a rarity for me) based on a number of factors. One of them was her age. One of them was the fact that she has some very serious psychological and emotional issues and I knew it would be irresponsible of me to just dive into a relationship thinking I could fix them (I've had a long string of issues with trying to \"fix\" girls in the past).\n\nAfter courting for a very long time and getting to know each other very well, I believed I was ready for the relationship, despite everything. She has so many positive qualities that I believed were worth the effort. I also believed her issues would get better. I'll be honest, I really didn't come close to understanding the depth of how serious these things can be. I've learned a huge amount about depression, eating disorders, and a host of other issues. I've gained a huge amount of empathy on the subjects.\n\nWith that said, I just don't feel like I can take it anymore. Nothing is getting better. She's making little or no effort to get better, and often claims she doesn't want to get better. I know these are symptoms of the very diseases she's trying to treat, but I'm not a psych professional. I don't know what else I can do other than offer support and encourage her to seek treatment.\n\nI have a laundry list of reasons and excuses ranging from bullshit to (I believe) legitimate, but none of them are stopping me from feeling like a complete bastard for abandoning someone who's still in need. I know I'm the only pillar of emotional strength that she has, and the idea of just leaving her high and dry makes me sick. But it's killed all the passion and love in the relationship. I don't think I want to be here anymore, but I'm scared to leave.\n\nI don't think this is an especially novel situation. I'm sure a lot of people have been through it. Maybe some perspective or some advice will help me figure out what I should do.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [25 M] Caught in a hard place between friendship, attraction, and common crowds\nPOST: I've been a transplant to a new city for a little under a year now so few acquaintances in or out of work (The 2nd youngest person at my workplace is literally over double my age, not really people I can hang with after hours) and even fewer people I'd call friends; let's just say this city has been described as a nice but difficult place to form lasting friendships. Lucky me though, I had found one close friend [26/F] but, of course, I've developed deeper feelings as we hung out over the months. \n\nIf this were back home, I'd be fine with just outright asking her out for a date/if she was interested in a relationship. In this case though, we both know so few people, we run with similar, small crowds and obviously I don't want to create that awkward atmosphere that could result from it assuming it doesn't work out whereas at home I can sorta fan out more thanks to larger social circles. I also feel like she's really the only true friend I have in the area since she's the only one that consistently invites me out to stuff and we see each other near weekly. Additionally, just from my POV and where we both are in life, it would be hard to see a relationship going the distance. It's not as fun being with her anymore because of all this but I know we'll keep running into each other because of the previous reasons of similar social circles and because we're extremely similar in hobbies and interests.\n\nSo, I'm not sure where I stand/what I want, or exactly how I would frame my question for help on this. I don't think I want to ask her out and it is getting more difficult to be with her. But I know if I were to just cut off contact, I'd have to pretty much stop going to all the activities I attend now since there would be a great chance at seeing her there.\nTL;DR:"}

We started off as fwb for about a year and decided to get into a relationship about a year ago. We are both extreme opposites as I'm an introvert, he's an extrovert. everything he likes I don't and vice versa. I only talk when necessary and he can never seem to shut up. He has so much energy and affection while I never seem to have enough of either. \n\nBeing opposites can sometimes work to my benefit like when we're out with friends he takes the pressure off of me to make small talk. But his energetic personality literally drains me. He always loves having me around but i'm the kind of person that needs a LOT of alone time and silence especially after a day with him.\n\nOur opposite personalities aren't the only issue. The biggest issue in my relationship is me. I'm a very selfish, cold, bitter, unforgiving, emotionally detached(or numb) person. I've had multiple people tell me this. As you could imagine, this drives people i'm in a relationship with insane (one ex tried to kill both me and himself because of it!). Whenever we get into a fight they go crazy yelling, trying to reach or get a reaction from a mute dead-eyed dummy. All I can seem to do is sit there like a statue and reply only in my head. It's like those dreams where to trying to explain something to someone but can never get your words out. I feel like a robot that shuts down at the times I should be expressing my feelings.\n\nWhen we are getting along and I want to be affectionate and cuddle him and show him I at least care about him, it feels physically impossible to reach over or open my damn mouth. I have given him many chances to leave. I tell him that if he does not like the person that I am, he can leave with no animosity. But somehow he loves me and refuses to let go. How can I fix myself for him and why can't I just act like a normal human being?\nTL;DR:"}

He seemed concerned but not enough to disrupt his bedtimes. a few nights later he would point to were it was (bare spot on the wall) and said 'shoot it'. At this point my wife and I were assuming he had a great imagination and since he was going to sleep with no problem we didn't see the harm.

We would tell him we would protect him and we didn't have any guns to shoot it.The next day our son brought up the Owl to our neighbour who was visiting. This was the first time he brought it up in the day time not only that whenever he talked about it from here on he was make a triangle with his hands like Jay-Z or some weird Illuminanti hand signal. My wife is expecting our second child next month so it could also be a result of the new addition to the family.

I work the overnight shifts and when my shift is over, the person that works day shifts comes in to relieve me. \n\nThe person (50 M) that relieves me in the mornings a few of the days each week (we'll call him John) is an absolute pleasure to talk with. He often comes in 45 minutes early, giving us plenty of time to chat. John has discussed with me person struggles he experiences, many stories of his life, and provided me with many bouts of laughter. He has shared with me that he is recently divorced. I have, in turn, shared aspects of my own personal life with him, which has sparked a few really great conversations. I've rarely found myself sexually attracted to anyone over the relative age of 30, so the fact that I find John *very* sexually attractive is quite a new experience to me.  \n\nA couple weeks ago John and I exchanged numbers, because he offered to come to my apartment to fix something that had broke. That never ended up happening because my landlord fixed it, however I now have his number in my phone, and he has mine. Just yesterday, John stated if i'm ever bored one of these evenings that he'd like to go for coffee 'man'. He constantly calls me 'man' or 'buddy', which throws me off. It makes me unsure how he views me. \n\nAnyways, I have a very large desire to have a casual sex/fling with this man. Reddit, should I even try to initiate anything? If so, how? Or should I leave it be due to the obvious reasons of being co-workers and a significant age gap?\nTL;DR:"}

She also has alot of trust issues from her past relationships.\n\nI am a very independent guy I like doing my own thing but I still invited her to come the gym with me and set up a meal plan for her to try and get her to be abit more positive with everything. \n\nUnfortunatly this hasn't helped, I am so very close to leaving her because all of this is starting to effect my mental state. Im not happy when I'm at home I'm happy when I'm at work or at the gym. Im quick to anger now because of all the issues I have tried to help deal with on a constant basis.\n\nI love her and I want her to be happy but it's not selfish of me to want to be happy myself and I just don't see myself being happy living with her. I have asked her to go see professional help but she refuses. Im running out of reasons to stay with her..\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me 20 M with my 19/F gf 3 months, she almost dumped me cause she saw my first flaw\nPOST: So there is a huge back story to this but i will just summarize it as my girlfriend has been with a lot of assholes in the past and i guess as a result is used to hopping from guy to guy. We are currently doing long distance as I am going to school about an hour away but we manage to see each other once a week. Anyway last weekend i came home to see her and I had to cut our date short because my mom was freaking out about something and i had to go home, so i dropped her off early. She saw this as a huge wrong i guess as my parents were too strict and it wasn't going to work out in the long run. She was probably going to dump me right their if i didn't comfort her. We made up and got past that nicely but that whole situation is now making me re evaluate our entire relationship. I cared so much about her and look past her many flaws but if she gets that hindered at only seeing my first flaw what sort of person is she? Does she even care about me as much as i care for her? it was scary how quickly she could just uproot and leave. Maybe i became to emotionally attached because this is my first real girlfriend but i don't know what to think of it. I've seen her in a different light and can't really unsee it now. She has only called me three times since we starting dating or else im usually the one to initiate conversation, text her. I guess I am afraid of how much she can hurt me now that when i talk to her its more for the idea that she won't break up with me now than to make her happy. Will time change my view of her? am i just over reacting. What we had was awesome but right now i cant even have fun around her its honestly like I am just frightened she will leave. It also seems like i am the nicest guy she has been with in a while too. Any advice on what to do would be great.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What to do with bed bugs?\nPOST: Almost a year ago, I found that I had been randomly getting bug bites all over my body. Being big into running, and living in a somewhat humid place, I assumed they were mosquitoes and let them be.\n\nOnce the weather turned south, I stopped my daily runs but noticed that the bites were still appearing. With a little bit of Google magic, I discovered bed bugs as a possible cause. One day, in a fit of curiousity, I turned my mattress on it's side and took a look. To my horror, there were hundreds, if not thousands, of the things just chillin' down there.\n\nSo that day, I proceeded to get a bunch of plastic bags, stuff my old sheets, blankets, and pillowcases into them, and cleaned my room like crazy. I put a plastic cover over my mattress, to trap any of the bugs that survived in there, and got all new sheets. After all of that, while everything was dissembled, I threw in a few bug bombs for good measure.\n\nThis all seemed to work great for about 4-5 months, until sometime last week when I noticed a few new bites. As I was getting into bed earlier tonight, I saw a bed bug run across my pillow.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [35 F] of a year, won't communicate for a week.\nPOST: My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for a year long distance, we met in person and we've met since then since she's from the US and I'm from Canada. But we haven't seen each other since the beginning of December due to health emergencies on her side, work and debt from said medical stuff. \n\nMeanwhile I've been busy with school and work as well where I live. But the problem here is that from time to time, and up to including most recently and a tad more frequently it seems, she just shuts off for a week. \n\nThis means, no texts, no emails, and not online on skype. Sometimes it's a week, in the past it's been 2 weeks, or as short as 5 days. Regardless, it makes the long distance we deal with seem more difficult than it already is. \n\nHer reasons? either it's that her phone wasn't working, tired from work, time for herself. We already don't text that frequently, besides the gaps, I'll usually get a text or two from her in a day on average and a Skype call a week. \n\nThis last communication gap got under my skin after she texts me saying she got her phone upgraded she says a bunch of sweet things and asking how my weekend was. I may have been snide but I said \"Hey I would've appreciated it in the week it took for you to get back to me that you could have made time to at least email or communicate in some way, shape or form.\" and she replies saying that she doesn't like my tone and that she'll \"skype or whatever\" when she gets home from work.\nTL;DR:"}

Impact injury/\nPOST: I've looked up common running injuries and nothing matches this. Thursday I did a mile and maybe pushed myself a little more than usual, but felt fine. Yesterday my inner calves, the bottom six inches or so, were a little sore, more like a bruise than muscle pain. But they looked fine and felt normal, no pain when touched. So I went running again this morning. Did a couple miles before I had to stop at a red light and then realized that it suddenly felt like the bottom half of my calves (not extending to my ankles/feet) were on fire. It's gotten a lot better just the last few hours, but it's still a little sore. Back to where it was this morning. I run mostly on concrete sidewalks, but today I did half my run on a gravel path. Do you know what this is? Can I go run tomorrow? I walk 3 miles every day as part of my commute to work, and live up 3 flights of stairs. So having an injury that makes walking difficult would be a complete nightmare.\nTL;DR:"}

Help.\nPOST: Just broke up with my latest boyfriend (29/m), with whom I've been for 1.5 years. He wasn't having sex with me at all (I posted about it a few months back) and he admitted he was asexual. We tried to work it out to no avail. Last night we had a frank talk about his feelings and he confessed that before me he was very lonely and he just wanted a best friend to live with, and that's what I was to him. He's never wanted sex or seen me in an intimate way and I think that, without that, we're just friends and that's not what a relationship should be.\n\nThe reason my last boyfriend (of 1 year) and I split is very similar, he confessed that he hadn't really ever loved me and was with me because he was lonely and it was good to live with someone \"to share the bills\".\n\nThe story goes back for three more boyfriends, I'm a serial long term dater. Similar stories including another asexual boyfriend and another boyfriend who lived with me because it was cheaper than leaving alone.\n\nI'm now nearing my 30s, have moved 7 times in the last 4 years, and lost lots of my savings to contributing to building \"a home\" with these guys. If I told my family (they live in another country), they would despise me, they think I'm just unable to hold a boyfriend down because I'm a bad person somehow. They met my recent boyfriend and loved him, and now I need to break the news to them... That I've lost yet another relationship.\n\nI'm hopeless guys, I don't want to move again, I don't want to start over, I'm so exhausted... Anyway, it's good to vent. I could use a hug.

Both college students, he just started nursing school here and I am having insecurities.\nPOST: My boyfriend is great! He's honest and caring, kind and honorable. I love him very much. We have so much fun together and do spend a lot of time together. I can see myself ending up with him. \n\nI am asking /r/relationships for help with my insecurities. We are in college and I somehow feel uncomfortable with him being around other girls. He is in the nursing school and one of two guys (the other guy is gay). I feel threatened by the girls who he is around. Their classes are several hours long each, and very small. \n\nThe main kicker is that his ex girlfriend is also in nursing, and theres a very high chance she'll be in his classes containing 5-7 people. She's already in his larger lecture classes. There's nothing \"weird\" between him and his ex, they're done and have moved on. \nI have a hard time understanding that they aren't thinking about their history when around eachother, because that has never been the case with my ex. My ex doesn't seem to be able to stay in communication with me and not \"feel anything\" for me, while I am well past feeling anything for him. Basically, It wasn't a very mature breakup and was a breakup where we didn't even talk for a year afterwards. \n\nI know a lot of the reason I feel uncomfortable is that I am very frequently hit on myself. My boyfriend doesn't flirt around or really do anything to make me feel badly. He trusts me completely. I just need to work on my trust issues. \n\nI was seriously emotionally cheated on in this past relationship and I didn't even know until a year and a half later. I need to break free from my worries so that I can feel more relaxed, happy, and independent. I want to go out and do my \"own thing\" more, and be able to trust fully again.\nTL;DR:"}

So like a good dissenter, I posted a status using many of those words. Some of the words are so benign that it'd be impossible to avoid using them, words like \"pork.\" I used some of the words with the overall meaning being that I wouldn't want to anger the government. It was obviously poking fun at the list, but now I can't access my facebook from my computer or my phone. Part of me is thinking that it's just a problem with facebook. The other part of me is thinking \"well, what did you think was going to happen?\" I see a black bag in my future, being sat down under a bright lamp in a dark room being asked \"do you think national security is a joke?\" To which, I would respond, \"Well it most definitely seems that way.\"\nTL;DR:"}

Well the cashier had forgotten to take it off and we didn't notice until we got home. \n\nAbout three days later (it was about a 30 minute drive to the store we purchased them from where we lived, so there was no sense in driving back the day of) we brought our receipt back and asked them to take off the badge thing. They refused saying we were attempting to steal them although we had clearly walked in with the pants in hand and directly to customer service. \n\nI understand some people will take stuff of the rack and give a previous receipt asking for money back, that sorta thing but come on..? Do you think a clean cut mother with a 4 year old girl and 7 year old boy is going to steal child's pants? That also made a $200 purchase three days earlier? The manager even treated us like criminals and we ended up having to throw away a perfectly good pair of pants because they thought we were stealing.\n\nI will now always check in front of cashiers as they put the clothes in the bag that they remove those things.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [35M] ex-boyfriend of 6 years claims I [30F] owe him money.\nPOST: I'm looking for a reality check. I dated someone for six years. For a time, he made more than I did and even helped support me for a few months while I was unemployed. Then, after he got laid off, he chose to work for himself (which I supported), and he had very little income for around two years. During this time, I paid the vast majority of the rent, bills, and everything else. I felt like we were just working together like couples do, especially when we were both employed and both spent money on things together, regardless of whether he spent more or less money than I did.\n\nAfter six years, I realized the relationship wasn't going to work. We'd been having trouble for a long time even though we tried to fix it through therapy (that I paid for) and having me see doctors. I hadn't wanted to be intimate with him for an extended period. I wasn't happy with our financial situation, we got along less and less, I became depressed, and I felt trapped. I was afraid to end the relationship; I was in a new city where I had few friends and little support. I found someone new, but I was 100% up-front about the situation with him and never cheated.\n\nIt's been many months since the relationship was over. We've recently had to talk. He thinks that I was cruel to him, that I destroyed his confidence, mentally abused him, and ended the relationship when I was bored with him. Now, he's trying to claim that I owe him \"reparations\" because him having to leave was expensive, and because he supported the lifestyle we lived while he was making more money than me.\n\nI told him that I don't owe him anything. There were no loans or any formal lending involved, nothing signed, and not even a hint that if we broke up that he'd demand money from me. I know I hurt him, and I don't like that, but I think him asking me for money (when he's mentioned that he doesn't need it) is unreasonable. Am I nuts?\nTL;DR:"}

At the time, I already had my doubts, but it seemed like the idea of a god made her happy.\n\nWhen the church she was baptized at found out she had passed away, they sent her family her certificate of baptism (they have those?) along with her membership records, etc.  Now her family (who is not actively religious) and her friends (who are) are thanking me for \"working so hard to 'save her soul'\" when we were younger.\n\nIt occurred to me this morning that the notion of an afterlife may have been what enabled her to take her own life.

I'm a college student, and I have never been good in the dating environment because I used to be a fat guy on school so now that I'm on college i started working out on the gym, eating healthy but there's a thing that I can't do... and that's to get a date, but last summer I was on the beach with a few friends and one day i met a classmate of one of my friends, I asked my friend to introduce me to her friend too see my luck. \n\nNow have been 6 months since we met, and we have talked everyday since we met, but when comes the time to ask her out she always says yes and when the day of date arrives she doesn't answer her phone, has an excuse that she can't make it or something like that, then she apologies and just because I still have a crush on her I forgive her.\nTL;DR:"}

But at the time she was in a relationship with someone else.\nFrom my point of few we build up some chemistry in those 3 months but we where both to shy/scared to make a move so I ended up in the \"friendzone\". \nThe moment i noticed my feelings towards her was when we where watching a move in her room and we locked eyes for a few seconds and things got real quiet while we continued staring. at that moment i started falling in love and i think she felt something too.\nAfter we came back home we still had contact and met up a few time but with the summer break keeping us apart that slowly decayed. but i can not stop thinking about her.\nNow 6 months later, and 4 months after she broke up with her boyfriend, we started talking again and we are meeting up this friday. (dont know what the plans are yet)\n*As for my question:* I want to know if you have any advice to break the friendzone and make a new start after a wile of not seeing her. i am almost certain she was interested in me at some point. could i still have a chance?\n\nMany thanks for any advice or experiences you can share with me!\nTL;DR:"}

I met a girl at a bar and we really hit it off, one of those times when you meet someone and feel like you've known them forever. \n\nLater that night we got separated, I forgot to get her number and didn't see her again.\nA few days later I noticed I was thinking about her lot.

I did the entire do's and don'ts of break ups like beg, cry etc.\n\nSo I began NC, did it for 5 weeks I went to talk to her it was little weird at first but then it was ok small chats I tried to become her friend again, At one point I asked if I'm a nuisance talking to her she told me far from it I thought things was going great. Then one day during the week after NC she asked me do I really want to be her friend I lied and said yea. She said how can you go from being madly in love with someone to being just friends she told she doesn't feel happy talking to me all she feel is pain and anger. She told how her anger is building up so much just talking to me right now.\n\nI tried to explain lets work it out and be friends but she wasn't hearing it. So I ask her two questions do you still think about me and will you block me from whatsapp. For the first questions she refused to answer then she agreed to unblock me from whatsapp.\n\nI haven't talked to her since then for 4 weeks now, I want to give this one shot. During NC I got myself together dated partied bettered myself but I still miss her, I'm at the point that if she rejects me I can deal with it and get over it yea I will be little hurt and upset but not like the first time.\n\nWhat I really need advice on is taking her to dinner. What I have planned is sending her 24 roses with an note just saying \"Dinner?\". I'm not putting her on the spot and if she doesn't want to talk she wont reply.

How do I start over?\nPOST: I'm 25, and have lived in a major metro area for the past 3 years, which I've really loved. When I moved here straight out of college, I worked for a huge global corporation, which was miserable. I've since moved to a much smaller company, which I love working for, in theory. I believe in their mission, I like the actual work I'm doing, and our team is really close - but at the same time, I feel as though it's crushing my soul. \n\nI just came back from a trip which helped me realize that, no matter where I work, the corporate lifestyle is one that's never going to be fulfilling to me. I've always been very active and crave being outdoors and know that a career that aligns with those passions is what I need to be happy. \n\nThat being said - I'm at odds with the fact that this goes against everything I've worked towards, up to this point. I've always been very competitive and pushed myself to check off these boxes on some arbitrary \"success to-do list\" (student-athlete? check. Ivy league education? check. Prestigious internships? check. Job that contributes to society? check) while balancing a busy social life, training for races, etc., and I feel as though all of a sudden, none of that makes me happy.

However, I do not feel this way. I've actually been feeling pretty shitty:\n\n1) It's been a year since my ex-girlfriend dumped me and I'm still not over it. I've tried reaching out to her and I usually get no response, which just make me feel like more shit. She's definitely moved on with new guys and she's killing life. It's definitely affected how I interact with girls currently.\n\n2) I've had over 40 job interviews with some awesome firms (I'm a finance major in Chicago) and I still can't land a god damn offer. Almost all the firms have not given me feedback. They just give me the same old b/s, it's a competitive process blah blah blah.\n\n3) I'm living at home with parents at the ripe age of 22. It hasn't been the coziest of living situations as my dad and I aren't getting along (mainly due to me not having a job). \n\nI never felt more alone in my life. For the first time in a long time I feel like I completely fucked up. I just feel like banging my head against wall for failing. I know I've had opportunities to change my job and ex-gf situation, but now I am sitting here realizing how hard I failed - at everything. It's the worst feeling in the world and it leaves it you feeling a little lost.

We don't live together, and haven't taken any serious steps to take our relationship to the next level. She talks about kids and marriage like they are an inevitability, but frankly I am very nervous about the idea.\n\nShe has confronted me a few times about a lack of intimacy on my part. She has told me that she feels like she's just my best friend, not my girlfriend, and I agreed to seek therapy about it. Between seeing 2 different therapists, they both honed in to the fact that I have had homosexual feelings since I was about 12 years of age, that I have long suppressed. I never felt like these feelings were true or valid, but as I get older and older I find it harder and harder to suppress them.\n\nMy therapists believe I may be gay, and have encouraged to share these feelings with my girlfriend, but I am **terrified** to do so. I know it will **crush** her, and I really don't want to hurt her. What makes it worse is the lack of confidence that I am gay. I've suppressed it for so long that I don't know what is real.

Never had a girlfriend before.  Generally i am a very shy and reserved person, especially around girls.  But recently i met a girl who i think i really like, and i would love to date her, but i need some advice first. \n\nHere are the details:  \n\nI work at a daycamp, she works there as well.  \nI can tell that she likes me, she smiles whenever she sees me and things like that.  \n\nMy reservations are as follows:  i think she may be considerably younger than I.  My guess would be that she is 17, maybe 18 which isnt bad at all, but she may be younger im not sure.  Should i try to find out her age?  Ask her about school or something like that?  \n\nAlso i had only really started talking to her just a few days ago.  I rarely get chances to see her.  She works inside all day, and im outside.  If i do get to see her, its usually just a passing smile and hello.  Ive only really gotten to have one legit sit down conversation with her, and it really annoys me every minute that i cant talk to her.  \n\nTo make matters worse i just left work this tuesday for the rest of the week to go to florida with my family, and every day that im not at work i cant help but seeing as days of wasted opportunities.  I just started getting to talk to her and then im suddenly gone for 5 days.  She doesnt know i went on vacation, i didnt get a chance to see her the day before i left.  \n\nHonestly i cannot stop thinking about her.  I plan to go back to work, find her, ask her about her weekend, and then tell her she has really pretty eyes or something like that.  Does that sound like a good plan?  Should i ask her out on a date?  Do people even do that anymore?  Lol, please any advice is greatly appreciated.  Not being able to see/talk to her until next week is killing me on the inside.

However, the aspect that really hurt us was we could never find time for each other due to our schedules, other than texting and Skyping.  It's common that we could only see each other once a month.  I've already posted the following somewhere else but here it goes:\n\nBackground infoL  I've been seeing her for over a year.  She moved year two years ago from the Philippines.  Our relationship was great except the fact we live two hours apart and our work schedules are not compatible. She is only off work during certain days of the the week and I'm only off work on weekends. \n\nHowever, we have reached a breaking point. We haven't physically seen each other in over 2 months and she begged me to come see her Tuesday and Wednesday when she was off work this week. I couldn't because I had to work and couldn't get off on such short notice. She has become very depressed (as well as upset and mad) as a result of this. It hurts me the most because I feel her depression is my fault.\n\nI have in the past, suggested many alternatives for this relationship to work. Changing her schedule or offering her to live with me so she can find work and we can live together. She always refused because her parents would not approve of it.\n\nI made a tough decision yesterday and let her go. We're two different people living two different lives that cannot be reconciled.  We cannot handle the distance and time apart from each other. I.e. her depression.\n\nSince the break-up, she is doing NC and it hurts really bad.  (Since she's not from the US she often needs help or guidance with things)  She's somehow convinced that I'm leaving her because I'm \"tired\" of her (Her past BFs did this to her).  I still love her but I know I can't prolong the situation any longer.  \n\nAny advice, input, support, or prayers would be appreciated.  Heart breaks are tough and I need to vent.\nTL;DR:"}

I met this man while on vacation about a year ago. We did long distance for a while, then decided we had had enough. I moved to him out of ease. And I was looking for a new adventure anyhow.\n\nWe moved in pretty quickly. We are very much in love. But I just discovered a lie that I feel is pretty hard to overlook. His ex is his boss at work, which I hadn't had any real feelings for at all. I mean, it's not the coolest. But it isn't exactly easy for him either, so I figured I shouldn't cause a stink and make it worse. Plus, I get cool chick points for not caring. He told me that they had stopped banging over two years ago anyway.\n\nSo today, he left his gmail open on my computer. I figured it was mine and was confused about why it said I had been talking to his ex (who is now his boss and they're in close proximity) so much. Realized quickly that it wasn't mine, but not before I saw a subject line that was quite sexual, about a month after I met him. He was clearly searching all of their history for some reason (don't care). What I'm really upset about is that he lied about how long ago they'd stopped being intimate. It appears that he actually stopped (hopefully as I didn't read them or look at any other subject line) right before he and I got intimate.\n\nI don't care so much about the skipping from one girl to the next as I care about the lie. I absolutely will not bring this up to him, because I'm not a snooper and I don't want him to think I am. So, I guess the question is this: How do I absorb this in a healthy and rational way? I feel a little sick about the lie, I want to continue to trust him. And I want him to continue to trust me so much that leaving his gmail open on my computer wasn't even an issue. What do?

Alcohol? for at least as long as my husband has known him (I don't know the details, don't really want to, I guess). He recently started going to some kind of unspecified meetings, and has been sober for about three months now. I am really proud of him! I hope he and I can start to get along in the future because of this, but that's material for another post.\n\nIn the course of making these life changes, he felt compelled to tell his son that he apparently had a girlfriend before his mom. As I understand it, my husband was born when his mother was very young (this is in part why he lives in another part of the country than his father, and why my knowledge of this is all a literal and figurative game of telephone). This relationship apparently also ended on an accidental pregnancy.\n\nMy husband is a ball of all sorts of confusing emotions over this. He's ecstatic, because he's always wanted a brother (he has a ton of step-brothers, but was basically raised like an only-child on weekdays). At the same time, all we know is that Father-in-law is the only person that knows this guy's identity. He has apparently been raised as someone else's son, and by father-in-law's account, is a happy adult with no reason to suspect. My Father-in-law supposedly met him a few times, but without saying anything about it, so it may be a family friend. I can't help but think *someone* else in his life or in my husband's extended family knows something, because my husband's family as insanely strong features (like, same face planted on different people. Christmas dinner with all the cousins was hilarious. At least to me.)\n\nAnyway, all I know for certain is that this guy lives in the same city where my husband was born, and we could probably find out his name if we asked.

However, they've completely torn apart the intersecting road, to redo it. So, there are two huge concrete barriers and two huge ROAD CLOSED signs. The stop signs, however, remains firmly in place. Well, naturally, given that there essentially is no other road to stop for, no one stops at that intersection. Well, on this particular day, there happened to be a cop stationed nearby. Frobozz, unaware of this, ran the sign like he would any other day. He was promptly pulled over and given a ticket. According to him, the officer stated, \"Son, if there's a stop sign, you stop...\" even if the other road is none-existent.\n\nThis actually made me pretty mad.

I tried to ignore it but when he threw a magazine I'd left on the counter in the kitchen at me I got pissed and I pick it up and threw it back at him and I see how he starts to look for something to throw so I push him into the freezer. He flips and launches at me but I push him into the table the table, he falls down (hes not very big...). He yells he gonna call the police and goes to a friends house.\n\nI think he scrubbed his elbow but nothing more and it would surprise me if he sued but its really beside the point because I really wish we had a good/better relationship, but at the same time I just cant take his constant abuse.\n\n(No point asking my mother for help, she never put the foot down ever and I was a spoiled brat as well until I was like 20 when I realized I could do much more to be a person that I wanted to be.)\nTL;DR:"}

We have been for a bit, and he is sooo good to me....   \n\nBut a few of my friends have been concerned about his attitude towards his child. We spoke a bit more about his ex and he said she pressured/pushed/tricked him into getting her pregnant (thought she was on birth control), though he had told her from the beginning he wasnt sure he wanted children.  \n\nHe said he never told her out right \"no\", but that he wasnt sure and thought it would be way into the future.  \n\nAnyway, she got accidentally pregnant, kept the baby, they fought for 2 years. He said she described him as a \"shitty person\" for not being a \"kid person.\" He told me he doesnt like gatherings with kids- like parties/outings. I think I heard from friends that he didnt help around enough, like diaper changes.  \n\nBut he speaks well of the child, says he loves it. Says he gives the child play time with him etc.   \n\nBut he wants his ex to have full custody, and he seems to only want to see her once a week for a couple hours. Honestly, I feel like he actually would want to see her less- but he's scared of admitting it to most people.  \n\nHas anyone had a similar situation like this? From any side?  \n\nA few people have pretty much said if he's a deadbeat dad then it does make him a crappy person... and I should care about it and think if he's crappy about his own child, what else crappy could he do?\nTL;DR:"}

What do I do?\nPOST: So, in February of 2010 when I was 16-17, I was the victim of a screwup at the pharmacy, which landed me in the hospital for about 4 days. I received a decent amount of money for a settlement for the screwup, and it was placed in a bank account with my mom's name on it, to be transfered to me when I turned 18. Starting in January, before my 18th birthday in March, my mother started behaving very nastily towards my father, and eventually filed a restraining order, saying he had become \"violent,\" and \"kicked in her door.\" I never saw any of this. He never raised a hand towards her, even though they argued frequently. He had been sleeping in the garage in the winter to avoid upsetting her, and was asking to sleep in the house. Turns out, she withdrew almost $5000 from *my* settlement money, to be used for college, to put a down payment on a divorce lawyer the next Monday. Now she's saying to the court that it was a \"loan,\" even though I wasn't even aware of it until months later. I think I'm going to press charges, but I figured I'd ask what everyone else thinks. Theres a lot more to the story I'm probably missing, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.\nTL;DR:"}

I constantly found myself saying \"Where have you been all of my life.\" She tells me that she is interested in one of our leads. We were both 18, he was 27. I hated the idea of it.  The two of them become friends with benefits and she tells me she found out he was 36. She doesn't seem to care though, she keeps fucking him.\n\nAfter a little while she starts \"cheating\" on him with me. I had no idea what I was supposed to do. All of my friends tell me to leave her alone and move on. So I did. After about 3 weeks she tells me that she ended things with our lead and that she misses me a lot. I was so happy, we got together 2 days later.\n\nAll we did was work, and then hang out with each other for a year and a half. She didn't like the fact that I had so many friends that were girls and she would get really jealous whenever I hung out with them. So I stopped.

They refuse to hire maintenance in their house so my boyfriend is the one installing their new toilets, new cabinets etc.  His parents are foreign but he was born here so I think that is partly why.

A few weeks ago I let it slip that a loved her, I've never truly loved a girl before so I didn't know what to expect. She responded with \"I love you too\" and things could not be better. \n\nLast week I started a conversation about sex. How can I improve, what does she like, what doesn't she like. Generic stuff.

I've asked her sex related questions before but nothing quite in depth.\n\nAnd ever since then I feel like she's been off with me, she's less responsive with texts doesn't want to see me on the weekends.\n \n\nI tried my best to make amends today by asking if everything is ok, and she kept responding with \"it's hard\" or \"i'm confused\". I've not been on the long term relationship scene ever. So I don't what to think. \n\nShe keeps saying stuff like \"I don't want to upset you\" or \"I feel like I don't give you the time you deserve\".

We have been dating for about three months. She ended up taking a long time in the bathroom and I had to empty my bladder. For the record, she lives in a small house that her parents bequeathed her. I asked her if I could piss outside and she said that it was gross but if I had to she wouldn't stop me. I went outside and peed at the base of a big tree in her backyard.\n\nWhen I came in she asked me if I had seen her grandmother's resting place. I was like...where was it? She said that it was at the base of the big tree and that her grandmother's ashes were under the plaque on the tree. Truth be told I did not even notice the plaque since I was pretty preoccupied with not pissing myself. Also, she didn't warn me that any such site was in her back yard. \n\nI felt horrible and told her that I had peed on the gravesite and she got (somewhat understandably) mad at me, saying that I had desecrated her grave. She thought it didn't make sense that I wouldn't have seen the sign and that I was stupid and disrespectful. I checked later and there is indeed a plaque but it is not a neon sign. Someone in distress could definitely overlook it. So basically the argument is that she thinks that my carelessness resulted in a really disrespectful action and I think that my momentary oversight caused an unfortunate incident.\n\nAfter the incident she was really distraught since desecrating graves is a big deal in her religion. She didn't want to go out anymore and asked me to leave. Since that time she hasn't texted me back (~2 days ago) in response to my apology. Should I do more or just let her alone? I don't want to push her too hard but I do think there is a degree of overreaction due to the circumstances.\nTL;DR:"}

Now I'm not sure where to go from there.\nPOST: I apologize in advance if I posted in the wrong sub.\n\n**Background**  \nI've always been a shy guy with little confidence so having a crush on someone all throughout high school was difficult. We've known each other since kindergarten but she was part of the popular group, and I obviously was not. I was too self-conscious to say anything to her so nothing developed.\n\n**Couple Days Ago**  \nFast forward four years, I was thinking about my high school days and thought about her. My confidence has improved since then so I all of a sudden decided to message her through Facebook and tell her I how felt at the time. She responded, saying she was glad I told her and that I made her day with the message. I asked if she would like to stay in touch and she said said yes; so we added each other on Facebook. I felt so happy.\n\nI haven't messaged her since then because I don't want to come off as too clingy. I would eventually like to ask if she wants to hang out sometime and catch up. But since I've never really talked with her, I'm having a hard time trying to come up with a good conversation (I have a hard time socializing with people). Not to mention all the group photos of her with other guys is a bit discouraging. What do you guys think is a good approach?\nTL;DR:"}

A couple of weeks after meeting, we started going out on dates. A month later, we were \"official\". I was very laid back about the whole thing after experiencing relationships that I was emotionally invested in too soon. I was ready for a real, long term , mature relationship that grew slowly and naturally.\n\nMy boyfriend is a therapist and is used to discussing things as elaborately as possible, which I like because I feel like having open communication with your partner is important. This past weekend he felt like I wasn't being open with him about my feelings. I have been very open about us, but I get the sense he wants me to be more intense than I really am. He basically just wanted to check in on where we were. He admitted to being further along in relationships at this point and understands I want to take things slowly. He also admitted to dating people who he felt he had to fix and liked me because I was stable. But I get the sense he's trying to find something in me to work on.\n\nI'm worried that maybe we're just not compatible and he wants to manipulate our relationship into his ideal of what it should be like. I was very upfront about who I am and what my long term goals are since the beginning and I think maybe he was overlooking some things about me just so he can be with someone. Can anyone help me figure out where this is going?\nTL;DR:"}

So I decided to ask her by using this inside joke we had with a teddy bear. So I went to build a bear because (surprisingly) I was having difficulty finding a normal looking teddy bear to ask her. So grudgingly I go to build a bear looking super out of place feeling really awkward just trying to buy a damn bear. So the next school day I wait before classes when we usually talk to ask her, and everyone is asking me \"what I have in the bag?\" So I show them and every one says good luck and stuff when my \"friend\" Vince walks up and sees that I was going to ask her out. So later I see him talking on the phone I immediately think he might be calling her, but then I think that's ridiculous and calm myself down. Little did I know she was sick that day. And the next day. And the next. So for three days I sit there in the morning with that bag waiting for her. Then one day I see her at lunch and present her with the bear and everything asking her. WELLLL it turns out he did call her that morning. Leaving me embarrassed in front of all of our friends. And as a bonus didn't tell me that he all ready asked her,  leaving me day after day waiting for her and embarrass myself in font of everyone. So when I tell people about this I have no trouble with them believing me, but they do go \"well he did ask her first and that's all that matter\" Or \"you gotta give him props for being quick\" that's bullshit he could have told me and not left me to feel the worst rejection of my life! \n\nAny way Reddit what is the worst thing that others don't think was that bad that happened to you?\nTL;DR:"}

The girl I love is in a relationship.\n\nNow before anyone says, well talk to her, there's another problem: She (15 F) is in a relationship with a guy in college (19 M) and he's abusive.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [20 M] have been dating my girlfriend [20 F] for over half a year, during this time she has been progressively gaining weight. I want to say something but she used to be anorexic and i don't know what to do\nPOST: So when I first met my girlfriend she was at a healthy weight. However as I soon found out this wasn't always the case. Just months prior to me meeting her, she was very underweight due to anorexia; she showed me pictures and it was bad, she didn't even look like herself. As we began dating this was something she was still recovering from. She was eating, but had great difficulty doing so around other people, especially when in public. Over time she got used to eating around me, and though she still gets a little uncomfortable, she has a better time eating around others now.\n\nThe problem is as we have been dating, she has been steadily gaining weight. I initially thought that this was temporary due to her finally eating at a healthy rate and that she would see that she needed to get control of her eating habits and her weight gain would stop. This however, did not happen. I didn't want to say anything because I believed this to be a sensitive issue, and something that she needed to deal with on her own. I was also cautious about her anorexia as she was finally coming into a position where she was comfortable about how she looked and I didn't want to upset that.\n\nNow however, to be frank, I'm losing my attraction to her. I feel bad, because the relationship has been great and I really enjoy being with her. Despite this, I don't find the weight she has put on as attractive. I recognize the shallowness of such a statement, but its how I feel, and I can't really stop it. In addition I don't like watching someone allow themselves to become unhealthy. I want to do something to help her, but I'm paralyzed. I'm terrified that she might slip back into anorexia.\n\nI don't know what to do. How do I bring such a subject up to her? She is a really sensitive person and when she receives any kind of criticism she just folds up. How can I talk about this with her without hurting her? Should I even bring it up?\nTL;DR:"}

When we were done, I felt really weird about it and told her that I didn't think I was ready for a relationship (which is what we both want, ultimately). We stopped talking for almost a week, but then I picked it back up because I found that I missed talking to her. \n\nShe's back in town now, and we have a date set up for next week. Last night we actually started getting pretty flirty and talked a bit about our sexual views, but nothing actually happened.

She's undiagnosed, because she refuses to see a therapist. She's afraid of looking crazy before people.\n\nI've tried talking to her about this, but this is kind of a touchy subject. She knows she has a lot of issues and that her reactions to some minor issues are not normal. I can handle the mood swings and whatnot, but her refusal to seek professional help has caused me to think she's becoming resigned - \"he can handle it, so there is no need to get better\", or something like that. \n\nThis has been bothering me a lot lately.

There are three significant parties: Me, my ex, and my ex's parents. I'm a 23 year old male and she is 23 as well. I guess I'm a bit confused with how it should end.\n\nMy ex and I mutually and officially called it off as a couple after some talks in a brunch diner, but we were still attached to the point that we agreed on a friends-with-benefits deal while putting the management of our careers first and foremost before our relationship. We had a distance relationship going-- I wouldn't say long since we were physically only about 2-3 hours away from each other, since I went to school out of the \"Big City\". \n\nThese are the weaknesses that I've encountered at the moment, and I would appreciate your insight:\n\nSex is a hard thing to give up with her, since we had no qualms on both sides about it. However, I was more supportive to abstain from all sex altogether since it would only be hurting us on the long run, and that I felt it was unfair to me since I felt I was getting the short end of the stick. It was also unfair to potential girlfriends if I was screwing my ex while dating or attempting to date another woman.\n\nWe agreed that we would be close friends, and in my mind, repackaged the whole relationship to be identical to a relationship that would break if one of us found someone else, but in the meanwhile would be a kind of \"limbo\" relationship. We would do things together, like eat out, have fun, etc. like a couple, but the main reason why this would have any benefit at all would be the effect of \"protecting me from her parents\" according to my ex. \n\nI didn't want to close the door on us, and we both wanted to leave the door open into the future to be together again if circumstances changed.\nTL;DR:"}

He is however, a Jr. black belt in tae kwan do and has worked hard at it for over 3 years. He has to break a board as part of the test and is given 2 board choices. 1 board is as thin as a pencil and as big as a piece of paper. The other is about as thick as a thumb and the size of an average envelope. They have him try on the thicker one, but eventually move to the thin one and just place it up higher when breaking. Here is where the problem is. The same thing happens over and over again before every belt test. He gets very anxious about the board breaking and the night before he always screams he wants to quit.\nThe frustration on my part is that when we practice with a kicking pad, he nearly knocks it out of my hand with his strength. He has no problem generating enough power to break 2-3 thicker boards stacked together. However, the second I bring the board out he holds back or goes through the motion and misses intentionally. He won't give me a straight answer why and I explain I'm not mad, I just want to help.\n\nHere is where it gets even more frustrating. The day of the test comes around and he tries it with the thin board and brakes it with ease on the first try. (seriously these boards will break if you look at them wrong). After that he loves Tae Kwan do and says he will be in it for life. Also, his masters and I have both tried this. We have the pad out and as he kicks we quickly change it to the thick board and he smashes right through it no problem. He even says it didn't hurt and he is so proud of himself. Still, if we take another thick board out he goes back to his missing on purpose and then wanting to quit.\n\nIt's frustrating and I was wondering if anyone had any advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I've never had a serious relationship like this, just a fling here and there. We have been great together up until a month ago.\n\nRecently, she has been really depressed. Says she is gaining weight (I can't see it, and I tell her how beautiful I think she is), thinks everything in her life is going wrong and that shes bad at everthing, always sleeping, etc. I always try to get her to cheer up. \n\nRecently, however, nothing seems to help. Now she is putting the blame on me. She near-daily asks why I hate her in a cute voice, but when I chuckle and tell her how perfect I think she is, she tells me to stop laughing at her and stop lying to her. I am not lying! I genuinely think she is gorgeous and amazing. We have been having heated debates where it is usually me trying to show her how much I love her, and trying to make her happy. \n\nI know it sounds like our relationship has run its course, but when shes not in her depressed mood we are having an amazing time. Snowboarding, playing video games together, going on dates, and loving every second of it.\n\n Out of nowhere, though, I'll suddenly get no response in texts or one word answers. If we are together, she turns her shoulder and sleeps or goes on her phone and doesn't want to talk to me. \n\nOur most recent \"issue\" was her saying I never plan anything anymore. I always expect her to make the plans and never decide anything for myself (thats her side). I try to tell her that I'm like that because I am afraid of disappointing her or making her unhappy. I try to let her know her happiness is the most important thing to me.\nTL;DR:"}

She put me to bed and as we were kissing goodnight (I was beyond blacked out at this point. She actually told me this) called her my friend's name. I am so ashamed right now. We've talked and cried and I apologized, but as our relationship is rather new and she has major trust issues from previous infidelities in other relationships, I can't stop agonizing over my shitty decision-making.

She's not putting any kind of pressure on me. I know it would make Mom and Grandma so happy for her to meet him before she dies.

Later that night I was walking to the front with another girl near me and she jokingly said something like \"back off he's my friend!\" to the other girl. I caught her staring at me, maybe... she seemed to be kind of zoned out and maybe just happened to be looking at me when it happened. She also made a comment that I have nice big eyes. Anyway, that is the jist of the first night.\n\nMy other question is if there is a too young? She looks pretty young, like 18 or 19.

Later she blocked me from FB, her phone and even ignored me from school.

Eventually I had to go to work, no sign of the UPS guy. 15 minutes after I get there I check my phone, Delivered Left On Doorstep. No. No! Why didnt they need a signature for it? I have no options. I finally get out of work at 1 a.m and there is nothing on my doorstep. :C The customer service number closes at 12 a.m. And all I have as far as internet goes is this potato phone. So now I'm just anxiously awaiting the morning to call UPS or ask my damn neighbors if they got my package by accident, The only skateboards in my area are those repulsive cruisers and weird shaped shit you can't do fip tricks or like anything on.

After 6 months I trusted him so I agreed to be monogamous and not use condoms. One day he fell asleep w his phone on his stomach. I picked it up w intent of setting it on the bed side table. I admit I was being nosy and started looking at his pics and texts. I found out that I was just one of many women he was f---ing. To make it even worse, he was married to one of the women! No, I didn't know he was married and I broke things off immediately. I think his wife deserves to know what her husband is doing. Not only is it betrayal but he is putting her health at risk. Their home number and address are in the phone book so I could contact her that way. My worries are 1. am I only wanting to tell her because I am so hurt by his lies? 2. what if word gets out in our small community, that I have been sleeping with a married man. 3. Is the wife going to take her anger out on me? and 4. I worry he will know it was me who told and retaliate in some way\nTL;DR:"}

She used to have terrible experiences with her period (bad migraines). She saw her doctor and they gave her an IUD. It has worked wonders for her period. Now she experiences very little, if any, complications associated with her monthly cycle. At first I was very happy about this, knowing that she would no longer have these physical complications.\n\nHowever, it has eliminated her sex drive. Completely. Its gone. We've had sex *maybe* 10 times in the last 18 months. I don't even know how to initiate sex with her any longer.\n\nEach time I bring this up, she gets upset and cries, stating that she realizes this is an issue and feels guilty about it. She promises to make an appoint with her doctor, the first promise coming about 15 months ago. It hasn't happened yet. I told her that I'd even pay for an alternative out of my own pocket. Cost isn't an issue.\n\nThis is still an issue and nothing has changed.\n\nI feel conflicted. One part of me feels like a selfish jerk for wanting her to sacrifice some of her own physical comfort for my desire to have sex.\n\nOn the other hand, this has been going on for a while. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. She still likes to cuddle and what not, but each time she does that, I almost want to push her off, so she can feel the same type of rejection that I have. I don't feel desired physically at all any longer.\n\nI have no idea what to do. It scares the shit of out me that I am losing faith in this relationship, and quickly. I want this to work. I also feel like a total asshole for thinking that my unmet need for something like sex could end a relationship on my half.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. As I type this, I'm almost in tears as this is just tearing me apart inside, while she sits on the couch talking to her mom on the phone and saying that everything is just wonderful.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: Living conditions terrible at home, under age of majority for my state, what are my options?\nPOST: Wall of text, sorry...\n\nI'm 20 years old, currently living with my grandmother as I have for basically my entire life.  When I was around 12, my grandparents legally adopted me and my two cousins (one same age, other is recently 13).  My grandfather passed away about 3 years ago, and since then, my grandmother's mental health has just been sharply declining.  Right now, the living conditions of the house are pretty unbearable.  The air is basically all cigarette smoke from my grandmother's chain-smoking (people ask me all the time if I smoke because I smell like an ash tray), there's mold in the bathroom (and probably in the roof.. attic? after having some kind of infestation) that she refuses to do anything about, there's hardly ever any food in the house, the place is NEVER cleaned (I try, but it's always trashed in a matter of hours), and now there's an unbearable flea infestation that she simply ignores - and the dogs are in awful shape, too.  I don't make enough money to live on my own.  I just recently got a raise up to $9.50 an hour, and I work about 32 hours a week.  Between insurance and my actual car note, I have $355 a month to pay for my car and $50 for my phone.  I'm in the process of looking for a second job so that I can try to support myself, but so far, having a job already is an issue for most employers I've talked to.\n\nAge of majority in my state is 21, which I will be in November.  However, another 5 months of dealing with fleas and the constant fear of an asthma attack from the mold and cigarettes is unbearable.  Since I was legally adopted and there is a 13-year-old living in the house (again, also adopted), should I contact DHS or something?  I don't really have anyone I could become roommates with, as pretty much all of my friends are moving out of state or several hours away from here to pursue other jobs or continuing their education.\nTL;DR:"}

He's my own boyfriend and I love him so much, we've been together a year and a half, yet I find myself blocking him online sometimes just so he can't make me feel any worse. Almost anything he says at this point will upset me because it is never an apology, so I try not to hear it when I'm too fragile.\n\nWe're in separate countries and I'm sure if we lived together or even nearby it would be different. But as it is, communication is limited and when I get really sad I have the option of expressing it over text/expensive phone calls/ poor quality skype, which either makes him sad or he misinterprets it as anger, and so he gets angry, or I just stop talking to him, retreat and beat myself up for the rest of the day/weekend whatever. \n\nIt sounds like we have communication issues, but there's only so many times you can discuss something and come up empty handed before you stop discussing it. He wants to help, but he's only human too and can't help but be frustrated by it. \n\nI don't want to take things out on on him, or myself. I want to not get so upset by little things in the first place.\n\nI feel like I think too deep on things and get too worked up about this relationship to not handle minor incidents really badly and it's jeopardising our relationship. \n\nUpsetting things are stuff like: taking an hour or two to reply or texts when he's with friends 5 or 6 nights a week, forgetting to text me when I ask, not making effort to find out when he's free/book flights/save money to see each other... \n\nAlso his response to arguments is often to stop talking to me altogether. He knows I have a history with self harm so I can't imagine why he thinks it's okay to leave me to wallow even when I reach out to him.\nTL;DR:"}

Not to me, not to anyone. \n\nWe have discussed it calmly, we have fought about it, I have written him a letter. I have told him I don't have to have a big wedding, that I will sign a pre nup, etc. Basically I have tried to get to the bottom of why he doesn't want to get married, but he's stonewalled me every time. Apart from to say 'if you still want to get married when we are 40, we can do it' \n\nI've spent the weekend really thinking about it, and I've made up my mind that I'm leaving. I'm leaving because I'm tired of always having things his way. He's completely inflexible, to what movie we go to see, to what we have for dinner. If he doesn't get his way, he can sulk, and makes it perfectly clear to me (and anyone else who is around) that he doesn't want to be there. I'm a pretty easy going person, and I'm usually quite happy to let him have what he wants. But this I can't budge on. \n\nI want you all to know that he is at his heart, a very kind and good man. He's funny and very smart, but he's just so stuck in his ways and stubborn, that it appears there's no room for me and what I want in this relationship anymore. \n\nAnyway my question is, he is going away for the weekend next month,  on his brothers bucks weekend, and I'm thinking if just moving out while he's gone and not saying goodbye. Would this be a terrible thing to do? \n\nMy reasons for this are because I know if I do it while he is here, he will shut down and give me absolutely nothing. Which is probably going to hurt me even more. I just don't want to face it. \n\nAm I a horrible person for thinking of leaving this way? And do you think I will regret not saying goodbye etc?

He is completely perfect and wonderful to me, and while we have an otherwise good, healthy, open relationship and have talked about a longer term commitment. However, I feel like it's unfair to him to keep him in a relationship where I'm not totally, 100 percent honest with him, as I assume he is with me. I don't know whether to tell him and risk losing him, or to just try to quietly resolve this issue with my therapist and just keep going as is.

I've told my husband I like being complimented, especially if I did something big. For example, I hadn't gotten my drivers license for the longest time. My husband was the primary motivator for me getting it (like, when we have kids, I'll have to take them to places since he will be working)- it took me three years and three tries before I got it. For everyone else, they complimented me and told me I did well. My husband basically dismissed it like \"I know, you already said you were going to get it\". \n\nI know he doesn't like being effusive. But it's to the point where it feels like I'm cheating on him emotionally to be complimented by other people. It makes me feel really awful, since I just get so happy, and then I automatically feel terrible since he doesn't do that for me. I've tried to tell him compliments and praise are a big positive motivator for me to do things. If I do something well, and someone compliments me, I will do it consistently.

My boyfriend ended up with a concussion and his roommate with a broken his nose.  \n\nSince then I've tried being nice and funny to him whenever he was around while I was at my boyfriend's apartment, and I thought he was growing on me but the other night I over heard my boyfriend on the phone with him and he was telling my boyfriend about a party he was at and to \"come but don't bring *her* you know I hate *her*\" talking about me. \n\nThis makes me extremely uncomfortable.  My boyfriend lives with someone who actively tries to get him to dump me. Not to mention I feel really awkward being at my boyfriend's apartment because it's his roommates apartment too and I don't want to be somewhere i'm not welcome. I don't want to be the kind of girl that makes her boyfriend stop being friends with his friends, but I'm really close to telling him he shouldn't be friends with his roommate if he doesn't support our relationship.  I've talked to him about it before and he knows how upset it makes me, but he tells me not to worry about it and it doesn't make a difference what his roommate thinks. All of his other friends like me and we get along really well. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I talk to the roommate? Should I keep trying to get him to like me? Or should I talk to my boyfriend and put an end to the friendship?\nTL;DR:"}

He only worked there for a month or two before he got a real job and moved out of town (he already graduated from college, and I'm still working on my degree). I was very interested in him, he's cute, funny, smart, etc. We only talked a few times, but I guess I left an impression because a few months went by (October) and he added me on facebook. I wanted to message him, but was too nervous.\n\nFast forward to April and he messaged me. We just made small talk, but I got the idea that he was interested. So last Saturday around midnight, he messages me and says he's in town and we should hangout. I couldn't resist so he came over to my place and we watched a movie. The movie he chose wasn't all the interesting so he mentioned that next time he would get something better. He initiated cuddling and ended up staying the night with me, but we didn't have sex because I didn't want to. I'm not into having sex with people I'm not in a relationship with. He said he was cool with not having sex and that it was actually just nice lying with me. The furthest we went was just making out hardcore and some slight touching of certain areas. \n\nHe left the next morning and I felt that we were on good terms. We don't communicate very much though, and when we do it's usually pretty short. I'm just not sure if he is only interested in me because he wanted to have sex with me, or if he wants something more, but if he did just want sex then why would he mention the possibility of us hanging out again? I've texted him since then, but like I mentioned our conversations are pretty brief. I don't want to make things awkward, but I want to know! Should I just ask him what he wants? I don't want to scare him off though? Or should I just wait this out.\nTL;DR:"}

I went down to the beach this morning, with snorkel equipment, to swim to a small sea-cave located 200m or so from the beach. To get there you swim through a reef and have to make several turns. I swim  100m out and see a small 3cm jellyfish. I flipped out, and being the coward I am, swim back to safety. I sat on the beach for 15 minutes thinking what a coward I am and swim back towards the cave to prove that I am **manly**. As I approached the area I saw the tiny jellyfish, I stop and look around for it. **BIG MISTAKE**.  I look down and see a MASSIVE 2m jellyfish and as I look around and see another 8/9 jellyfish the smallest 2cm the largest easily 2.5 meters, I freak out, if that is appropriate to describe my fit of terror, I find myself unable to move and see the jellyfish below me swim up and see its tentacles glide along my skin. A few seconds later I begin to yell, it felt/feels like being burnt alive, luckily before another one could assault me a passing rowing boat heard my terror and picked me up, took me to shore where the bar had some anti-hestimene luckily. It still hurts like hell.\nTL;DR:"}

I initiated the breakup because after doing a little soul searching, I had realized that she is a compulsive liar and that's something that I couldn't live with. I also came to the conclusion that we were far too wrapped up in being in a relationship that it hindered us from bettering ourselves. \n\nThe breakup was sudden but overall has been extremely civil. No fighting or saying things that are hurtful. Instead, we actually act like good friends. She has since moved away to pursue personal endeavors but we chat regularly. This is where my confusion comes in.\n\nIn our last chat, she nearly breaks down and cries asking if I ever loved her. Which I honestly tell her that I did. Realistically, I still do but things have been done that can't be easily undone. Then there's the whole trust issue that I have with her.\n\nI've moved on with my life and have dated a couple other people but have yet to find anything substantial. Mostly just crushes or being thrown into the friend-zone. I'm afraid that my loneliness might block my better judgement and I find myself taking back my ex for less than good reasons.  \n\nSo my questions are this:\nAre these feelings she's emoting genuine?\nAre they a sign that she wants me back?\nCan people like her (compulsive liars) change?\nIf so, should I consider taking her back?\nTL;DR:"}

I thought about it for some time now, and the more I think about him and I tying the knot, the more unsure and confused I am about the idea. I'm 21 and I've barely talked to people in healthy marriages in depth about it. I come from a long line of divorces and miserable marriages, and virtually none of my friends are married.\n\nSo my married Redditors, I need some comprehensive advice. Some of the questions I have are:\n\n* Someone once told me that \"you just know.\" Is such a thing true? Is there a light that immediately goes off in your head?\n* I love him to death, and I like the idea of marrying him, but my intuition is that now's not the right time. I believe love grows, but if I don't feel that way now, will I ever?\n* I'm worried about the \"people-change\" excuse. People do change, so I can't preclude the chance of him and I just growing apart. What qualities in a relationship indicate such a problem will definitely/never happen?\n* My boyfriend cheated on me once upon a drunken time 2 1/2 years ago. Never a problem since, BUT \"once a cheater, always a cheater,\" right? Is this a deal-breaker or not an issue at all? Or is cheating a reality of marriage?\n* People get married for stupid reasons, but what would be a matured and learned reason to get married? What's a superficial reason to get married?\n* What's this love-at-first-sight thing that's so hyped about? Any contrary or concurring experiences?\n* Lastly, any related insight would be much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

At that time, I was going to a private school and my mom, as usual, was driving my sister and I to school in the morning before work. We were at a crowded intersection and we were turning left (the traffic light was late yellow) when all of a sudden this huge black GMC truck slams into our Volvo going at like 80km/h (50mph) in a 60km/h zone. I would assume the driver sped up to make the light, but anyways, I was sitting in the backseat and my sister was sitting in shotgun. I saw the truck coming at me and I seriously swear everything was at a standstill...I closed my eyes and I shut them and braced for impact. Worst feeling ever, got shaken around and slammed my head against the window and but it didn't crack. I opened my eyes and my mom was bleeding from her head and she kept asking my sister and I if we were okay. It turned out in those last few seconds before impact, my mom managed to turn the car a bit thus, avoiding my sister and I getting directly hit (as we were sitting on the right side of the car). My mom got a spinal & neck injury (her face was a bit scarred, but it's almost unnoticeable now), but she can't walk or stand for long periods and she always avoids making left turns and that particular intersection. It turned out I was quite well and got away with only a bruise from the seat belt. My sister had to stay in the hospital along with my mom for a while, whereas my mom forced me to go to school and I only missed first period of class.

Reaching breaking point and unsure what to do next.\nPOST: Context: Me and my Ex get along really well, we've a lot in common and I've never connected with someone like I have with him. We broke up over a year ago mostly due to bad timing, location and because he wasn't ready to commit. We foolishly agreed to remain friendly which has lead to this sporadic relationship where we are in contact on and off, sometimes monthly, often more. I haven't been able to move on and still care deeply about him. It has reached breaking point where we know we can't continue like this. He knows he's being selfish, yet seems to care about me and wants me in his life. I think we could be great together but I feel he hasn't changed his mind about a relationship right now. I somewhat agree as I think we are both young right now and have our own things going on. But is it possible that two people are just right for eachother? I fear that the only solution right now is to break contact altogether but I don't want to lose him. \nI guess I would like some insight from someone who has gone through this, or could maybe give me an idea of what he might be thinking. Why would you keep in contact with an ex? Is he just trying to have the best of both worlds and am I being foolish by letting him?\nTL;DR:"}

I worked up the balls to ask her to homecoming and she said yes. We had a great time but I pussied out and didn't make a move. Fast forward a few months and it looks like I missed my chance, she started dating someone else. Oh well, I moved on.\n\nFast forward again to now, she is visiting me and our mutual friend at college. We have been texting and giving each other calls consistently over these first few months of college (frequently when we are both very drunk). Now she is here and we have arrangements to eat dinner at my dining hall with our friend. I thought I would take some initiative and invite her to come check out my dorm room and chill for a bit after dinner. She responded with \"Yeeeees!\" I think that is a good sign?

I don't know if it's really a \"quarter life crisis\" but anyway...\n\nShe previously studied at university from the age 18 for four years for a degree that offered no work, so she has gone back to uni and has 2 more years of her current degree to go. \n\nAnyway, she is turning 24 soon and she seems to be obsessed with her age. She's anxious because she wants to have been working already and stuff like that. She was crying the other day because she couldn't find work after her previous degree and has had to change her profession.\n\nWe have planned a trip to Europe this year for a tour designed for 18-39 year olds and she's worried that everyone will be younger than her. I keep on telling her that it doesn't matter what age they are.\n\nand she keeps on worrying that she's not attractive anymore and obsessing about getting older. She points out wrinkles on her face which are barely wrinkles really lol and is obsessed with it. She seems to think that I'm going to waltz off with some 21 year old or something which I do not want to do even if I was single. She also compares past photos of herself to now. Someone called her \"lady\" the other day and someone asked her if she had kids and she was really upset by this. Agh!\n\n**But the most worrying part is: She's not sleeping much, she's quiet and she's not eating much. I am really hurting because I don't know how I can help her. I just want my girlfriend back...** \n\nShe's always been a pretty nervous person but I think she has been actually having some panic attacks lately. It's scary. \n\nI'm not sure what it is. Is she scared of failure? Is it body dysmorphia? Is she just depressed? She has never been like this. I just want to make her better.\nTL;DR:"}

Our relationship was great until july. We hardly ever argued, it was all fun and games and then I went on vacation and we couldn't talk during summer... and when school started, it was all fights all the time. Last november, he decided that we should break up before we ended up hating each other. And I agreed for a day... but the next day at school was unbearable so I came crying to him and he felt bad and took me back....... that wasn't my goal but it made me happy. We saw each other once over christmas break and we had a great time. Then I was worried that I had gotten pregnant and I was too afraid to tell him so I bitched at him for a few days... and his parents told him that they thought I was trapping him and that he was unhappy and stressed out and the suggested we break it off.. so we talked and, in the end, I got my way with staying together till my last final exam because I know that I can't take the stress of being newly single and writing exams.\n\nNow it just works out that we're together for our anniversary... and he also told me that he might stay with me anyways.\n\nAnd I'm sad. Not because I'm losing my boyfriend... because I know that the only thing that matters to me is his happiness. I know that I have to let him live his life and I can't depend on him. I know that I will always love him and that he'll always hold a place in my heart and I'm scared that he'll get over me in the blink of an eye. He's my best friend and the love of my life and it hurts so much to let him go and I know that I probably will have to... and I'm scared I'll  never love someone like I loved him.\nTL;DR:"}

Did you regret it?\nPOST: I am 17 years old and soon to graduate high school. I'm really worried about what I want to major in. I have my passion, but everyone is telling me to pursue something else. Let me sum up my academics first. This is going to seem like bragging, so that's why I did it on a throwaway. I honestly am just giving this information so you understand why I am being urged to not major in what I want to.\n\n* I scored one point from a perfect score on my ACT (35/36)\n* My GPA for my senior year thus far, *unweighted*, is a 98.7\n* I am graduating high school with 47 college credits.\n* My regents grades (NYS Standardized Testing) average out to a 98. (one of the highest in NYS)\n* I was homeschooled until 9th grade and I could have graduated at 15 if I hadn't decided to go to public school.\n* I love to learn in all academic areas, but I prefer to read up on my own, or collaborate with peers, rather than learning in a class with many individuals who seem to only care about getting a good grade, rather than the actual material.\n\nNow here's my dilemma: I want to major in theatre studies. It's my passion and it always has been. I cannot see myself ever giving it up. It is completely unfathomable to myself for me to leave this avenue. I applied to four Ivy Leagues and many other high-end colleges and everyone is attempting to get me to major in pre-med or pre-law or chemical engineering. As much as I know I could excel in these areas, and that I would enjoy learning, I cannot shake off my passion for theatre. As it is, I am planning on a dual major, but even my guidance counselors at school are telling me to drop theatre studies to a minor. I'm really worried about having to give up my greatest passion. Did any of you pursue an academic field in which you had little interest in order to pursue practicality? Or did any of you pursue your passion and regret it? I'd love to hear all stories.\nTL;DR:"}

What started as just me looking to possibly hookup or go on a date with someone over Tinder turned into me meeting my girlfriend. We've been dating for a bit over a month now (I know; not very long) but the time and dates we've spent together have been the romantic moments of my life. Ice cream and kissing under the moon on a bench next to a water fountain, hiking and having a picnic to take in the view, you name it. This girl is intelligent, funny, and drop dead gorgeous.  \n\nNow. On to the problem. In a little under a month or so she will be leaving to university that is about a 4 hour drive away to attend school full time. I currently work and go to school at a community college to transfer after associates. I've read many of the similar posts regarding long distance relationships on this subreddit which have advised to stay friends, make things work while keeping in contact, etc. For a 4 hour drive and with me being able to transfer in a year I feel like this would be manageable for a LDR. However, I know that she will probably want to indulge in the social activities of university and I don't want to hold her back. There is also the case of her discovering things about herself and meeting other people there.\n\nCurrently we are planning a weekend beach trip with each other and making our time well spent before she goes. We have yet to discuss this very much although she seems very open to the idea of a LDR as she will be trying to drive back up once a month not including holidays and such.

Help me deal with it?\nPOST: Okay, sorry if the title is weird and vague, I want to stay anonymous. So, let me try not to write a novel here. My SO is an extravert who gets stimulated easily and when enthousiastic he gets very loud and talks over people. It's very obvious that when we're in a group we have a very different dynamic, I tend to sit back and wait for (what I feel are) appropriate pauses in conversation to add my thoughts, while he is very spontaneous and will probably talk loudly over the end of your sentence. Part of it can be endearing.\n\nLet me be clear: I am not asking for ways to alter his behaviour. His behaviour is not the problem. My reaction to it is.\n\nI am a bit of a sponge. I will very easily absorb the \"energy\" people bring to a conversation and I tend to do better with people who are kinda calm. When my SO gets as energetic as he does, it can cause a bit of distress in me and I will jolt and wince when he gets loud or when I feel he's being too \"present\" in the conversation. In my worst moments I will actually shush him or grab him and it makes me feel like a total douche. I really want to unlearn this behaviour and was hoping someone could give me some tips. I know I can't just change either of our dynamics (that's not really what I'm asking for), but I was hoping some of you who are in similar situations could give me pointers as to how to let it go, or recognise it early on so I can counter my reaction with.. something?\n\nBonus: I only have that reaction when in group. When he's just being energetic around me I can get a little nervous, but there's way less distress and no shushing.\n\nThanks for thinking along with me.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel calmer and more at ease when I do.\n\nMaybe related: I have really severe anxiety issues, and have been also mentally healing from a traumatizing break-in situation from a while ago.

We went on a few dates and since everything seemed to be going well, I decided to introduce her to my friends at a booze cruise (traveling around the city harbor in a yacht) birthday for a friend. When we arrived I realized that there were a lot more people than I was expecting, most of whom were acquaintances. I introduced her to my main group of friends who were in a circle, and entertained the occasional handshake from acquaintances who did not join our circle. \n\nShe had fun at the party, but later confided that I had hurt her feelings by not introducing her to everyone I talked to. I was unprepared for this response, and my immediate reaction was rationalize, explain my intention, and otherwise gloss over her feelings. We got into a fight about my reaction, and later she decided that she couldnt trust me with her feelings and emotions which led to a decision to stop dating. \n\nThe thing is, I realize this has always been how I responded when a partner has said I hurt their feelings. I usually try to explain that my intentions were good and that it was a missed signal or something I innocently overlooked, however that never gets me anywhere. What is the appropriate response when a partner says their feelings are hurt, and why do I feel the need to rationalize and try to get myself off the hook?

Whenever I ejaculate (given some 24-hour recharge), I easily clear about 3-4 times the average (I can provide numbers if necessary but whatever).\n\nI produce a lot less if I have less recharge, but this requires me to have sex fairly frequently, which is difficult because my sex drive is not sufficiently high to match that.\n\nSo this leads me to my problem. Whenever I find myself in a new relationship, it never lasts very long. I really happen to enjoy oral sex, and I love ejaculating in a girl's mouth, but the problem is that almost nobody can stand it. Even girls who are normally okay with oral sex have a really difficult time taking in that much ejaculate.\n\nI'm not really sure if there's something I can do to lower my volume or if it's simply a matter of \"find the right girl.\" It's been a problem for me in virtually every relationship I've ever been in (the longest being about a year, the other three being anywhere from a month to 7 months). My current girlfriend and I have been going out for about 5 months and we've already run into this issue several times. \n\nWe have intercourse plenty often, but oral sex is what really tends to rev my engine, so to speak. I honestly wish I didn't enjoy it so much, because it tends to really ruin the experience for the other person. I cannot count the number of times when the other person has had to pull away violently, coughing and gagging, because it's simply too much.\n\nIt's becoming a real and serious problem for me and whenever I talk about it to my friends IRL, they all laugh at me and act like I'm just trying to brag. I'm not sure what else to do.\nTL;DR:"}

Why not be single for a time?\n\nAs much as I look forward to meeting a new, wonderful woman who I can become romantic with I am committed to letting it happen naturally.  I am not looking for dates and sex simply because after 3 years of being in a relationship I feel it is important to regain my footing as a single person... I need time to heal from this nightmare of a relationship and (in my opinion) she could stand to take some time developing herself and becoming more secure in her own personal identity.  Her dating life is no longer any of my business, but the fact that she is so readily seeing other guys is wearing on my conscious. It has made me feel of little worth and has left me with a distasteful impression of the dating scene.\n\nFYI she was always a very needy, clingy Girlfriend.  I wasn't right for her, and to be honest I don't think anyone will be until she can become more confident and secure in her own life.  Filling a void in her person with a man won't be fun for anyone involved - to be honest I feel sorry for the next guy who gets caught up with her if she doesn't change.\nTL;DR:"}

They met rock climbing and when she was here, they would go on rock climbing day trips together. He's a pretty flaky guy so she's joked about how she feels like a crazy girlfriend trying to nail down plans with him. He's also mistakenly called her \"babe\" (what he calls me) when encouraging her, but I don't fault him for that because that's been on the tip of my tongue, too (kind of like when I called my second grade teacher \"mommy.\")\n\nI posted a picture of us from this weekend on Facebook and she commented: \"**Handsome.**\" It wasn't a coupley photo because those types of pictures make him uncomfortable, which I completely understand, and you'd have to look hard through Facebook to see that we're in a relationship.\n\nThe point of this is: Is it just me or **was that a weird comment?** Or should I be happy that he has supportive friends? I know from my perspective, all I'm getting is this filtered version of events - he just describes her as a super friendly girl who's good at rock climbing, and we all know that super friendly girls good at rock climbing are probably suffocated in men. It's just that I have plenty of guy friends and I don't think I'd ever say that on their photos, even when I'm wingmanning them. At least not in that straightforward way.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Picking up bad habits from the neighbor's dog.\nPOST: I live in an urban part of my city. The way our yard is, it sits one yard to the right of our neighbor's yard. The neighbor's yard is to the right of the back of the neighbor around the corner, but on a different street's property. Hopefully that makes sense. The neighbors on the other street own at least 7 pit bulls. I don't know the exact number because they are constantly breeding them and always keep at least one of the puppies from each litter. The dogs are outside year round, never brought into the house no matter the weather or time of day. They have very little human contact. I think the \"owners\" are scumbags, but since my city's Animal Control and dog warden officer did very little when my neighbor's pit bull attacked my dogs and yet they continued to let it off leash to roam in our yard, I doubt they'd do anything about these dogs. Since the dogs are kept outside, you can hear them bark. And they bark at every little noise and movement. My GSD has picked up the habit of barking when they bark. I don't have a problem with him barking when people come to the door or someone is in our yard because it's a very intimidating bark, and makes me feel safer especially when I'm home alone. But now, with him barking with the other dogs, I'm never sure if it's a false alarm or something to be aware of. I try to tell him no when he does it or tell him \"it's ok'\" which is the signal that I've checked things out and he can relax and not be on guard. He stops when I tell him this, but it doesn't seem to prevent him from not starting once the other dogs do.\nTL;DR:"}

Should this be a deal breaker?\nPOST: A little background we have been together for two years, engaged for nine months.  Money has been tight and we do share some of our income and expenses.  We've been planning our wedding but it has gone slow because of money being tight.  He didn't pay off the 8,000 credit card debt he's been working on.  He didn't pay off his car.\n\nHe was out on a boys night and won 175,000 at a casino on a poker hand on a slot machine.  He came home drunk and happy and took me out to dinner the next night to celebrate at my favorite restaurant.  I thought our wedding would finally be taken care of, and maybe our honeymoon too.\n\nNext thing I know the money is gone to pay for tuition for this single mother.  I asked him about her and he said he doesn't personally know her, and had no hand in picking her as beneficiary cause he set up an endowment and I don't know what that means.\n\nI don't know if this is a sign of things to come.  It's irresponsible to not even pay off your own debt before paying some girl's tuition.  I'm not sure what to expect from him anymore.\n\nI asked him what this was about and he doesn't say much other than we don't need the money that bad.  But we kind of do.  He was contacted by this girl and he didn't say much about what she said.  This all seems very odd behavior to me.  I asked him why and he won't say anything other than it's okay we'll be fine.

We laughed, went on dates, met each others families, sex, you name it.\n\n4 weeks ago she hit me with a bombshell and told me she was emotionally unavailable. She told me that her mother was saying that she began dating too quickly and she had been giving this some thought and wanted to let me know of her situation, and wanted to maintain friendship. Okay cool, she was upfront about everything, but i cant just be friends with someone I was emotionally invested in.\n\nSo, today she texted me asked me to meet up, and I want to talk to her about everything and why this happened, was her ex back in her life? Just shit like that... I am truly heart broken by this experience...\n\nNow my question, When a woman says they are emotionally unavailable what does that mean? Was she not interested in me, did I do something wrong?... I just felt in those 2 months all I wanted to do was make her and myself happy and form a relationship only to be blind sided with her saying she was emotionally unavailable to me right now.....\n\nI am not going to beg for her back, nor nag her when we meet. Just looking whether I should move on or not, and its almost been a month since we split... But we are meeting up in 4 days\nTL;DR:"}

It was definitely a seriously relationship. Not only that, it was really my first serious relationship. She was the first girl I fell in love with and had any strong reciprocated feelings for.\n\nIt's been a pretty rough time since then. I started feeling like I was rounding a corner but then found out that she got a job where she is going to stay in the same town as me (she's European and I had been expecting on her leaving the country soon, which I think would have helped). Anyway, the news of her getting a job she's excited about has made me sort of relapse and I'm feeling pretty awful again.\n\nI am just curious to see if anybody else has had a similar experience of getting into their first relationship this late, and having to deal with the heartbreak of it ending. I know breakups are never easy, but I feel like on top of the sadness I'm dealing with stuff I should have learned to deal with a decade ago. So any advice or shared stories, or whatever, would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I often don't have time to have a full meal, but recognize the need to eat, so I have a drawer full of Clif Bars in my desk, in my room. I don't make a huge amount of money, and while Clif Bars are not exactly expensive (like $1.25 each) it is annoying to buy 20 of them and only get to eat 12 of them. I am living with my parents right now while I'm saving money to get an apartment (bad credit means I need a pretty significant security deposit, plus I'm in SoCal), so it's my parents, my sister, and me. My older-brother and step-sister come over occasionally to hang out, as do various cousins and friends of the family. \n\nWhen I first noticed I was running out of bars way too fast, I asked my sister about it, and she denied it, so I assumed it must have been one of our guests and/or family members (my XBOX360 is in my room, so people are often in there to play it when I'm not home, which I don't mind.)\n\nIn order to find out who it was, to ask them to stop (or at least leave a buck when they take one or let me know) I set up my webcam on my laptop to take pictures every second that it detects a change (with a free software called Dorgem, which is awesome btw if you need it's functionality. It can even upload over FTP, but I disgress). \n\nThe problem lies in the fact that it DID catch the person stealing the Clif Bars, and it was my sister, who, home alone at the time, was walking around naked for reasons I don't really care to imagine. How do I confront her and tell her I know it's her stealing the bars without letting her know I saw her naked? I realize it was her fault but I probably could have handled this better by just letting everyone know I would be recording in my room when I went to work every day.\nTL;DR:"}

While he was out of town I went downtown with a few friends for some drinks. The guy that drove me down left way earlier than everyone else but I decided to stay, assuming I would get a ride from someone else. \n\nThe plan was for everyone to go back to the house where we started. That didn't end up happening. Everyone in the group ended up just going home from downtown. So my plan was to just get a cab.

(don't ask, i have no clue) he passive aggressively suggests that I go downstairs while i'm checking the dog out in this weird height chair.

I didn't think that it would be a big deal at all for her to pick me up. Did i cross a boundary or does he have a right to be mad at me?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Girl [16F] put chewing gum in my [21F] hair while going out\nPOST: Hello reddit, I have this problem and I need your opinion, advice and point of view. I know it's a petty problem but I still don't feel at ease. English is not my first language so please excuse me for any mistakes. So here is the story:\n\nYesterday, I went to the bar with my friend [19F] and my boyfriend [24M] (Minimum age in my country is 18 years, both drinking alcohol and going to clubs/bars.) This bar was really crowded, everyone who was dancing was rubbing against eachother. So ofcourse I did bump into people but it wasn't on purpose. No one did it on purpose. \n\nThere were these two guys on the dancefloor, one started to flirt with me so I ignored them both. This girl [16F] I don't know before this whole thing (Let's call her Ann) switched places with the two boys and started dancing against my back. So I took a step forward, so she wouldn't be touching me the whole time. I spotted three friends of mine [19M] and said hello to them. Suddenly I felt someone rubbing against my back and when I turned around, Ann walked away. I touched my hair and there's a wad of gum in my hair! I was shocked and pissed, while trying to get it out of my hair. These three friends told me to calm down and that she was underage, so I asked them how she got in the bar and apparently she knew the guards. Ann told one of the three boys she d\u00edd put the gum in my hair, but that I deserved it because I bumped against her the whole time. I don't get it because I went out of my way to NOT bump into her. I ignored her for the rest of the night.\n\nSo while I didn't cause a scene, I still feel like I had to do or say something. I know she's young but to put a piece of chewing gum in someone's hair!? That's very pathetic and nasty. I'm also very attached to my hair and it took me a really long time to grow them out. So if you guys have any advice for me, both for letting it go or what I should do, that would be great.\nTL;DR:"}

That set off a sequence of messages back and forth and she said that we should go cycling together when she was in the city again (she said she was hoping to visit the following weekend but that didn't happen in the end as she said she had to work). We continued chatting for the next while and I (coincidentally) had a work event coming up near where she lives so I suggested that we should meet up...she basically avoided that part of my message and talked about the other stuff I said so figured that was that and she wasn't interested at all. \n\nCue two weeks later she messaged me out of the blue saying she'd be in town that Saturday and that we should get lunch together - she even picked a time and a place. Then the Friday night before we were due to meet up she sends me a message cancelling...she didn't give a reason or anything, just a \"I'm sorry, I can't see you tomorrow :(\". I just responded with a 'too bad, let me know when you're up again and we'll go out then' kind of message and she didn't respond to that. That was about 3 weeks ago now and we haven't spoken since.\n\nSo, what I'm asking is (and I feel I probably know the answer already) does she have any interest or does she just like attention? She seems quite flakey to me. I should probably also mention that she is (quite literally) a swimsuit model so she has no lack of attention from guys.

Well my best friend has a 5 year old and a 2 year old so we have been doing play dates since before our girls could sit up on their own. The kids haven't seen each other in over a month because of the issues. Last night when her number called me I answered. It was the 2 year old in tears wanting to talk to my daughter because she misses her. I told her I would have my daughter call tomorrow because I was at work. After the phone call ended I sent a text to her mom asking when my daughter could call and she told me that her daughter and son used her phone while she was in the shower and to not worry about it. I told her that the kids miss each other and we shouldn't keep them apart because of our issues. I would be more than fine watching her kids or her watching mine so the 4 of them can play together. She blew me off. It hurts because these kids didn't do anything to deserve to not be friends. I know what it's like losing your best friend because parents can't get along. My daughter carries pictures of her friends around and asks when they can play together again. For the opportunity to finally be there and to get blown off bothers me as a parent and to hear the little girl crying because she misses her best friend just broke my heart. I wish things could be different but I have to support my family.\nTL;DR:"}

I have this awful pair of shoes I run in, just some dressy shoes I'd bought like 5 years ago, but since I wasnt taking running too seriously, I didn't want to invest in nice shoes. Eventually I was running every morning for just under 2 miles and suddenly I started getting pain in my shins, so that I could only run every 4 days, and decided it was time to get some nice running shoes.\n\nI went to a running shoe store, and the fabulous guy recommended shoes with more support for my feet based on how he saw I walked. He seemed very experienced and savvy and after trying out a few pairs I walked out with some new shoes. I was very excited to try them out but couldnt because it was raining. The day I happened be going up to my dad's cabin up north and I figured running the trails up there would be the perfect chance to test out my new shoes.\n\nMy dad's friend would also be up there with us, and since he had been running for quite a while I convinced him to go with me. We started off on the beautiful trails and it felt I was running on air compared to my old shoes. He had a nifty watch with GPS and was tracking how far we were going. Since I was feeling so great running, I let him decide how far to go. My shins felt hunky dory and the only pain I got was a bit in my ankle. By the time we got back I could barely keep up with him, and was completely exhausted. He told me that we ended up running 5K in 31mins.\nTL;DR:"}

At first she wanted to wait but after a while she came to the conclusion that it was okay and we slowly worked up to it. Starting with making out, then to oral, then to actual sex. I didn't force or push her to any of the steps, she just agreed it was okay with her. \n\nThis morning her mom found a condom in her car and is extremely upset with her. Her family is Christian but they rarely ever go to Church or do any religious activities except at family gatherings because the other family members are more religious. It makes my girlfriend feel terrible about herself because of how disappointed her mother seems to be in her. Her older sister was there as well and they both cried because a woman keeping her virginity in their culture is very important to them. They think that it has a big impact on her life and it affects other areas such as grades. She goes to a university that is about 2 hours away from the university where I attend so we don't have sex often and it doesn't take away from her studies. She makes very good grades and me dating her hasn't affected that.\n\nHer mom doesn't want me to know that she found the condom and told my girlfriend to not tell me about it. I feel really terrible about it though and want to help in anyway I can. I told my girlfriend that she should talk to her mom again about the situation to let her know that her respect is very important to her and it would be hard to live in the house if her opinion of my girlfriend was ruined. Her sister on the other hand doesn't live at the house anymore and since she is more stubborn would be harder to convince about anything. Her dad doesn't even know we are dating so he isn't involved in the picture. What do you think we can do? Is there anything we can do? Any advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

My company owns all buildings on the street to the south which dead ends into our large parking lot.\n\nAlways Amtrak police around since we are right next to some crossings and a train station. We also always have city cops around because their headquarters is on the street north of the tracks and because we are a transportation hub.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade I've worked here we actually had an Amtrak officer start pulling over and ticketing our customers for infractions that took place on the city road and had nothing to do with something they did at the crossing itself.\n\nA couple were for people that crossed to the left side of the street. This happens a couple times a day because we have road cones on the double yellow line leading into our lot and sometimes people get confused.\n\nA couple of them were for people running a stop sign that we actually had installed (and I am almost positive is on our property but I can't be sure 100%) to have customers stop at that point so they could be assisted by one of our employees.\n\nAt one point our GM and then the owner were both out there and when that didn't help they had the company lawyer who's firm is up the street come down. The lawyer was on the phone for quite a bit then was able to get the officer to leave after that.\n\nEverything I've heard is second hand with a little first hand and what I was able to gather from the security cameras so who knows what is actually correct.\nTL;DR:"}

Need advice.\nPOST: I'm planning on breaking up with my 30f girlfriend tonight and am a 34m. We've been together about 6months, maybe a bit longer.\n\nThe reason for breaking up is that I'm just not that into the relationship emotionally, and I feel as though I should be by now. I have a history of waiting until a relationship gets bad enough to end (which the girl typically does) so that I have a \"reason.\"\n\nThe reason I'm conflicted is because she is a great girl and has been good to me, but my past relationships (though they have ended, some better than others) were way more emotionally intense.\n\nWhen we first started dating, I noticed the lack of spark but thought it might be healthy for me to have a relationship that didn't jump out of the gates at lightning speed. Since then, the emotional connection hasn't really grown on my part but I believe it has on hers. I have also kissed someone else while dating her, which is something I never have and would never do in the past.\n\nI think I know the answer here, but am looking for outside perspective. Should I do it (thinking of doing it tonight) and what's the best way to go about it, if I should indeed do it? I know it seems ridiculous to be asking about this online at my age, but I've always been the dumpee after waiting out past bad relationships out of fear of hurting them. I don't want to make the same mistake again.\nTL;DR:"}

But I feel like it's not my place to ask him to change his look. It's not, like, fundamental to who he is... he's had other haircuts in the past. I think he just kind of feels comfortable with this now and he's in a rut. \n\nI also really don't want to hurt his feelings or make him think I don't like how he looks.

Anyhow, this kid comes in and starts listening to some really bad music, playing it really loudly. \n\nMy friend, who was working on a midterm project, asked the kid if he wouldn't mind turning it down as all the other 20 people in there would like to study as well. The kid literally stared at him for 5 seconds then sneered. Wow buddy.\n\nSo eventually after another 20 minutes of this, the prick gets up and leaves. However, he did not sign out of the computer or close his browser. More importantly, he did not log off the University in-system email. So my friend hops on this kid's computer. Since this prick was still logged in, he was able to select each course the kid was in, and send out mass emails to the whole class including the professor.\n\nAll the emails were inappropriate, but not raunchy or overly rude, but my favorite was, \"Hey guys, with midterm test coming up and it being curved, let's all just not show up. He will have to give us all an A!\" Since the email included the professor, I can only imagine what responses he received. \n\nLater that week we saw the kid walking down campus.

I worry he's so concerned with how he *should* be feeling, he's missing how he is feeling and what he's already got.\n\nFor me it's pretty much a question of emotional maturity I think, the more emotionally mature a person the more they know they have choices, considerations in relationships and it's not all disney magic and yes if you're happy with the person who loves you and you like them have chemistry and invest in your relationship it can be pretty awesome.\nTL;DR:"}

(First post so please tell me if i do anything horribly wrong.) I noticed a phenomena that I presumed is relevant only to new runners. This might be a completely usual thing and, if so, I apologize for taking up your time! I'd be interested to hear your opinion.\n\nI'm a new runner; I'd say I've been properly interested for about 3 months. I find that on my runs I'm gasping for air within the first couple of kilometers. However as I struggle on, maintaining my pace, I seem to need to breath less and less. Eventually by the 12km mark I'm breathing intermittently with my mouth shut.  Around the 15km mark I seem to hit a wall energy wise and start failing to maintain a pace as everything gets 'clunky' and forced. However even then my breathing is very easy.\n\nI'm asking you guys if this is a normal phenomena for new runners? Most reports I've come across suggest that most new runners are limited by their muscle soreness much more than a shortness of breath? If it is interesting why do think its occurring?\n\nAnyways some relevant facts that might help your ponderings: \n1) I'm a mid-20s male ~90kgs\n2) I'm NOT asthmatic \n2) Over 5km I'd struggle to maintain a 4:30/km pace\n3) For the 15ish km runs I run about 6:00/km pace\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I'm in no way concerned about this. I'm sure as my body adapts to my activity everything will normalize. Just thought it could be interesting to ponder about. :)\nTL;DR:"}

Anyways I was going through my Facebook and noticed Jill's single status. This guy and I commented on it and Jill said that they broke up because \"he's as cold-blooded as every other guy\". Now I was dumbfounded and told her that doesn't sound like Jack. Jill then goes to say how Jack's cold-blooded because he \"gave up\" on her because he couldn't make her happy, and that he didn't want to keep hurting her being so far apart. My buddy sacrificed his happiness and this girl calls him cold-blooded all over Facebook for the world to see.

Is there anything I can do?\nPOST: I really don't know who else to ask about this but, I've seen Reddit really help people out and give them sound advice that seems to work, so I ask you Reddit, what can I do? My long term favorite band (Ice Nine Kills,) got awarded a chance to open the All Star's Tour here in the States. The winner is being selected by popular vote between them and about 16 other bands. Early in the vote, Ice Nine Kills, pulled ahead of the only other band even close to them (an Australian band, called Capture the Crown), but the poll was promptly taken down with no explanation by the All Star's Tour. When the poll came back online a few hours later, Capture the Crown had around 100 more votes mysteriously appear in their favor. Since the polls launch, this cycle has continued numerous times, and many people voting in the poll (even people voting for other bands) are guessing it's rigged. Capture the Crown is the only unsigned band on the poll, and they only have two released songs. Today, the poll was re-introduced with promise of no more meddling in the results/status of the poll. Unfortunately, now anyone trying to vote in the poll is unable to, unless they're registering a vote for Capture the Crown. I'm not begging redditors to vote for my favorite band, I'm merely asking is there anyway I could possibly sway what seems to be happening?\nTL;DR:"}

She is, and always has been a solid girl, and carries her weight well. Never had an issue with it really. She has put on about 25 lbs since we've been together. She has a major health problem, and I've been to many of her dr appointments and he says she needs to lose about 50 lbs. \n\nI actually lost a lot of weight a few years ago, and have totally been on board with changing our lifestyle to be more active and eating healthy, but she constantly makes excuses about dieting and going out and doing physical things. \n\nI have to have a strict diet anyway due to health problems myself. I spend a good amount of money on good food and she always falls off the wagon. She needs her sweets. Something that bugs me is that she always hides/lies to me about what she eats.

(We're in advertising so I understand why he bought it, but I still think it's useless, as it's all 1990s.)

He kept asking me how I knew our dog didn't get to the wings I dropped and I promised him that he hadn't.  Finally he came into the living room and saw I'd dropped them in the box.  He started yelling about how I never tell him the truth when I'm afraid I'm going to get into trouble - and I guess it's true.  But in cases like this (and many others) I don't think I DESERVE to get in trouble.  The hot wings didn't touch any paper part of his books and I wiped off any areas that had sauce on them.

It has now been several months, another neighbor became a customer and over a period of about a week nearly burned down his property and then literally smashed it up with a 2x4. Luckily that guy is now gone. But the dealer now has some jerk coming over at all hours (afternoon, evening, 3am, 6am, etc) blaring bass that shakes my house. Dangerous people are passing through, and I hear strange noises outside in my yard, often. Now to top it all, he has at least one person living in a tent/compound they have erected in his yard, complete with shanty-town styled fencing around it and tarps and blankets to create privacy. All of these people who squat or pass through are clearly, ahem, customers of his. I believe one to be a prostitute, after she begged me to be some other girl on the phone to a man I now believe is her pimp. I have to do something about this situation, I have children, and I work and can't get any sleep with this ridiculous bass.

They flat out refused to help me before. I'm considering calling the OSBI Narcotics task force instead. What level of evidence will they require?

It's a very old house, creaks and all, and not to mention the door is loud as fuck and I also had two dogs at the time that'd bark at everything. \n\nApparently that day I must've been deaf, because I didn't hear shit. My stepdad (who was just my moms boyfriend of 2 years at the time) walked in, and found me there, using his girlfriends vibrator that he probably bought for her, just chillen. I'm an idiot and didn't even have a blanket or anything over me. So it was a full on view. \n\nAs if that isn't enough, I always took the batteries out of the remote to use it because I couldn't find any others in the house. Apparently I'd put them back in the wrong way, because he walked back in after the whole awkward scenario, asking if that's why the batteries in the remote were always messed up. Needless to say, 8th grade me was a fuckin idiot.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [19F] with my SO [20M] of 3yrs, wondering if situation qualifies as a \"lie by omission\"\nPOST: Hello r/relationships!\n\nI have a quick question about a pretty minor event; I just wanted an outside opinion. My boyfriend of 2 years was recently hanging out with his younger brother Mark (17 years old) and his girlfriend Paige. When I later saw my boyfriend that night, I asked him where Paige was planning to stay for the night (she was visiting from out of town and has very strict parents). He replied that he didn't know. I mentioned that maybe she was staying with one of the girls from their church and he didn't say anything and we changed the subject.\n\nLater I got an e-mail from Paige's mother verifying that she had, in fact, spent the night at my place during her visit (apparently this was the story Mark and Paige were telling). When I questioned my boyfriend, he told me that he had spoken with Mark the day he saw them about Paige possibly (not for sure) spending the night in his dorm room, and that if she did, would my boyfriend cover for them with her parents. My boyfriend agreed. \n\nI felt like this was a lie by omission, mostly because he knew I wouldn't agree with him lying for them, but he is adamant that he was 100% honest with me because he wasn't actually sure if she ended up staying in the dorm. \n\nThe issue is honestly no big deal and I'm not upset or anything, but I believe that by him leaving out this information (the conversation he had with Mark), that he is lying by omission. Am I crazy?\nTL;DR:"}

Interestingly enough, we met through Tinder (on one of the maybe 6 or so tinder dates I've ever been on).

I'm okay with him sending messages, but I'm afraid he's actively pursuing or meeting up with other people. \n\nI really don't want to let this turn into me being an unnecessarily jealous girlfriend.

I went on the site the day before the pre-sale began to check the seating chart and to my surprise, found that tickets were available for purchase. I had every intention to buy the tickets the following day, but went through with purchasing them.\n\nThe link I used was the official pre-sale link Above & Beyond sent me in an email. It directly linked to their Ticketmaster page where I was able to buy the tickets. I even received a confirmation email. At the time, I was naively under the impression that my link was approved for an even earlier purchase than the pre-sale since tickets appeared to be available. I did not know I was in the wrong at all.\n\nThen this morning I received an email from Ticketmaster saying that my tickets were canceled because they were bought before the pre-sale. Keep in mind that this was AFTER THE SHOW HAD ALREADY SOLD OUT and tickets are no longer available for that show.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get my original tickets back? It was clearly an error on Ticketmaster's end and now I can't even go to the show! I have contacted them through email and also submitted a report by calling them, but all signs tell me that they are not going to do anything about it. Please let me know if you have any ideas as to how I can get my tickets back.\nTL;DR:"}

Heres where i'm at. I'm wondering whether or not I should break up with my girlfriend, for the reason that she doesn't seem to enjoy getting sexual. \n\nShe allows me to have sex with her and she does other things for me, but at the same time she doesn't try to \"turn me on\" in a sense. It's hard to have sex with someone who just seems to do it because I only feel like doing it. \n\nShe never initiates anything sexual, nor does she enjoy the act of getting sexual. While were makin out or something like that, she just always seems like she is distracted about it. I literally will ask her if she enjoys it and she will literally not say a word, almost like she didn't hear what i even said. I sometimes have to ask her multiple times, before i get an answer that doesn't even tell me anything at all. \n\nI understand from her point of view that i'm the only other person she's slept with. While were having sex, she will just sit there and wait for me to tell her what to do. It's getting frustrating because its starting to make me feel less and less attracted to her. It makes me feel worse that I can't even get a straight answer from her.  \n\nThe hardest part of all this is just accepting the fact. I really like her personality but everything sexual seems to be lackluster, uninspiring and frankly kind of boring. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

About a year and a half into our relationship my gf started getting emotionally abusive. It was due to her father's abusive ways the stress of college, etc. I tried to talk to her about it and she would pretty much say she was working on it but then the next day she'd yell at me again over something as simple as stapler jamming. This went on for a few months... I couldn't go on with it so I broke up with her. 24hrs later I took her back because we were going to work on it. \n\nWe read a self help novel about abusive parents together and after that without even running it by me she confronted her dad about the abuse he denied it and kicked her out...now I'm not living with her....but now she's in financial trouble, in a crappy job, still trying to go to school she has no real family either. We've had a tough time dealing with all this stuff me helping to support her financially and emotionally. We had just started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. She got into a program that would lead to a better job she might be able to support herself I could feeeeel we were becoming a team. Then two nights ago she asked if I could look up the bus times for her new program to get back from there. I accidentally gave her the wrong time which placed her on the wrong bus and she didn't make it home. (She did like an hr later) It was an honest mistake but she went crazy it really reminded me of before. She would hangup on me, tell me my apologies didn't matter, then said I didn't support her emotionally....I do love her but this stuff hurts and it makes me feel like we are not on the same page. \n\nShe apologized to Me today saying she's just really stressed and what I did just opened the floodgates.... But its like you get really stressed and i have to deal with that?...Should I leave? What about her financial troubles and that she has no one to talk to?\nTL;DR:"}

Quickly, we hooked up and have been friends with benefits. We decided to continue with a vacation that had been planned months before, and will be leaving in 2 days.\n\nI'm a chronic depressive that has rather severe reactions to relationships and breakups. Just being friends with her is hard right now and even though logically I'm better off being friends than not (I don't have many friends and get along with her better than anyone else I know), I kind of feel like I'm being taken advantage of in a way. She's older than me and been through many breakups and as I've found out I'm far from the first man she's cheated on. She's acted more or less like we should forget it and move in with friendship, but I still love her in some way.\n\nI guess I'm still trying to decide if I'm making a huge mistake going on a vacation with her (and a few of her friends)?

After some very VERY close calls I managed not to kill myself and I'm now in my first year of college.\n\n  So my girlfriend(18) and I(18) have been going out for about 3 weeks now and I really like her and she really likes me. But the biggest problem I think with the relationship is well, me. I've never had a serious girlfriend before, because all the other ones broke up with me within 3 weeks(note: this is because they were terrible people and basically stringed me along), so HEY I broke a record with holding on to a girlfriend for more than 3 weeks! WOO! Anyway so yeah I can't even have a good love life go figure!\n\n Anyways every time I see her talking to another guy or doesn't respond to my texts, calls etc. I think she's going to break my heart and basically make me look like a huge fucking idiot like all the other ones, I'm sorry I'm complaining a lot. But that's just my problem I keep expecting her to basically send me on another spiraling depression where I physically have to stop me from killing myself. \n\n  My family is a group of great people now (I don't know they just kinda decided to stop yelling and hitting each other and me) but I for one can not figure out a way to fucking move on so...help?Also no I can't get therapy because my family is having trouble paying for college and I can't really afford a therapist.\nTL;DR:"}

Why don't we sentence people who do good things to mandatory all expense paid vacation time?\nPOST: Quite frankly, we in the U.S. spend a fortune on inmates in the prison system. As a preventative measure, and an incentive to commit acts of benevolence, why can't there be a system setup, similar to a process of judicial review, where people good people are rewarded and we can use public funding toward reinforcing productive acts within society, instead of growing funding for a system that contributes and promotes degradation of supposedly \"corrupt\" people.\n\nJust think about it. One example that I can think of is that someone currently in an impoverished setting, with a hopeless mindset, would usually consider committing a criminal act such as larceny, as a way to escape their financial or social situation by acquiring status or monetary gains unlawfully. With a system setup to properly access and reward positive behavior, these people would set out to be productive and change their surroundings for the better, with the intent of being rewarded.\nTL;DR:"}

My pregnant mom was carrying a bag that she had to hold underneath due to the weight of the contents as well as a cup of soda from lunch. I was holding my own cup of soda from lunch but no bags. When we were about to get on the escalator I offered to take her drink so she would have a free hand for the escalator, and this is where I messed up. I have never been on an escalator without at least one hand on a side rail but now I had both hands full with drink cups. My mom decided to go down a few steps in front of me and I follow her. I hesitate too much to get on the escalator that is moving down seemingly faster than I ever remember. I get one foot on but can't find my footing and almost loose balance before I can get my second foot on the escalator safely. I almost fall over but just in time catch myself to keep from killing/injuring my mom, my unborn brother, and myself. However I only get a split second of relief because while getting my foot safely on a step I spill the soda's (luckily they were both clear lemon-lime sodas) mostly on the escalator but also a little bit on myself and a lot on my mom. We both have to clean up at the restroom at the bottom of the escalator so we don't get the car sticky on the way home.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/GetMotivated\nTITLE: Never give up the hunt!\nPOST: Finally breaking my lurking status to post in this sub. (even if it scares me, because the internet is a scary place sometimes.)\n\nI went to college right after losing my mother, not giving myself proper time to grieve. I took an internship and kept going to school full time. I graduated about three years ago, and I couldn't find a job. It felt hopeless, and I was finally starting to feel the pain of losing my mom full force because the only other thing distracting me was the depression of not finding work. I had to get a job somewhere, so I started a lot of horrible jobs like door to door sales, Target, and a shady mall kiosk where the boss forced me work while I was violently ill. I at least had some freelance work to keep me going, but sometimes I wouldn't get paid, and or screwed out of getting paid. I was so miserable. Thankfully after a year and a half I found somewhere else. It wasn't the bad work, but it just wasn't for me and the pay was nothing livable. I kept up with my side work, trying to get better. After years of applying to what felt like a billion jobs, I finally had an interview somewhere I really wanted to work. I'd had other jobs I got my hopes up on just to be let down. I thought they were just okay with my work and found someone better after the interview, in my mind they were dodging my phone calls, when in fact they were just busy. I really wanted to give up on everything, the job, my career, ect. I told a friend about the interview and how they said they would call and he told me to call them again right now. When I finally got a hold of one of the people in a confusing conversation they were asking me when I was starting. Turns out I got the job. I started last week at a dream job. It may not be the dream job, but it is absolutely a start. I have good hours, and something I can live off of. I learned that day to never give up, everything just takes time. :) Thank you guys for helping me stay motivated! Don't ever give up!\nTL;DR:"}

It was in a test tube with my compound and to encourage a precipitate, I was scratching the edges. Anyway, this reaction simply wasn't preciptating and I scratched that little bit too hard and before I knew it the glass smashed and the acid was all over my jeans. (my lab coat was open, bad GLP I know, but it was a long day) \nIn a moment of panic I knew I had to washed as I slowly started seeing my black jeans become scattered in many little holes. Then I recalled I had trousers in the car, if I made it fast enough I could get to the car, run back to the showers, and switch pants, with nobody knowing what a silly mistake I'd made (I was a new guy and I didn't want to seem like an idiot). So I begin this journey, I'm waddling to avoid any contact of acid jeans with skin, but then it does reach my skin and I feel it. A light burning sensation on my man parts begins. I know I had to take the trousers off, i'd made it to the car, inside I flung off my pants and trousers only to realise that my trousers weren't there. I'd taken them out at the gym. Fortunately i made a lab coat/ skirt, which didn't cover my buttocks at all well, ran to the shower, got clean and called my housemate to bring trousers and a towel to work as I sat cold and wet in the emergency shower for half an hour. \n\nAt this point, I thought it'd gone okay, nobody had noticed this whole vasade, until I go to the office, which erupts with a large jeer. \n\"Hey Targe13, try to keep your pants on\" - Boss. The lab coat skirt waddling is now a widely enjoyed office image.\nTL;DR:"}

I was speaking to one of them, let's call her H, while the other one who we'll call B was busy eating and watching something on her phone. Now while i was talking with H I could see B in my peripherals, so out of the corner of my eye I saw her raise her hand up to what I *thought* was going to be either A. a high five or B. she was going to punch me, which was something we often did to each other. So, without even pausing in my conversation with H, I went for the high five option and shot my hand out and connected with what I had hoped was her hand.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nI ended up smashing the palm of my hand into the side of her drink she had raised to her mouth to drink. She slowly looked at me with disbelief before getting up to go to the bathroom. I wish I could say I got up and helped her clean up but I couldn't move due to the fact that I was laughing too hard.\nTL;DR:"}

Only very recently have we noticed that getting intimate has been somewhat more difficult, as I haven't been as easily satisfied, I suppose. I haven't been getting fully aroused nearly as easily as I used to be, especially when it comes to foreplay and such, and this is only a very recent occurrence. It's also a lot harder for me to orgasm during this time which we've found perplexing, as it used to be very easy.\n\nOur relationship is in no danger as we don't see sex as a huge factor in it at this point in time, and we also love each other very much. More than anything we're just confused as to why it's happened so suddenly. We figure my body's just gotten used to it and needs \"more\", but we honestly don't really know where to go, what to do, or if we're ready to go further than we already have. We also have concerns with the idea of sex now that we've run into this problem, because no matter how much we may want to do that in any time soon, if I'm not aroused it'll be too painful to commit.\n\nI really hate asking this because I'm already really embarrassed, but is there any advice anyone can give me? I'd be super appreciative of it. Thanks a bunch.\nTL;DR:"}

Am I crazy even thinking about it?\nPOST: Short backstory: I was in a relationship with my girlfriend [22] for over 3 years, we had an amazing relationship and we lived together for one year. I trusted her 100 %, we were best friends, yadayada, the entire deal. In short, I have never been so close to anyone before and neither had she. This summer, both of us were starting exhcange programs in far-apart countries and decided to break up, even though we loved each other. The reason being none of us had been single since we were 17 (when we met, we both had been in previous relationships shortly before). We have decided to meet up again when we get back after one year and see what happens. Mind you, the break-up was very sad for both of us and we spent all the time up to my departure together.\n\nNow, 4 months since we broke up, I miss her terribly. I did not think it would be this hard at all. I have told her I miss her, but not in too much detail. I do not know how she feel about me right now. We have not talked about visiting each other at all, but I want to. I am pondering to go surprise-visit her soon. The flight is upwards of 17 hours, this is close to the other side of the fucking globe. Is this totally insane? Does it put way too much pressure on her? Does she even want to see me? Does anyone here have a remotely similar experience?\nTL;DR:"}

He is great. I have no other issues aside from this one. Now, I know it is normal to occasionally fantasize while having sex, everyone does ( id like to think ). The issue is that he ALWAYS has to and cant finish without it. The other issue being I didn't know this until now and feel betrayed in a way. It makes me feel awful to know that every time we have had sex the thought of someone else was in his head. \n\nThese are woman he knows, not ones he has slept with he says but still woman he knows. Which makes me feel like I am just not enough for him. He says that's not true and that he is incredibly attracted to me , which i never doubted before and that its just how his mind is trained sexually at this point. He tells me all the time how beautiful and sexy he thinks I am, but if that is the case, why can he not finish with just the thought of us,ever? \n\nOur sex life isn't boring or plain, it is fun, adventurous and frequent and he says its the best sex he has had.

I'm not the most smartest kid, I get middling grades, but I usually do allright. My university has a policy that to continue in my Engineering program, I need to have a 60 average over the year. Coming from highschool where I didn't really try or study at all, I ended up royally fucking up during my first year of University and only got a 55 average. The school ended up giving me a break, and let me retake any courses I didn't get a 60 in(most of them) and ended up getting above a 60 average. That was 3 years ago. \n\nFast forward to today. I've been done school for the past month and a half, but haven't checked my grades since I've been scared shitless I've failed all of them. So today I told myself everything would be fine, and checked my grades. I passed all of my courses. Now a pass is anything above a 50. Everything looked good, I was happy. Then I saw the little fine print under the grades. \"Must drop out of the Faculty of Engineering.\" I was frozen for a good 2 min, not really grasping what I had just read. Then it hit me. I didn't get a 60 average. I had too many 58's and 59's. My average ended up being 59.2, and since I had already been given a break in my first year, I am fucked. I don't know how to tell my parents that I've basically ruined the last 4 years of my life. That I've wasted thousands of dollars for nothing. \n\nNow I know I could have prevented this. I could have studied harder. But I tried my best. And now I have to live with the consequences. I know all this, but it's still hard. It doesn't help that I've had a minor case of depression since highschool, so this really hurts. I don't know what to do. I'm just straight fucked.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 19 years old, fat, not very social-able, and I don't think I had a real friend ever in my life. A friend, who you can talk to about your problems, hang out with, and play video games or whatever with anytime. Never in my life did I have a single person that I was able to do those things with. Elementary school, I got made fun of a ton for being fat. Middle school, I just became the quiet lonely Asian kid that nobody ever talked to. High school, the same, but I somewhat came out of my shell, joined the wrestling team, made a few \"friends\", but after graduation, we never really spoke anymore.\n\nIt's now two years later and not only do I still have no friends, I procrastinated for three years on losing weight( I lost 50 lbs wrestling then gained it back). \n\nNot only is that bothering me, but fuck man. For the past two years, I've been attending a community college and have been studying my butt off. All four semesters, my lowest GPA was a 3.67 and accumulated 60 transferable units. I had a goal to go to a four year university of my choice and I got accepted. I wanted to experience living on my own and perhaps could try my luck making friends in a city 6 hours away. June 1st was the last day to submit my intent to register and I didn't do it. I got too scared. What if I move 6 hours away, only to be lonely in a city that I know nobody in? Now I'm going to some university in my city, which isn't bad, it's just not satisfying to me.\n\nSo...\nTL;DR:"}

Well, a few days ago, his car died, and he has no way of driving down here. The next plan was for me to drive up Christmas day after I've spent my time with my family, and just to spend a couple of days with him and his family then. Well, just tonight, my car has decided to not work properly. Of course this would happen to be two days before Christmas, when no place will be open to fix it. There's no way I'll be able to drive two hours away with my car the way it is. Chances seem pretty slim that my parents will let me borrow one of their cars, and my boyfriend isn't sure he'll be able to borrow a car on his end, either. \n\nSo basically, I'm looking for ways to keep my mind off of it and cheer myself back up so that I can still enjoy Christmas this year.

A lot of fights, passive agressive anger, ruined holidays and so on.\n\nLately I've seen things I wasn't meant to see. \n\nHe praised one of his ex girlfriends here on reddit, how gorgeous she looks and how fantastic she was in bed. Claimed he had the best month of his life with her. He posted this from an account that he knows that I know of, but when I told him I had seen it, he called me a stalker and got defensive. Later he said it had been a mistake posting it, and that I \"have to understand he was exaggerating.\"\n\nWouldn't been *such* a big deal, if it wasn't for how he refers to me; boring, selfish, that I turn him off. He doesn't touch me when I visit him. \n\nI also saw him talking to his friends on facebook after a night they had going out (openly on their facebook wall, turning up in my news feed), where his friend asked him \"How did it go with that girl?\" and my BF replied that if 10 was his two top sexual fantasies, she was an 8. After seeing this, I asked what had happened. He said nothing happened. Then he hid all his facebook content from me (and said it was not from me, but from everyone).\n\nI don't understand why he is still with me.\nSometimes I feel like he is just with me because someone else left him, but then agin, what good does it do him having me as a substitute that he doesn't even find attractive? I would understand if he was with me because he got *something* out of it, but I literally offer him nothing.\n\nI know there's no answers for me. \n\nThat's why we barely talk anymore.\n\nI want things to be ok.

We go out one night and land at a mexican restaurant which i indulge on, however unbeknownst to me this is where the fuck up happened. Being 16 and completely reliant on parents for money I had being mulling over a pair of jeans to purchase at Express inside the hotel mall, and had come to the decision that whence we returned to Caesar's it would be the perfect time to purchase it, instead of returning to our hotel room with the rest of the family where i could have saved myself a copious amount of shame and embarrassment. So I individually trek it through the masses of people until i arrive at the store where I picked up the single pair of jeans and proceeded to the changing room to try it one final time. The perky shop assistant's face dropped, and I remember reading this in an earlier post, 'you never realise why people are looking at you a certain way until you see what they're seeing'. I get ushered into the changing room and face the mirror to see what looks like, a giant jizz stain coming down the front of my black sweats.

We lived together, travelled around for awhile and after a year returned to our home in the US. \n\nI felt conflicted about returning and we talked about staying another year, but ultimately we decided to return.  He was eager to get a career started (one he cannot do in a foreign country). Initially, I was satisfied coming home, seeing old friends and family.  It's been about 6 months, and for the last 5 months I have been thinking nonstop about how to continue seeing the world, traveling, etc.  \n\nI spend a lot of time planning how to move back, saving money to have an extended RTW trip, etc.  I have talked to my SO, and even tho he wants to do the same in an ideal world, doesn't really want to be gone for so long and doesn't really feel like he can because of his work, student loans, etc. \n\nI have talked to him about saving and doing a RTW trip together in a few years, when his loans are not as large and trying to problem solve.  We've discussed marriage a lot lately, too.  He says he cannot commit to doing a trip like that with me and doesn't know if he really wants to.  I feel like I'm young and it's something I have to do.  \n\nI am at the point of going without him within the next year, which we've discussed.  He feels like me traveling and being away will put our relationship in jeopardy and he can't guarantee he can do long distance with me for so long.  I will also miss him a lot and feel lonely along the way, I think.\n\nI love him and want to be with him, but I also want to travel and see the world while I am still young.  I also don't want to throw away such a great relationship that I can really see being a successful lifelong partnership.  Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What are some pathetic things you have seen people do?\nPOST: Last night I was at a Barnes & Noble quietly reading a book and drinking a frappuccino. Everything was quiet until I heard a camera shutter sound, specifically that of an iPhone. I looked up and saw some lady with a book open, looking around to make sure no one was watching her. I, of course, kept looking without her noticing and saw her take at least five more pictures of pages in a book (This book looked short and more like an instructional book rather than a novel, so taking pictures of it would probably be good enough for her). The only thing that stopped her was an employee who came through the aisle towards her, which caused her to suddenly lose interest in taking pictures of the book. The worst part about it was either that she had an iPhone and looked like she had a decent amount of money, yet couldn't be bothered to buy the book, or the fact that the shutter sound was so loud and she didn't bother to, or maybe even know how to, turn it off.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Dog is literally scared of everything!\nPOST: I just found this subreddit/am new to reddit!  Hoping for some kind advice for my two year old soft coated wheaten terrier who has developed a fear of, well, *everything*.  Namely:\n\n* noise (talking traffic, bags blowing, stomping/scuffing feet while walking, things falling).  Strangely, everything but thunder!\n* going for walks (which I assume has to do with the noise).  It's like she experiences a sensory overload and goes into full-fledged panic attack/avoidance.  Sometimes she will even refuse to go out into our backyard for a pee.\n* people talking in loud voices (if my boyfriend and I are even having a loud discussion she will either sit and shake, or hide under my bed).\n* children.\n\nThere is an entire list of other issues but these seem to be the ones that concern me the most, considering they affect her everyday life.  She started out alright, but as she gets older, she is getting worse (save for being outside, as we have moved to the quieter suburbs but she gets spooked often).  \n\nWe have had her since she was a puppy; unfortunately she did come from a pet store/puppy mill so i'm not sure whether that has anything to do with her nature or not.  We did the bulk of her training while we were living in an apartment in the city so she has had *plenty* of exposure to noise and hectic surroundings.  It's not like she's in an abusive household, so the fear of loud voices is strange to me.  She's always been around children but has always shied away from them.  Her preferred method of dealing with her panic is to flee; I truly don't believe she would ever become fear aggressive.  \n\nIdeas?  We have tried high-reward treats but she is not food motivated at all.  We have tried reassurance, and have been told to knock it off because it will confuse her.  We have tried to limit exposure, and over-expose her...neither works.  I just worry that the more things we try, the more confused she gets.\nTL;DR:"}

Those are usually for a couple hours a couple times per week. When I do hangout, it seems subconscious, but I start vegatating and it shows. It is damn near impossible to fake interest in the conversations because my face apparently gives it away.

I hang out with her fine, and I don't have any problems with my roommates. I value time higher than money, so when I feel like I am wasting my time on asinine conversation it starts to get miserable after 15-30 minutes. Of course they love talking about that crap. I've already explained hundreds of times that either its too late, I have prior obligations, or I just find it uninteresting in just as many ways.

What I have found, in most cases, is that in relationships people get bored of each other once they get too comfortable, end up bored, and then break up.

I crave being loved and needed, and loving others; but I've never had it in my life, from family or otherwise.  \n\nI have a stable career, make enough money to support a family, and am in the greatest shape of my life. I *know* I have positives going on for me, but how can I use that to attract friends and love into my life?

I ask them how is that possible when I just talked to a representative that said I was all set. Once again, never answered my question, just apologized.

I've never done any business through Citibank, never had my account information transferred to them. And I certainly never okayed that it be taken care of online through them. So naturally I tell him this. He apologizes and said he couldn't \"opt me out\" of dealing with my loan payments through them. So I ask to speak to a manager. The guy puts me on hold for about five minutes then comes back and tells me that he was able to opt me out of this Citibank (even though he had just said he couldn't) and says that my payments will be sent to my physical address from now on. \n    I am SO skeptical that I will actually receive my bills.

By the time I started my training, I had got so emotionally and physically stressed that after two weeks of training, my stomach gave up and I started throwing  up blood and gall.

I've only had two serious relationships in my life lasting around 6 months each in conjunction with my many informal relationships. \n\nThe two serious relationships, was first ended due to inexperience, na\u00efvety etc. from being young. The second was essentially a perfect relationship where I broke up with the guy because he was being 'too nice' to me (this itself is a serious issue I still have with myself and don't quite understand why).\n\nAfter the second relationship, that's when I began to sleep around more and maintain informal relationships. My lifestyle so far isn't exactly optimal for a serious relationship leading to the many informal relationships formed. What has happened so far is that many of the subsequent guys I've had relationships with did reciprocate feelings albeit not enough to attempt long distance. This is understandable though it has then led me to solely sleep around more and attempt to forego getting too emotionally invested.   \n\nWhat the result of the above is that since my second serious relationship (which is my fault for ending), I've since been second guessing my personal worth. Even though my situation now is not very accommodating for a serious relationship - I've been trying to figure out if there's something inherently wrong with myself.

I would like to import a vehicle into the US legally. The car I'm looking for however its not yet 25 years old (and no it is not a skyline.) If I wait it out the chance of finding one in decent condition will continue to fall or it may no longer be an option with my budget.

Similar experiences and/or advice out there?\nPOST: Hey Redditors :) I work at an online retail company. We were having some small inventory mix-ups (these have been going on for months and stem from system issues that started before I was hired). The other day my boss called me into his office after lunch - I had just gone for a walk on a hot day. He said \"We're way off on inventory. I've been meaning to talk to you about this for awhile now: I need you to stop getting high during lunch.\" He claimed my eyes were red, and he said he's \"known\" for awhile. I take a walk almost every day and wear no sunglasses, so yes, my eyes get a little pink. I also have not smoked a bit of pot in the past 4 years. \n\nDuring this conversation, my boss also mentioned that he didn't care if I was getting high - \"some people can get high and function just fine\" he said. This seemed like a warning flag to me as I'm not really into working in a place where the boss thinks coming to work high is OK. It also seemed like a convenient way for him to blame inventory errors on me, when there is no way one single person is causing them.\n\nStraightaway after work I went and got a drug test to prove I'm clean. I'm considering leaving the company because I feel very targeted and uncomfortable. Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How do i get over my ex [19M] cheating on me [19F] with my (then) close friend [19F]?\nPOST: Last year, my then boyfriend broke up with me after a 4year relationship. Shortly after, a few months or so, i discovered he was with my close friend (of ~6 years). The timing of everything was ambiguous to me but I assumed that he'd just moved on really quickly. I was upset and i blamed both parties equally for hurting me because I felt that they had an obligation to at least talk to me. Not to ask permission or my blessing but just to breathe some word of it to me. Instead, a mutual friend accidentally blurted it out and that was how i found out about it all. From there, it just circulated and between all of us, myself, my ex and my friend, it was sort of unspoken knowledge that they were now together and that i knew. \n\nWe haven't talked since then (early this year) and I've been doing okay. I got over being sad/mad about everything but today i found out there was more to the story than i had originally thought.\n\nThey used to hang out one on one, a weekly occurrence that I was not aware of. On one occasion he kissed her and because we had exams coming up he decided he'd break up with me after that. Fair enough. After the break up I asked him if he had feelings for anyone and he straight up denied it. So he lied as well. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here. I understand what has happened but I'm lost as to what I should do. A part of me wants to make them know how badly theyve hurt me but a part of me feels like it's too far back to revisit it. Do I need closure, should i talk to them? Is there any point in facing what has already happened ages ago. I just feel really betrayed and disappointed in both of them and I'm not sure what I should do. Or how to really get over all this. Any advice would be very much appreciated\nTL;DR:"}

I'm trying to source everything, but sizing's become an issue for one of my groomsmen.\n\nWe love him to death and he's a great guy, though a little depressed atm, but he's... large. Very large. I'm worried about finding him a vest that'll fit while match everyone else's.\n\nAnd then, he's reluctant to tell me his current sizing (which I know he knows, because he's also in the wedding party for a mutual friend of ours). He says he wants to \"lose weight\" before the wedding--which is all well and good, but we won't be getting stuff tailored until 2 months or so before the wedding, including me. I don't want to wait until the last minute to order stuff. (It's almost April, and the wedding's in October. That gives me 6 months.)\n\nSo! I suppose my question is two fold. One, when do I get the groomsmen to order their clothes in time for the wedding? And two, how do I gracefully/tactfully/successfully clothe my bigger, potentially too-optimistic groomsmen?

However, the situation I'm in is a bit different.\n\nShort version: After typing seven or eight paragraphs I figured I needed to be more succinct, so here it is.\n\nAt 2:09am on July 27, 2014 a lady knocks on my door asking for a ride in to town. I make up an excuse as I am uncomfortable with the idea (she looks stoned in my non-expert opinion).  After I close the door, she steals a power tool off of my front porch.\n\nI call the police, give them a DVD of my security camera footage showing the exchange, the theft, and a pretty good image of her face.  Two Facebook friends confirm her identity so I give them her name, and the police immediately recognize her by the video.\n\nThey pick her up a few weeks later and charge her.  She returns the scroll saw and says I \"gave her permission to use it.\"  Yeah, a perfect stranger asks to borrow a tool at 2am.  \n\nShe's going to trial (she turned down a generous deal) since she was in trouble previously for some unrelated stuff and I assume is on probation).  \n\nSo my dumb question is this:  If the police ask me to come in and explain my side, do I?  I am in no way the target of any investigation--I am the victim and I feel like at least some input will likely be needed from my end for things to proceed.  But in the back of my head I keep hearing everyone on this sub saying, \"DON'T TALK TO COPS, PERIOD.\"\nTL;DR:"}

He leads with a sexual undertone, and this makes me hesitant and skeptical.\n\nToday I told him that I wish we could fall asleep next to each other, and he said he was bummed and confused. He's confused because I told him yesterday that I don't feel comfortable with that, and now I'm telling him that I want that. I said I'm just as confused.

I even began seeing someone. I probably didn't talk to her in a month. One day she literally grabbed me and took me to a more private place so she could tell me she really wanted to be with me and that this time apart had allowed her to realize how wrong she was and how much she had hurt me. I decided to give her a chance. \n\nProblems arose when she found out I had gone out with another girl and gone to places she considered 'ours'. She demanded that I completely stop talking to her, delete her from fb and things like that. \n\nSix months later I moved to another city about 250 miles away. I work during the day so I don't really talk to her a lot during the day. In the afternoon we used to skype and talk. I started to get into gaming and she complained that I would not stop playing to talk to her (you can't pause online games). \n\nEventually our conversations turned into fights because she felt I did not do anything for her.

I am not someone who can maintain long conversations, I'm very pragmatic. I'll say what I need to say without taking detours.

A couple of months ago I met a girl and since then we've hooked up approx 10 times. In between those 'dates' there was actually no communication between us. Now, this month things began to speed up, I saw her a couple of times and we were chatting multiple times a week on fb. Two weeks ago she even texted me out of the blue late at night if I could come over (I did). Six days later we went to the cinema/diner but that night I couldnt stay over because she was tired and feeling sick (it was really late). I found this a bit weird because sleeping can be just sleeping... It wouldn't disturb her. We made some vague arrangements to go to the cinema the next week. I texted her when I would be able to go, the next day. I waited 2 days for a reply.. nothing, I sent her another text to which she replied she couldn't go.  \nAlso, it seems to me that since that last date, she has blocked me on facebookchat. She had some specific moments when she was online, I haven't seen her online since our last date (while she's obviously using it). Hell, I even see her 'likes' passing by in the stream and she appears offline, so it's pretty obvious.   \nI'm guessing I did something wrong/made a bad impression during last date, and now she's locking me out? Is there any 'positive' reason why she would block me on facebook chat? Does she need some time off? I don't get it.. And no, I'm not an obsessive 'chat-starter', she initiated probably more conversations than me. The main reason why I'm so confused is that in our communication she is (was) acting totally normal (on the last date, in her text...).

They told me that the claims just happened the past day and today so they're still in processing and not through the system yet. Until they do, BoA can't file a claim. In other words, there's nothing I can do at this point. \n\nSaturday (today) - \n\nWoke up, checked account, saw about $90 worth went through and now is out of processing. Called BoA to file a claim and did, but was told that I have to wait until Monday to call again to file another claim if the other transactions go through.

I was at a friend's house with a few people, and we got bored and decided to call some people up. We weren't paying attention to the time, so we were calling people around midnight. \n\nI have a good \"generic, female voice actor\" voice, so I would introduce myself as a representative of the local Baptist church that two of the friends I was with attended. It went well for a few calls, with me mostly asking them personal questions that would be totally inappropriate of a church to ask (i.e. How many bottles of wine do you drink per week, when was the last time you changed your child's clothing, how old were you when you were born, pretty lame stuff but we were already having a good time). About the fourth call in, before I can even talk I hear music blaring and a baby crying. I start in on my introduction, but the lady cuts me off and starts screaming. Here's a rough recollection: \n\n>How fucking dare you call at this hour? You woke up my damn baby. You know, some people have to work in the morning, and I got this damn baby keeping me up! And my other fucking kid's gonna be tired, too, and he's gotta look after my baby! Who do you fuckin' think you are? You ain't doin' the lord's work! You're a god damn Satan loving hussy, you fucker! Go fuck yourself! \n\nEveryone else thought it was hilarious, but I was pretty disturbed by it. The lady did not sound like she should have kids.\nTL;DR:"}

He has no idea what he's gonna do for a job and I feel like me being with him is obviously affecting his decision.

I'm scared to death to do it because I can't bear the thought of not being with him.

The landlords live next door. \n\nFor a short while I tried to help bob quit meth. We deleted the phone numbers of his meth dealers, smashed a crack pipe together and dumped a whole boot load of needles at the local disposal place in the middle of the night. It didn't work, he picked up new equipment and relapsed. He buys street meth and refines it using DIY lab equipment. From what I recall, this process involves dissolving the meth in isopropalalcohol, washing it in acetone and then letting the acetone evaporate leaving a more pure version of meth. I'm a little uncomfortable with having a micro meth refinery in the house I live in but my options seem limited.\n\nI dont have the money to move at the moment. I am super poor and somehow managed to find a place that costs $70 a week even though I am 5 mins on the train from the city. I cant afford the capital cost of moving but I also cant afford a 50% increase in rent that I would likely have to pay for a similar place.\n\nI also dont see a way to get him to move out aside from snitching on him to the landlords/police which I'm unwilling to do. He also loves this place.\n\nI think his dedication to giving up meth is a bit too variable for long term success to be plausible at this time. Perhaps with long term support he can break free of addiction but my dedication to helping him also waivers. I have a university degree to focus on not failing. I dont want to abandon him in what seems like his hour of need but at the same time I want my home to be a sanctuary away from other peoples problems. I also fear that the landlords will eventually discover he is addicted to meth and that will cause me great troubles of my own since we are both on the lease.\nTL;DR:"}

I really do love the look of UW and I really am not that big of a fan of the New York state schools. The only issue is UW out of state is obviously pretty pricey. My parents have agreed to pay the State University of New York price (20k) to any school I want to go. That would roughly leave out of state at 32k.

I don't flirt with him or lead him on in any way. In fact, we only really chat in passing.\n\nOver the past week or so, I've noticed that this co-worker has been getting more touchy-feely. He comes up behind me and rubs my shoulders, or he'll touch my arm when he walks by. He started calling me 'sweetheart' and 'babe'. It was annoying but he seemed to do it to everyone so I figured it was just a quirk of his. \n\nLast night, I was by myself in the office doing some paperwork. My co-worker came up behind me and suddenly kissed me on the cheek. I asked \"What was that for?\" and he just walked away. At first it didn't bother me, but as the night went on I started to feel a little violated, and I noticed that I got really nervous when I was alone near my co-worker.

Am I wrong?\nPOST: So, my boyfriend has an ex that he had been dating for three years. She was living with him, and she was a total bitch, using him for his money to save up and move out on her own. She stole things from him, and she never really gave him a real explanation.    \n\nBut that was over a year ago. Since then, we started dating, and things have been going well. But what has been bothering me is that he can't listen to certain songs or go certain places, etc. because of his ex girlfriend.   \n\nWe got into an argument this morning about it, and he started throwing the fact that I can't give him blowjobs in the car, because I was assaulted that way prior to meeting him. He said that it's hypocritical that I can't get over my past but expect him to.    \n\nIt's not the same thing. I love him to death, but I am so hurt by this. I don't know if I'm wrong to ask him to stop living in the past if I can't. I feel like crying. I don't wanna lose him, but like I said, I'm so hurt by this.    \n\nAt the same time, his dad just died a week ago, so he could just be lashing out. But that doesn't give him the right to be an asshole. He read my messages with my friend of me saying exactly that and got mad at me for that, too. Could anyone help?

It's weird to me how you see people everyday that are in love, and yet here I am not even knowing how it feels to be loved. I love love, I want it, but getting it is hard and it sucks. If I want somebody in my life, a girl, I feel like I can never get her, I can't start conversations with girls, I don't know when it's alright, I don't know how to hold that conversation, and hell I don't have a single friend that's a girl that I could love. I honestly feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life alone and it's saddening, I wish that there was anything I could do to change this. Here I am, 18 years old, next year, grade 13 of high school.. I feel like although I have people that I've known for many, many years, friends, I feel like none of them can help me. When I think about what I have, I realize that I don't truly have it. I don't know how to fix my problem with finding girls, finding people I can talk to, and hell, even finding a girl I can love and have an actual conversation with. I can't speak with my parents about anything, they're unsupportive and they may even be the people that are holding me back most. Life feels pretty alright the less I think about it, but when I actually think about it I know how much it really sucks to me. I wish things could change but I don't know how to change them.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [20M] am feeling conflicted about being with my SO [23F] of 4 years due to attraction.\nPOST: I have had a wonderful relationship with my SO for 4 years now. We met online at first and visited each other often, we lived together during breaks and summers until she graduated college and are now living together permanently as I continue my degree. She is the best person I could ask for in a girlfriend. We have complimenting personalities, rarely fight, and just love to be with each other. However, she is a bit overweight (5'5'' / ~150 lbs). When I look into her eyes, she is the most beautiful person in the world to me. But when I see he in comparison to previous girlfriends / girls around campus in general, I have very shallow thoughts. I hate myself for it. I have always had these lingering thoughts once in a while, it's kind of a cycle. I normally try to get rid of these thoughts by appreciating her other assets. The worst part? She had bulimia problems in the past when she was younger, and I just feel terrible that these thoughts even enter my mind. We work out together, and she has lost a little weight over the course of 4 years. I always look longingly at the girls on campus, and my heart wrenches if they ever flirt with me. She has always been very self conscious. I have never seen her fully naked, for example; she always has something covering the middle area. In terms of our sex, I would put it at a solid good. It could be better, but it certainly isn't bad.\n\nWhat I think: I think I'm a greedy asshole that doesn't fully appreciate what he has, and if I were to ever move on from this woman it would be the biggest mistake of my life. But as I say that, the small voice in the back of my head says \"but what if it's a mistake to stay?\"\n\nIt would be unfair to simply ask \"what should I do?!\" So I suppose my question is, \"is this normal?\" I am hoping this is just a phase of my instincts wanting to \"spread the seed.\"\nTL;DR:"}

When seeing a guy, even after seeing him many times, my mind goes blank- I become meek and shy, and I am not fun to be around. I sound stupid and just become overwhelmed by the anxiety, and by the end of the night I've shut down. I've tried deep breathing but my mind is still on overload. Sometimes I'll \"ride\" the anxiety and become overly enthusiastic and my mind will race out loud when I'm talking to the guy. My poor behavior makes me feel bad and thus I become evasive about scheduling plans and stuff. \n\nI thought about it and I think the root of it as it relates to dating, is that I'm very worried about rejection. I feel like every sentence that comes out of my mouth is \"wrong\" - based on feedback I've gotten on sites like this and in person, like \"saying things like I miss you will scare him away\" or \"don't talk about your problems- be vulnerable - but don't tell him why he shouldn't date you.\"\n\nI'm otherwise a normal person and I do like myself.

Since then, I've taken a year off, running only once every few weeks, or even less. A little while ago, I started running again in earnest. I've stayed in pretty good shape because I'm very active and walk all day. I did lose speed, but my endurance didn't suffer as badly as I thought it would. I did about six workouts over the course of a week and a half that consisted of two 45 minute runs, two speed sessions, and two hill workouts. \n\nBack when I was actually training, I never had any problem with shin splints. I have gained some weight since then (I used to be sickly skinny), but I now weigh about 150 and am 5'9'', which is a pretty healthy weight. I am also very flexible, and my legs are now stronger than they used to be due to strength training. After those six workouts, I had a shin splint in my left leg, so I took a week off of running (I did continue yoga and strength training). Yesterday I went out for a run and ended up going for an hour because I felt really good, despite the nagging pain in my left shin Afterwards, I iced both my legs, elevated them, rehydrated and refueled, and did little walking for the rest of the night. I even slept with my left leg elevated (though when I woke up it was no longer elevated). This morning my leg feels like someone snapped it half and repaired it with paper clips or something. I mean, not so bad that I think it's a stress fracture, but bad enough that it'd be a stupid idea to do my scheduled workout. So when is this damn shin pain going to go away?!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [27/f] I'm having trust issues with my husband [27/m]\nPOST: A little background:\nHusband and I have been married for 5 years, no kids. Last year, he and I  almost split up after he admitted to having feelings for a much younger coworker. He didn't physically cheat, but there was an emotional affair between them.  It got to a point where he even said he wasn't sure he was still in love with me, and we did consider divorce.  After spending just under 2 weeks apart, we got back together, and things have been going ok for the most part since.  He also transferred to another work location with the same company, so he is no longer in contact with this girl.  I also made it clear that I didn't want him communicating with her via text, email, or Facebook.  \n\nThe issue:\nThere are times when I have this urge to go through his phone and check his messages to see if he's been calling/texting/IM'ing her.  That's actually how I found out about their \"affair\" the first time, so I've learned to listen to my gut feeling.  I hadn't found anything, but then again, I get the feeling that he would think ahead to delete anything before I could find it.  Today, I read a conversation he had with a mutual friend of his and this other girl from work.  My husband and I were both invited to go out to a game, and the friend mentioned that \"the girl\" was also going to be there.  I saw my husband's reply, and he said that it would just be him going.  The work friend expressed that he would like to see us both there, but it looks like my husband didn't reply.  This was 2 days ago, and my husband hasn't mentioned to me anything about us being invited to this game.  Am I being paranoid, or does it seem like he wants this opportunity to see this girl again without me knowing about it?  I'm so tempted to confront him directly, but I'm also afraid because I'd have to admit to him that I've been snooping through his phone.  Any advice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I was heartbroken, and it has taken me a long, long time to reach this point, where I now feel like I'm okay most of the time and have accepted it. \n\nHowever, he recently contacted me saying it would be nice if we could meet over the Christmas holidays for a catch up. I very much doubt this is anything other than him genuinely wanting a catch up, he likes to stay friends with a lot of his past dates/lovers. I've never really understood why he does but he does, and I'm sure I'm just another ex that he'd like to stay in touch with and he must feel like enough time has now passed since the break-up for us to meet.\n\nI initially said yes, and told him to let me know when he's back in town and we'd arrange something. However this past weekend he messaged me saying he is free this week and for some reason, I just didn't want to meet him anymore. I valued his time in my life and our time together a lot, he taught me a lot, but now that is over and I don't really think it's necessary to force a friendship. I'd rather keep the memory of what we were than try and rebuild a broken relationship into a friendship. Plus, it's taken me so long to get here and seeing him again might stir up old feelings. I can't risk going back to that place. \n\nSo I made some very vague excuse about actually being pretty busy these next few weeks and he said it was no trouble, I think deep down he knew I was making excuses because I didn't want to see him. \nIt felt like the right thing to do, but I feel quite down about it now.

We talked about a ton of stuff, from pets, to mutual friends, to sexuality. When we finally got to her place, we simply let the song finish that was playing, and then we hugged. Not a very long hug, but not terribly short one either. But this is the most intimate thing we've ever done in the ten years that we've been friends.\n\nShe identifies as a lesbian, but has told me of notions where she was wanting to make out with a guy (last night, actually). \n\nSo I don't how know to go on. I really want to tell her, but I'm always terrified that I'll muck up the current friendship that we already have, and I'm not sure I could deal with that. I have no way to know how she feels without just directly asking her, and that puts as much of an awkward strain on the friendship as me telling her.\n\nSo, should I tell her, and how?\nTL;DR:"}

I was warned by my landlord that some of those workers might come in to do some last minute inspections this afternoon. Which is fine except...\n\nI'm at work currently and my GF is in my apartment. She just texted me and told me that some workers came in and asked if they could take a picture of the apartment. She didn't really convey the context of the conversation very well (if they were taking it for their records to document that the apartment is finished, taking pictures of defects or blemishes etc...). But she did say that it seemed like they were just taking a general picture of my living room. Which I find a bit disturbing. On the innocent side, my GF just said he mentioned that he didn't think anyone had moved in yet. So he's either lying to make it sound innocent or wasn't expecting anyone to be in and just needed a picture for documentation.\n\nThere is a keypad entry to the only door into my building, and my door has a deadbolt. I'm worried that the construction worker may be planning on selling the picture and keypad combination to a thief. Leaving only my deadbolt to be pried open with a pry bar.

I love him to death, he makes me happy, all that good stuff. \n\nHere's my problem. \n\nMy past two relationships were very unhealthy and at times abusive. I was constantly cheated on, lied to, manipulated etc. It was a rough time, but I got out of it, took several months to get myself back together, and that's when I decided to start dating again. And then life happened and my SO and I ended up together. \n\nIn the very early stages of our relationship, he had a brief affair with his ex, whom he had been with since our sophomore year. I was heartbroken, he was angry at himself, and it was just a mess. We tried to patch things up, but there were still some road bumps. Eventually we both sat down and talked it out, took a week away from each other without any contact (as opposed to seeing each other almost daily), and in the end got our shit straight. He went completely no contact with his ex, blocked and deleted her on all social media, and put all his effort into repairing our relationship. \n\nIt's been several months now, and we're better than ever. We're moving towards getting our own place, starting careers. All that good stuff. Trust has been rebuilt on a logical level, and I feel great about the future. \n\nMy issue is, thanks to my severe anxiety issues and shitty past experiences, I get random bursts of worry that he'll leave me/cheat on me/something of that nature. I know it's probably all chemical, because logically I know he isn't. He doesn't hide anything from me, we can talk about anything. I'm currently not in treatment for m anxiety due to insurance issues, and I know that will help. But what can I do in the meantime? Is there anything I can do to talk my thought process out? Maybe something he and I both could do to help me chill out? It really is a random occurrence. Nothing sketchy triggers it. I'll just be sitting there, and out of the blue, my brain goes into panic mode.\nTL;DR:"}

First off, throwaway account. Secondly, the story that is driving a stake in my heart.\n\nI've been married for 3 years now. Physically, my wife is gorgeous. I find her attractive in every single way possible physically. However, it's the emotional plane that has broken my heart on several occasions. I'll be honest and say she has cheated on me. Although that was only a one time occurrence, she has continually lied to me.\n\nReddit, this is the difficult part. Is it lying if someone omits part of what they've done? Situation is this: I worked this past Saturday, on top of my 40+ hour work week. I bust my ass trying to bring home as much as possible so that our family can survive. My wife has lied before, so I asked her what she did all day Saturday while I was away. Her reply was \"Not much, homework, reddit, that's about it\"\n\nWith her history of lying, I know to be weary of her responses. I don't keep tabs on her anymore because the better part of me wants to believe and instill trust. However, Saturday's response was a bit... different. I decided to find the root of her chrome directory and read her history. She had spent the better part of Saturday browsing r/ladyboners and various other questionable items. If we had a normal, loving relationship, I'd say that it was OK with me for my wife to be visually finding items that excite her. However, as we've had multiple occurances of her being unfaithful, I found that her omitting the truth was a little less than desirable.\nTL;DR:"}

Before sending any messages, I decided to do a quick FB search to see if she was legit. I found her profile in no time and started to scroll through her public profile. As I was doing this, I accidentally hit the \"add friend\" button with my thumb. This sent me into panic. I immediately cancelled my friend request and blocked her for good measure. Once I calmed down, I started to think that maybe this whole mistake might go unnoticed. However, I later found out when you send a friend request, FB automatically sends a email to the recipient. So even though I cancelled the friend request, she will still get an email saying that I want to add her as a friend.\n\nI figure it would be pretty easy for her to connect the dots once she sees that email. There is the off-chance that she disabled her email notifications but I'm not counting on it. I decided to send her a message through CMB anyways - without mentioning my fuck up.

Our roommate doesn't pay rent and he doesn't have a job or pay for weed. He just sleeps on the couch and cleans the apartment. \n\nNow, I would love to say it doesn't bother me. Maybe it shouldn't. But it does. My boyfriend and I work 40 hours a week. I can't smoke anymore because of my work.\n\nI have tried talking to him. He gets so mad at me because he says it is a way for him to relax at the end of the day. I understand, but 150 a week... I dont know. I feel like the \"uncool\" girlfriend that doesn't want her boyfriend to smoke pot. I just want him to smoke less.\n\nSince then, he has never been in the mood for sex. He never wants to go on dates with me (I offer to pay every time.) He won't come to bed with me before 4am and he doesn't acknowledge me unless I make him and our room mate food. \n\nIm so done.

Decided to get back together with cheating ex after I (23f) found out I was pregnant.\nPOST: Never posted before so I'll try to keep this short. My bf(22) and I had been dating for 3 years when I find out I was pregnant. That same week, I was contemplating breaking up with him because he had become very distant all of a sudden and seemed disinterested. I didn't act because of the pregnancy. \n\nA few months later he dropped the bomb: he had been cheating on me over the past yr or so with several different people...and he wanted to get back together with one of his exes. We broke up but obviously it could not be a traditional breakup because of our coming child (abortion and adoption were out of the question for me).\nWe went to counseling together to try to work things out for the bsby's sake. We ended up reignited that fire and moved in together about for months ago. Our baby is 2 months old now and for any if you who have kids, you know sex is pretty low on the list at first. \n\nI'm still super insecure that he will do this to me again and now that the elation of a newborn is starting to fade as we set back into real life, he's become more distant again and always seems annoyed at me. I'm still really hurt and I question all the time if I did the right thing by staying with him. Now we live together and have a kid so it is so much harder to just leave...if I even want to! About half the time we are so happy together but lately the low parts have been really low. I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

Looking for input.\nPOST: I've known my girlfriend for about 2 years, when we started hooking up I voiced my opinion about her smoking cigarettes and she promised she would quit for me. Shortly thereafter she claimed that she started to use an electronic cigarette and then shortly after that she supposedly had completely given it up. By the time we started dating, as far as I knew, she had completely given it up and I was very proud of her, but I was always skeptical and always asked if she had smoked anything at all (including ecigs) and she always said no. \n\nWell, yesterday I went to move her car for her and found packs of cigs in her car door, a lighter, and receipts with her credit card for cigarettes. So I confronted her about it and long story short she lied her ass off and said they were her moms and she didn't know they were there (Her mom does smoke too) and that she hasn't smoked anything at all. She came at me with anger for not trusting her and swore on **her father's ashes, her mother's life, and my own life** that she gave it up, and so I let it go, despite not believing her.\n\nHowever, once she fell asleep I snagged her iPhone and searched for 'cigs' in her messages and saw a bunch of recent text messages from her to her mom reminding her mom to leave her cigarettes at home or to make to sure to buy cigarettes as well as one to a friend saying 'I am in my driveway smoking mad cigarettes right now I don't even know why.'\n\nI kicked her out once I saw the text messages. It's not about the smoking - its about the lying. Curious as to how I should try and go about trusting her about anything going forward If I don't break up with her for this.\nTL;DR:"}

I've lurked for a long time, but finally had a reason to post. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, and have had a solid relationship. Like most couples we've had a few spats, but he's my best friend and has become my total support system. He's my first real relationship, and one of the few people I feel totally comfortable with.  \n\nWe're graduating in 5 weeks, and I'm planning on moving across the country to be closer to my family in Seattle, while he is staying in Virginia, where we go to school. \n\nLast night he initiated a conversation about potentially breaking up. To say it broke my heart would be an understatement. I have no delusions about us staying together long-distance (I don't know how long I'm going to live in Seattle for, but at least a few years) but I never saw us breaking up so early. His reasoning is that he's starting a new job in DC shortly after graduation, and with so many changes, doesn't want to add being single to that list. \n\nI would so much rather prefer to stay together for these last few weeks, and get to do all the fun stuff that senior year brings. Additionally, my social circle changed when we were dating, and most of my good friends come from my relationship with him. I don't think I could stand to lose my boyfriend, and all my friends with 5 weeks to go senior year. \n\nBasically, I don't know what to do. I have a midterm today, but can't focus on anything. He said his mind isn't made up yet, but it's something we should spend the next few days thinking about. I think he's leaning toward breaking up. I think I just need advice on how to handle it if we do break up - I don't have many friends I feel comfortable talking about this with.\nTL;DR:"}

Because of cultural differences it seems incredibly unlikely that a relationship would ever work out with a local girl, much less that we'd have much in common. I'm not ruling it out though.\n\nSo I've been going to local meetings of foreigners, and have pretty much met all the local expats. I'm a pretty shy person and I'm sick of going out to the bars where we meet, but I'm making friends and occasionally having opportunities to hang out in more intimate places, which is nice.\n\nBut a couple days ago, I started feeling really worried about ever having a girlfriend. As I said, I've pretty much met all the foreigners in the area, and among them, I only really immediately felt comfortable around one. Turned out we have a lot in common, too. We went on a couple of what I thought were dates, just us two, I was starting to feel infatuated so I mentioned how comfortable I feel...and she apologized and told me she's gay.\n\nThis doesn't really bother me, I was getting a little carried away, and it's silly to expect anything so soon anyway...okay, it kind of does bother me, only because I've always sort of wished I *were* a woman, but that isn't my issue.\n\nThe thing is, as I've said I've pretty much met everyone I can, and if anything I want to go to less of these awkward (for me) meetups, but I haven't met anyone I felt I'd like to date. It seems like there simply isn't a suitable person in my city, and it's difficult to imagine going the next five years without at least pursuing romance. Is it normal to feel this way? Should I try to be more open-minded about meeting local women? Should I try being a bit more friendly with some of the other foreign women and see if something might develop, even if we don't have a lot in common on the surface?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I'm sober, he drinks every night\nPOST: I'm 22f, my boyfriend is 26m. We've been dating for about three years, we don't live together. For the first two years of our relationship we never drank together, he would come over to my place on weekends, stay for a couple hours, and then go home and drink by himself. It wasn't a very serious relationship, just fun while we were still in school. Within the last year things started getting much more serious, and I started spending nights at his place. I was pretty surprised when I realized how often he drinks. He generally has six or more drinks a night, hard liquor, and doesn't like to go without. I don't want to impose my will on him or anything, but I have a lot of concerns about how this will effect his health, and how it's currently effecting our relationship. He frequently cancels plans with me because he's too sad, and would rather go home, have a few drinks, and go to bed. He has a lot of depression and I've seen a significant difference between periods where he drinks heavily and ones where he drinks more moderately. Whenever he's upset over something he drinks a lot more than usual, and to me it looks like he loses control over it. I've tried discussing this with him, and he simply tells me he doesn't have a problem with it, and his drinking helps him deal with other issues. He says it makes him happy and helps him relax after a stressful day of work, so he sees no reason to cut it out of his life. Am I being too critical and should just trust that he knows what he's doing? I've also never been around anyone who drinks every night, and I'm wondering if I may be exaggerating the seriousness of six drinks a night. I have issues just like anyone else, so I wouldn't want to press the matter if it's something that's not really that big of a deal.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend (34m) and I (28f) have been seeing each other for over 2 years. I would like to move in with him, except he already owns a house that I cannot afford to pay half the mortgage for. He makes about 10 times as much as I do. He is a successful lawyer, and I am starting a business that is going well, but I don't earn nearly as much as he does and never will. He lives in a 3 bedroom house in a nice area of los angeles, so it costs a decent amount of money. I make more than enough to support myself, but I live in a fairly cheap place. Paying for half the mortgage and bills would be pretty much my whole income. We have talked about it, and he will never come out and say it, but I know he doesn't want me to move in because of money. I spend most of my time there anyway. I go back to my place like twice a month or so. I think it's stupid for me to pay rent on a place I spend so little time at.

It was a very unexpected breakup and I'm having a very very hard time getting over it. All of our mutual friends were in shock when it happened.\n\nI'm feeling a lot of things. First and foremost I've begun to question my own interests and desires for life, wondering if I'm truly happy. The truth is I don't really know. I've fallen into a sort of pit of depression and I'm really struggling to pull myself out. Second, I'm occasionally feeling bitter or angry. I know my girlfriend said she just outgrew the relationship, but I can't help but feel like she might have just been going through a slight lull and decided to just abandon it. I've poured my heart and soul into being the best boyfriend I could be for 2 years, and it was an amazing relationship right up until the day she decided to end it. I don't want to feel anger or bitterness toward her, because deep down I know she's done nothing wrong.\n\nThe worst part of it all is that all of the people I've shared the last 2 and a half years of my life with were mutual friends of ours, and now that she's broken up with me, they've all suddenly disappeared from my life. I'm finding that I have absolutely no emotional support or comfort from anyone. I'm an only child who doesn't have a very close relationship with my parents, and I now have no friends to turn to either.\n\nIt's only really hit me now that I'm home from college for the holidays and don't really have anything to do. I've been sitting in my room listening to angry music and writing sad songs on guitar, but it pains me to know that my ex is out having fun and enjoying herself with the friends that we used to share, while I'm stuck here feeling sad with no one to turn to and no idea what I want to do with my life.\nTL;DR:"}

For the first month or two I managed to block it out, have fun, date others. However it has been creeping back to my mind for the last several weeks. \n\nI have definitely been heartbroken in the past, and it usually is attributed to something obvious I did to ruin the relationship, or there was someone else in the picture, or there was a clear issue with the relationship (ie. long distance). These were all extremely difficult and painful to get over, but what helped was that I knew in all of them that they weren't good relationships or there was an obvious explanation. This time around, I have no idea why he ended it. All I know is it was not because of another girl - and while I can speculate if I nitpick, I really have no idea why he broke up with me. This, and the fact that we actually did have a really good thing going makes me even more baffled and truly incapable of moving on. Does anyone have any kind of advice/similar experience and how to deal with this? My main problem right now is the desire to reach out to be friends (which I normally would never do, but that's how happy we actually were together), which brings me great pain, or to block it all out completely, which is equally painful.

The school used a site called e-notebook to keep track of student's grades and absences (some of you may be familiar with this).\n\nSo, at the beginning of 9th grade, we got a new PC installed to our classroom, which was mainly used by teachers during lessons. They usually logged in at the start and logged out at the end of the class. But one time, our biology teacher forgot to do so, and that's where the FU begins.\n\nONe of my classmates noticed this and thought that it would be a good idea to \"improve\" his grades by adding a few 'A'-s to her grades. But she didn't stop there. Soon, most of the class gathered around the computer asking her to the same thing  for them too. Finally, around 20 'A'-s were added for 13 different students (I was one of them), then they logged out of the teacher's account. The only detail that we missed was that some of the teachers have thier own notebooks to keep track of things as a backup. So it didn't take too long to realize the difference between the two. Idiot us.\n\nA few hours later, the head theacher rushed in in the middle of the lesson and asked these 13 students to go to her office immediately. We were scared as fuck because we knew we got busted. We were all sat to separate rooms and asked to write down everything we did that day. It was really an unexpected situation, so some of us admitted the fraud, others kept telling they did nothing.

I think nothing of it as we were friends anyway, but when we arrive she decides it's too busy for bowling and we should go for dinner instead. I reluctantly agree and we have a friendly meal and I try to keep my distance so as to not lead her on.\nWe then meet some friends back at her place where one of them says to me \"Well done with remove name-the friend by the way!\". I think this is a bit weird anyway but then she starts leaning all over me and getting a bit...cosy.\nI slowly realise that everyone sort of assumes we are a couple. Bear in mind we had been on one semi-date that very day!

When we are back there I try to act too ill to do anything except sleep but she essentially jumps me as soon as we are alone.

I've always lived up to this, because I think it'd be awkward and unattractive to do in front of people other than my family, but I digress.\nSo I pass out on the couch, and I vaguely remember waking up a few times and talking to them. One of the times, I was scooting down so his friend could sit on the couch. I remember saying something, and he responded with \"But girls don't fart!\" I remember laughing, farting, and falling back asleep while they all laughed too. If I was awake, this totally wouldn't have been something I'd do but.. I can't remember if it really happened or if it was a dream. I also remember waking up later, and crawling back up on the couch to my original spot when my boyfriend was wanting to crash, so I know I moved down for his friend..\nThe following morning, I wake up, extremely confused wondering if it really happened or was a dream. My boyfriend wakes up and looks at me with this slight smile, and then proceeds to tell me how much he loves me. It seemed really random from him.. It might be because he thought it was funny, or it might have been because it was one of our last few days together. I'm too afraid to find out which, but it haunts me.\nTL;DR:"}

Campus is relatively safe but immediately off campus can get pretty bad especially at night.\n\nShe seems to think that I am refusing to let her go out which is making her mad because when i go out without her she always just says have a good time. I feel like there is a difference in this situation because of the unfamiliarity with the area and then being girls going to a strangers house. I a 6'5\" 220lb guy i can handle myself in most situations and i am just really concerned about them.\n\nNot to mention the fact that i checked the basketball teams roster and his name was not on it.

Polyamourous relationships.

I'm getting ready to go another long time before I feel like asking women for their numbers, or to do something after whatever event we meet at. \n\nI don't give a damn really about sex.

Two, my parents aren't the biggest fans of her.

Most of our problems arose because of my insecurities and worries about the future.\n\nLast night I spoke with my parents who seemed genuinely upset that I had broken up with her, claiming to not have had any ill feelings for her.\n\nThis is my question: Should I contact her to talk and explain myself/explore the possibility of getting back together, or should I accept that I'm not cut out for a relationship and leave her be?\nTL;DR:"}

I was just causally talking with my boss about university and part time work and the like, and was explaining about a new job I was starting in the coming weeks. I can't remember exactly what it was I said, but a comment of mine sent him into hysterics. When he'd finished laughing, he took a swig from his can of IRN-BRU (Scottish beverage, for those that aren't familiar) and was hit once again by a fit of giggles. He proceeded to choke on his drink, coughed, and ended up spitting it up into the face of one of the other managers. She stumbled backwards laughing and ended up bumping into Sean, who was knocked flailing backwards into the stack of Cardboard pizza boxes. (When stacked in bulk they can be pretty heavy) This led to the full stack coming tumbling down onto Stephanie, whom was carrying a large tub of barbecue sauce. She dropped the tub, which burst and cascaded all over the floor. It all happened so quickly that Megan (who was just passing though the kitchen) didn't have any time to react, and slipped on the spilt sauce. On her way down she made an effort to save herself and made a grab for the metal table, but In turn grabbed a box (with pizza inside) and pulled it down on top of her own face, covering herself in jalape\u00f1os and ketchup. Everyone was silent throughout the shop, before erupting into a chorus of laughter. \n\nWhile this wasn't entirely/technically my fault, I am still blamed for the incident. \nYou could say it was, a domino effect.\nTL;DR:"}

We've lived together for two years. We moved out of a cheap, shitty, month-to-month place into a nice place with a year lease. Three months in and I am more unhappy than ever and have decided to move back home and break it off with him. We still live together pretty civilly for now. We've been friendly, semi-still acting like we're in our relationship while we both figure out the moving situation.\n\nHe just realized today that we would be splitting the cost of breaking the lease, rather than me paying the full cost by myself. I have a full-time steady job, but I make about $200 a week. His job is not steady--though he always seems to find work--and he makes about $600 a week. Rent is $850 a month. \n\nI argued that he can afford to live here without me, thus it is his decision to break the lease, which costs $1000. I am more than happy to split the cost, but he thinks I should pay in full, because I am technically breaking the lease by leaving, since my name is on the lease. \n\nI don't think this is fair. We have always split the rent and bills perfectly even, even though he makes a lot more money than I do. Even if he is unable to find work for a period, he can file and receive unemployment for that time, and he also has a savings of about $6,000 that he can pull from.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been in love with him for the past year and have tried to move on to no avail. In this conversation he also said he loved me, which was news to me. The thing is, we broke up because he has a lot of stress in his life right now. He's a founder of a startup that's launching their product in June, he's trying to graduate (also in June) and has some family and financial troubles unrelated to the first two stressors. \n\nIn November, we took a break because he was too stressed and our relationship was just adding to that stress because he felt he wasn't performing up to his own standards. I understood that he was busy and while we didn't get to spend as much time together as I wanted, he still made me very very happy. \n\nWe both want to be together but he has zero time outside of his startup and school so he said we can't be together now but things will get better after their product launch and his graduation.

The dude was absolutely insane and ultimately destroyed the person my girlfriend used to be. The dude was a real cook, according my girlfriend he went to a renowned psycologist and his case was extremely interesting to the psycologist. The kid abused my girlfriends goodwill and trust. She sacrificed her welfare for a year and a half to try and make this kid happy but in response all she would get were depricating insults, minor physical abuse, and an inability to express her own feelings. All the ex-boyfriend would get from her would be sympathy and whenever he would get it, he would throw it back in her face with very demeaning insults. Then one day he was really sad and she showed little interest (obviously acceptable) and he responded by cutting himself in order to recieve the sympathy that he never once appreciated. The kid was just absolutely insane. There's more too but hopefully you get the point. She lost her old personality becase now she always depressed And is now on zolaft. Ive tried telling her multiple times not to dwell in the padt tat you cant change, dont forget about it because you should learn from this experience, but just dont let it bring you down, focus on your future and present instead. It just doesnt seem to be working, everything i do, its very hard for me becusde it makes me seem powerless. Worst of all, our relationship is suffering drastically on an emotional level because fears that ill just be another shitty relationship, she is afraid to install her trust into me and to be vulnerable again.

We have talked about moving in together in my apartment because she hates her roomates, I pretty much see her everyday. We flirt all the time and we pretty much had phone sex already and have talked about doing it if we were dating, I should mention we kissed just the other day after a date having sushi.

He's currently in the navy but he's supposed to be coming back soon. Anyways she has hinted that she loves him, but she talks about how shes broken up with him countless times because hes a dick and from what I hear, he used to do hard drugs like cocaine, crack and stuff like that even in front of her which is a huge reason they broke up and he promised that he'd stop doing it but she caught him again recently and is giving him another chance.

Eglin to be exact. We lived in a trailer park. (People would move in and out all the time because of the military. We weren't trashy or anything.) In the middle of the trailer park there was a playground/park area. It was pretty basic you could climb it, slide on it, walk and play underneath it, etc. There was also this little piece about 20ft away from the park. It was just a crawl tube, a wall, and a clear dome thing to look through. (Relevant later) Well, one day me and my friends got bored and we started digging underneath the main playground. (sand) We would dig for hours, just to see how far we could go. We then realized there were tons of other kids around who could do this work for us. I was 8-9 my friends were 10-13. We decided to start making other kids dig for us. We weren't going to do manual labor damn it. So we started getting other kids my age and younger dig for us. If they didn't listen to us, my older friends would drag them to the side tube thing and make them sit there. Here's the kicker. No one wanted to run home and pee, so we would just pee in that tube thing. It wasn't rly part of the park. Soo yeah...\n\nPlus side: We dug so deep we broke a water line, the giant whole filled with water and we could wade/swim under the playground.\nTL;DR:"}

So I was riding the bus home from school and was sitting across from my brother and his classmate let's call him Mitch, and as a hot high school girl walked by I heard Mitch mutter \"sexy\" to her. Now remember I was a stupid little kid, and I just thought that \"sexy\" meant something more like nice (not in sexual way, but like a nice personality) or whatnot. So I decided to try out this new word. So I told a fellow male classmate (let's call him Bill), \"HEY BILL, I THINK YOU'RE SEXY!\" My brother and Mitch started laughing hysterically, and I didn't know how to react. Bill gets mad at me and I didn't know how to react, and this leads to a fight. In the fight it looks like we are wrestling or something, so my brother and Mitch laugh even harder. Bill and I were so damn innocent, so we just kept fighting/wrestling. By the end of the bus ride my brother told me what \"sexy\" actually meant and I felt so goddamn stupid. I'm straight and this experience had to be one of the most embarrassing ones of my life, despite my innocence.\nTL;DR:"}

For all intents and purposes, though, please assume that this is me. \n--\nI've dated \"Carmen\" for 2 years, and it's been wonderful. She spent some teenage years abroad in the United States, and she manifests herself in more \"liberated\" ways than other women here. Sex life has been good, too. We recently went on a small vacation together where everything was fine. \n\nRecently, we had an argument about some trivial subjects, including her contributions to our dating expenses. We are both students, but my part time job pays more than hers. Still, she paid almost nothing even though she makes 60% of what I do. This would not be a problem (I can understand that she might have more student loans, more difficult family situation, etc), except for the fact that she spends irresponsibly on her personal items, such as buying expensive make-up, shoes, clothes, etc. \n\nThis \"fight\" led to us not talking for a while. In that time, I learned that she had gone to a male friend of hers, whom I do not know, who is a professional photographer. She posed nude for him for a series of photos, and sent them to me a few days later. While I begrudgingly admit the artistic merit of some of them, they were overtly sexual and provocative, and definitely involved full nudity. Even featured some sex toys I recognized (no penetration of any kind, however). She also hinted that she thinks the photographer is interested in her, but maintained that she did not \"do anything.\" \n\nI'm at a loss. I can't even figure out what is going on in this girl's head. I don't know if I should be mad or how much. The original argument seems to pale in response to this. How do I respond?\nTL;DR:"}

I know if I tell him the reason it will crush him. \n\nI don't think he suspects I am unhappy either. I haven't mentioned it to him, because there isn't anything he can do about it.

Now up until I'd say mid-February it's been strictly platonic. One kiss over a year ago that we agreed meant nothing, and since then I've had a girlfriend, so it's been a fairly straightforward \"just friends\" relationship. \n\nBack in February I decided to act on these more-than-friends feelings and decided to tell her about it. She just brushed off the conversation like it didn't happen, until the week of March Break (Canadian, sorry it's March Break to me not Spring Break). During March Break we had a long talk and she revealed that the day after the current day we were at, she wanted me to come over to see how more than friends would be like. Unfortunately I'm an idiot and got completely drunk the night before and wasn't able to move the next day, where she than said it was probably for the best.\n\nThen about a month ago now, we decided to really talk about it and after I gave a huge speech about how I felt about her going but to a year ago, she told me that while she had feelings for me that way she knew there would be no point to pursue them because we would end up breaking up anyways, something which comes from the fact that her parents are divorced themselves.\n\nSince then we've had a couple fights about it, coming from me saying she clearly doesn't feel for me that way or she'd give it a chance, and her saying it's just as hard for her as it is for me, which I've had trouble believing. Last night was the biggest of these fights, and I ended up telling her I needed time to think, as I'm not sure if I should stop talking to her until these feelings go away, or to just keep talking to her and try to act plautonic again, something which fucking blows when you're hanging out alone and would just like to not be plautonic.\n\nSome advice would be greatly appreciated, I know this is pretty long but it would be a great help.\nTL;DR:"}

Our house was unlocked during this time to allow guests access to the bathroom.  After the ceremony and picture-taking, my dad disappeared for a good half hour.\n\nMy sister went inside to use the bathroom and noticed that the door to the spare room (AKA the cats' room) was closed.  She could smell the crack being smoked (my dad was an addict when I was a child so this isn't quite coming out of nowhere).  She knocked on the door and asked if anyone was in there to which he replied in a panicked voice \"No, no one is here.\" After he finally came back out to join the festivities, my sister brought my mom inside, who confirmed her suspicions (side note, my parents are divorced so my mom would have had no idea whether or not my dad was using again).  Afterwards my husband (who lived near a crack house as a kid) also confirmed the smell.\n\nMy 10 year old cat, whom I've had from 3 months old, doesn't like loud noises or lots of people. She was hiding underneath the bed in the spare room. My dad smoked crack with my cat trapped in the room. Granted, he had no way of knowing he committed an act of animal cruelty, but he should have never been doing drugs in our house in the first place.\n\nI'm incredibly saddened and angry.  My husband doesn't even want to deal with my dad, and this one incident ruined his entire perception of our wedding day, which had otherwise gone perfectly.  We're both incredibly hurt as my dad had paid for the majority of our wedding.  How do I deal with my dad going forward?  We have no concrete proof to confront him with and he is prone to escalating situations and completely deflecting any blame.  Neither of us want him at our house again but we don't know how to communicate it since we have no proof.\nTL;DR:"}

She was doing relatively okay the days after the attacks, even walking past some tourist sights with her brother (who was visiting her over the weekend).\nHowever, with new events unfolding everyday she is beginning to feel very unsafe. I just got off skype with her. She was crying, saying she doesn't want to be there anymore and she's scared of going outside.\n\nThe last few days I kept reassuring her how unlikely it is, that there will be new attacks soon. But now there was a new shootout with police during a raid in Paris. One women blew herself up. The last few days metro lines are getting shut down constantly by the police.

But she says she doesn't think she could live well if she would have seen people die. I also totally understand that statistics don't really help when you're scared. Of course I try to distract her, talk about other things, make her laugh. But that doesn't really work. She keeps reading news articles, stories from victims, etc and wants to talk about them.\n\nI feel like the only thing I can do is talk about it rationally when she wants to, give her time and try to distract her as good as I can when she's open for it. Is there anything I should do differently? I didn't know what to say when she started crying today. I felt helpless, like there was nothing I could do.

Recently, feelings have entered the picture by both of us and we are slowly getting a bit more serious.\n\nNormally when a guy likes me, he texts me constantly. He (Bo) does not do that. When I am with him he is very sweet and affectionate. When I am not with him he doesn't really do anything to show he has feelings for me. Tired of being confused by his mixed signals I decided I would leave him alone. If he wanted me he would come to me; I was done trying. I didn't tell him I had decided this. I just wasn't going to pursue him anymore.\n\nA day after I decided this, like he could feel my mood change, he sent me a text message that essentially said that he hoped we were okay, that I'm not the first girl who thought he didn't give a damn, that he's trying to do better to make sure that the people whose company he likes and wants to keep knows he wants it, and that he hopes this was a step in the right direction. I was happy he said that as it made me make sense of some things and I stayed at his house that night and it was great.\n\nI expected us to now be on a more serious track, but he still does not text me often. When a guy likes me, I am used to him texting me a lot, wanting to hang out a lot, asking when he can see me next. Bo rarely does this, and it hurts my feelings. He even will go a whole day without speaking to me. He claims he is just extremely bad at relationships, but I don't see how it can be this hard. I am not sure what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

I also have a huge lack of friendships, which scares me because if we break up I won't really have anyone to fall back on. I've sort of expressed this to him too, but I try to be careful with that because I don't want it to sound like me saying, \"You can't break up with me, because I won't have anything left.\" That's a scary weight on someone's shoulders that no one wants to bear. He's generally very much there for me through all my emotional ups and downs and breakdowns, but I can tell that a lot of times it's too much for him.

Apparently, she got into some trouble at the start of the summer and was sentenced to spend a semester in juvie. Her strong academic record persuaded the judge to let her out of the hall during the day to attend regular school. However, she's due back each evening and has to spend weekends and holidays in lockup too. \n\nI guess it's a positive sign that she does well in school. I'm hoping this means she wasn't a habitual troublemaker. I would also like to hope that my daughter, who is a very positive young woman, can be a good influence on her. However, as we all know, influence can work both ways. Should I be concerned about their friendship at all? It would help if I knew what she was convicted of, but even my daughter doesn't know.

So, essentially, it is too late for me ever to minor/double major in a business field at my current university, and because I'm going to be taking at least a semester at my current university, I'd have to take another whole semester to get the required credits to graduate from another (as most universities require that you get a certain amount of credits from them to get a degree, usually around 60 or 4 semesters worth), meaning it's too late to transfer to a university that would be better suited for what I want my degree program in.\n\nSo, I'm freaking out because I've worked shitty dead end jobs and don't want to be stuck doing them forever, and I don't want to go and get my Master's/PhD, because I'm tired of going to university.\nTL;DR:"}

One is my wife's and the other two are mine. I only intended to have one vehicle for me... A little over a year ago I got a loan right under $40k for a Subaru WRX STI that had a fair purchase price of about $33k. The increased amount is due to being upside down on the car I traded in, doc fees, taxes, and a warranty I added.\n\nAfter about 8 months of owning the car, it lost the appeal it used to have. After moving closer to my office, my round trip commute to work went from being roughly 35 miles to being only 4. I started to feel like this expensive fast car wasn't being used enough to justify the ~$600/month payment. At this point I started to look around for a car with a cheaper monthly payment that I wouldn't feel guilty about not driving it a lot. I ended up signing a 4 year lease on a new car to get a payment for ~$250/month. I signed the lease quickly because the car was the color I wanted and had the options I was looking for, but I still had my STI.\n\nI didn't want to trade the STI in toward the lease of the new car due to the trade-in value being MUCH less than what I could get by selling it privately. Turbo'd Subaru's have a very high resell value, and in the area I live in, its even higher. Almost always selling for over book price. The STI being the Subaru with the highest resell value. I thought I was only $2k away from being able to sell the STI and break even, but I was like $6k away...\n\nFast forward to today, 5 months later, I've been paying two payments: $250/month for the lease, and $600/month for the STI. A few of those months I paid $1k or more on the STI to get the amount owed down quicker. I'm in a position now where I could pay down the STI, sell it, and break even. Or I could sell the leased car and use the same money to help hit the payoff amount on the lease.\nTL;DR:"}

In fact, the times that we spent visiting each other have been the best times of my life. \n\nHowever, my girlfriend also suffers from pretty terrible depression. In the past few months especially, there are a lot of nights where she gets into horrible moods and is unable to have a basic conversation with me. She mostly spends these nights talking about how shit she is, how I've lost interest in our relationship how downhill our relationship has gotten, etc. When I try to cheer her up or defend myself when she insults me, she completely ignores what I've said and picks on how I've said it. Then she manipulates how I've said it into something completely different, that makes me look like I hate her. Honestly, she can turn literally everything I say into something else. \n\nThis problem has gotten worse as I feel like I can't talk about my own feelings anymore. Whenever I talk about how I feel, she completely ignores what I said and again focuses on the words I used. Then, instead of discussing my feelings (like I do with her when she cries almost every night), she turns it into how I hate her or how she's not adequate. It's basically gotten to the point where her depression and insecurities mean that I constantly have to deal with her feelings, where I'm emotionally exhausted and upset too but she's too distraught to ever talk about how I feel.\nTL;DR:"}

We get the car \"ding\", that alerts us when there a car waiting to order. \n\nAlmost immediately after, we hear an ear piercing shriek from an upset child. Our headsets are very sensitive, and can pick up whispers some times, so you can imagine how fucking loud this raptor child was. I was peeved, but I thought \"It's late, kid is probably having a rough time.\"\n\nBut then momzilla decided to order, screaming almost louder than her kid, at the order box about what she absolutely had to have (no pleases or thank you), yelling to her kids about what they wanted.

We'd only hugged before, and he finally outright asked me for a kiss. I was happy to, but soon his hands were everywhere and I was constantly saying 'I'm not ready', 'Can we take it slow', 'I need a break', ect. I'm sure my body language was more encouraging than my words were (I am most certainly attracted to him), but I kept pulling myself away and reiterating. He didn't want to listen, or let me go, and made it very clear he had the expectation that we should have been sleeping together.\n\nI know that I am not the best at saying no to men when they push to have sex.

I don't want to feel like I'm a cruel person for leaving someone... unfulfilled, but we've only known each other about 3 weeks. \n\nAm I being misleading? Am I waiting too long or being unfair? Is it reasonable for me to expect to just kiss and hang out for a while longer?

While I was dating my first boyfriend, he(my recent ex) claimed to be in love with me and would show up at my door at all hours of the night to console me while being in love with me. My recent ex then started dating this girl for a year and a half. He claimed he was going to marry this woman and that he was the happiest man of all. Since we were both in relationships he(recent ex) confessed how he did have feelings for me before his girlfriend. I then break up with my boyfriend at the time and realize that i'd really rather be dating my recent ex. \n\nWe eventually reached a point where we were both single. ( I had left another man for him) and we start dating.  I lose my virginity to him which was a MASSIVE deal to me and I'm convinced that this man is going to be my husband\n\nSlowly the man I love slowly began to die. He stopped caring about my feelings, he stopped saying thank you, he stopped showing me he loved me, he started smoking more weed, started ditching me for his new friends. It hurt \n\nReddit i gave this man everything, i cooked, i cleaned, i did his chores, i helped pay his bills and payed for dinner, i supported everything he ever wanted to do because i just loved him so much \n\nHe then left me. I wanted to take a break because I was so tired of his selfishness and I wanted him to realize what life would be like without me. He ended up saying how he, \"couldn't do it any longer\" and that a break up is whats needed. \n\nHe hasn't msged me or called me or even spoken to his friends about our break up. He has gotten over me and its only been 2 weeks. \n\nI guess I'm asking why it is i've been so easily forgotten. My ego is really hurt and I want to know what to do next.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 19 years old, have been dating this girl 18 years old for almost 2 years. \n\nFor some time now this has been happening. She goes out with her friends and I don't say anything let her do her thing / no questions asked, she's my girlfriend not a prisoner. If I try to do anything while she might happen to be free without her she gets pissed off and goes off on me. \n\nIn addition to this, she doesn't have an open mind really. I watch whatever she wants with her for the entirety of our relationship and admittedly enjoy a majority of it so no complaints there but whenever I suggest we do something I personally like she says it's stupid and we should do something we both agree upon. \n\nLastly she's very bad at communicating, I try to express how I feel like I've been being treated unfairly, she either dismisses me or apologizes and promises to be better. Other times when I am busy she tries to text me and gets mad if i don't answer right away like at work for example. \n\nThis cycle continues nothing ever changes. Personally I don't believe it's unreasonable to want her to give some of the things I like a try or to treat me the same way i treat her. She admits she isn't this way with her friends but I don't see her trying to be any better for me.\n\nSometimes I feel like a prisoner because I let her do whatever she wants but when I want to go do something on my own or with friends instead of seeing her it is a problem. I love her good side very deeply. And I just don't know if there is something I am doing wrong or if it's her or both.\nTL;DR:"}

We greeted each other hello but didn't really get to talk much due to our seating arrangements. \n\nThis morning my boyfriend tells me that his sister wants to get me something for Christmas, and my initial reaction was \"that is absolutely unnecessary\" and he said \"I agree, I told her not to worry about it but she is insisting.. so I told her just to buy you inexpensive costume jewelry.. and then she proceeded to tell me that she wants a leather jacket for Christmas.\" \n\nI know she means the gift would be from the both of us, but I can't even afford to buy myself a leather jacket. I think that because my boyfriend mentioned that I have my own business on the side (I am an Interior Designer and have a few clients here and there) she assumes I am rolling in money. Before taking a pay cut and switching to a new job my bf worked for Goldman Sachs, and last year bought his sister a pair of really expensive boots \"to make up for all of the birthday presents he didn't get her.\" \n\nI think buying her such a luxurious gift last year spoiled her and gave her the impression that she can just email us a link to another luxurious gift. I don't even think she knows he switched jobs because she's always to busy to answer his phone calls or respond to his emails. I don't want to disappoint her when we get her a more \"appropriate\" gift, but I don't want to give in and just get her the jacket just to avoid any awkwardness. Am I over reacting?\nTL;DR:"}

We've been reading the book To Kill a Mockingbird (minor spoilers here) as a class, and we've arrived at a part in the book where a black man named Tom Robinson is put on trial for rape. My English teacher decides it'll be fun for us to act out the trial as we read it. So I'm walking into class on the day that were going to act out the trial, greet my English teacher and he asks me if I want to act. Now, I wasn't listening to him as he said this, and being the awkward pasty white boy I am I reply with \"sure\". The moment I realized that for the next 3 classes this awkward kid would be acting as a black southern man one word went through my head, fuck. That wasn't the fuck up though. Anyways, I find myself sitting alone in front of 20+ people, with my arm stuck in my shirt (Tom has one arm) who are judging me. What the fuck did I get myself into, I thought. So my teacher begins reading, then comes Tom Robinson's part. The accent I try to create is about as close to a southern black man's accent as a whale's moan. The whole class blurted out laughing at me, and luckily I didn't shit or piss myself. Apparently I sounded like a moaning cross between a Scottish man and an Irishman. The teacher stopped me and told me just to use my normal voice which resulted in more embarrassment and my face becoming red as a cherry knowing I failed in reading in a fucking accent. From there on out I was known as that guy with the shittiest accents, and picked on because of it for the rest of the school year.\nTL;DR:"}

So I have to get my rent money from my roommates and my roommates have no legal obligations.\n\nI decided that I wanted to move out into my own place by myself.

I asked my other roommate if he wanted to take over the lease and get new roommates and he said he didn't want that responsibility (I've been on my lease since I was 19. He's 25.) so I told him I was still deciding if I was going to move out or not (in which case he would have to leave as well) and if so it would be the end of July or August. He immediately asked if he could call me later and talk about it, then I clued in that it's because he would like to move out ASAP if everyone else is moving out.\n\nThe problem with that is that he's not legally obligated to give me more than a months notice as to when he's moving out, and I have to give my landlord 3 months notice as to a move out date. My other roommate (one moving out at the end of the summer) is not legally obligated to pay the portion of rent that the other guy leaves if he leaves early, leaving me to pay his share for the 3-4 months left before moving out.\nTL;DR:"}

Since he was never contacted by the hospital, insurance company, or collection agency, he tried to dispute the claims directly with Equifax/TransUnion/Experian.  All 3 agencies just replied (via email) that they verified the collections to be his, and they will not take them off of his credit report.\n\nReddit, what can we do?  Due to this, his credit score is so low (less than 500) that he can't even get a credit card. Besides that, we're students; there's no way we can pay $9000 any time soon.  We're trying to find a lawyer- but even with one, what can we expect?\nTL;DR:"}

He has this online persona that's pretty aggressive and derogatory towards women (used to always ask for girls to send nudes in his DM,etc). \n\nAnyways, we had a slight argument about me \"watching him\" and was really defensive about me looking at his Twitter. Which is weird because he knows I NEVER look at his phone/Twitter ever. He's even gone so far as to create a fake account to \"throw me off\". So I got suspicious. \n\nLong story short: he was flirting back and forth with one girl on Twitter. He lied about flirting. I showed him proof. He told me they have been DM/personal messaging. I told him to stop he blocked her off Twitter. Found out later he was snap chatting this girl after I told him to stop direct messaging. He lied and said it was just one snap saying hi to all his new followers, and he sent it to a bunch of people. Looked at his phone and there were 20+ snaps in the last 12 hours and he only sent the message to her. Asked him to block her and I see another snap from her the next day and he said the blocking must not have worked. And then he lied about not knowing how to block people. \n\nWe're going to be at different universities in September and I want to try to make this work long distance but all my trust is gone. \n\nI love him so much and he cried and said he was sorry, has deactivated Twitter and snapchat but is it just a matter of time?

I'm also afraid - be prepared for the clich\u00e9 - of directly telling him I can get insecure about his feelings towards me because I feel like, sometimes, he \"leaves me in peace too much\". Of course, maybe I'm just too needy for him and maybe we want different things from a relationship, but I've been getting confused - and this is really affecting me emotionally - because most of the time when we are together, he IS needy, and affectionate and protective and he told me he could get kind of clingy, so I don't really know what is going on. I've been trying to open my heart about myself with him but, again, I'm getting insecure and because I don't take the first steps on deeper thoughts, I think I'm not getting him comfortable and sure about getting into these conversations either, and this loop is getting me dizzy (gosh, I hope I made sense).\nTL;DR:"}

He has sworn that after a little while, we would get back together. He was genuine. I believed him.\n\nAfter a while I got a negative vibe so I asked what's up.

I get pretty irritated about this because I want to be able to share these experiences with him and I want him to be excited about these experiences, too. He's not against going out, in fact when he went abroad and when he visits home he's going out all the time. \n\nMaybe he's bored of doing the same old thing? I don't know. I do know that I tend to get in petty arguments after a night of drinking and I'm easily irked when he shows no interest in activities with my friends. \n\nLast night we argued about the same old thing but this time I was more upset than usual. I tried expressing my frustration but it just turned into another argument which then turned into me pushing him. He pushed me back and I fell onto my couch. To be frank, I think he was only defending himself for my childish behavior but it scared me. He has never been that angry with me and I've never felt so much resentment. \n\nIs this totally absurd for me to feel this way? And what should I do about this situation?\n\nAny advice would help.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25 F] with my boyfriend [25 M] 5 years, obsessed with the gym\nPOST: So here's the deal: my boyfriend of 5 years used to be overweight. He got into eating well and going to the gym about 5 years ago, and has changed his body considerably. Now, however, he has become obsessed about going! He goes 4 days a week, after work, for about 1.5 hours. I don't think this is too much: in fact, I normally go with him. The issue isn't the quantity, it's the obsessiveness of it. He CANNOT miss a day! It doesn't matter what comes up, he has a set 4 days he goes at the same time, and he will not miss it no matter what. He already works late, so it takes away a lot of our \"free\" time together in the evenings. I know it's important to him, though, which is why I'm okay with it and support him. This evening, we had a huge fight over it and I'm just not sure how to deal with it going forward. Here's a synopsis:\n\nToday was an extremely warm day, and I spent it home alone wishing he were here so we could enjoy it. Soon before he got off of work, I decided it would be fun if we skipped the gym and enjoyed the weather: we could talk, make drinks, BBQ in the backyard, etc. I suggested it to him and before I could finish talking, he walked off. I chased him and finished my request, and he just laughed and went to get ready for the gym. Finally he said if I wanted to stay home, fine, but he was going. He said if I wanted to enjoy the day I needed to tell him long in advance so he could go to the gym at some point during work. I blew up and told him I was sick of him being so rigid about this, and he stormed out (to go to the gym of course!).\n\nSo, am I being unreasonable to ask for some flexibility? Should I just let him do his thing and never interfere, or is his obsession real? Is there any advice anyone can give about how to deal with this: I don't want it to ruin our relationship and yet it seems every major fight we have somehow comes back to this!\nTL;DR:"}

I will be traveling with my wife and two boys (10 and 7) if that affects your answer. I've done a ton of research and have a pretty long list of things I want to see and do. \n\nMy biggest question is whether to rent a car (I know most people recommend) or to pay for a guided tour. \n\nRenting gives us freedom but also added stresses of planning meals, lodging, and details I'm not even aware of. I don't want to miss things because I'm focused on driving (on the other side) all of the time either. How do you plan lodging if you don't have concrete plans? Do I need to worry about finding gas stations in the Scottish highlands? We want to go to the Outer Hebrides - do we park our car and take a ferry? If it was just my wife and I it wouldn't be as much of a question but having the boys with us makes it more harder to answer.\n\nTour companies obviously work out a lot of those details for you can enjoy the ride rather than having to drive. They also provide educational information along the way. The downside is they have set itineraries. There are some family ancestry things we want to see and I'm not sure a guided tour will work for specific things like that.\nTL;DR:"}

I have met her and hung out with her before, he even told me before that she's going to be there with him that day, and I'm PRETTTYYY sure that they don't have any romantic feelings for each other...but it's the fact that he's hanging out with a girl the whole day while he can't send me one message that pisses me off.

Eventually it became a stare. Every time I looked in her direction, she was looking directly at me. I was dressed up as Han Solo, so I start thinking my costume came apart or something because I doubt a girl like that is interested in me. I'm an average, decent looking ass dude. So I go to the other room to check and I'm all good, no problems. I go back out to the living room where some friends are playing some Smash Bros. and she comes and sits by me... She whispers in my ear that she thinks I'm cute and asks if I'm with anyone and all that talk to confirm that I'm single... Fast forward and we get WASTED. She's super hot too by the way.\n\nThe night goes on and I'm playing some of my favorite songs for everyone and the party is perfect. She comes up to me and grabs my hand and starts leading me up the stairs... I'm totally about to get laid... I'm sitting on my friends bed taking off my blaster belt and she says, \"I have to use the litter box.\" I laugh because, obviously, that was a hilarious bathroom reference to her costume... Well I think to myself, \"I better use the bathroom real quick too.\" She had already left the room, so I do a quick jog across the hall to the bathroom.\nI knock.\nNo answer.\nI open the door.\nShe's squatted over the fucking litter box and now I'm the one staring... She's so drunk that she thinks this is a totally okay thing and I knew right there I wasn't about to stay hard with this image burned into my head. So I immediately walk out, and tell my friends to pack up, and it's time to roll out. I told them what I saw and they laughed uncontrollably and now they like to remind me about the time I almost fucked the \"cat girl\" on Halloween.\nYeah. What the fuck?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Do I have a chance asking for child support when I've previously not fought for it?\nPOST: TX, USA here. At the age of 19, I met a man, 27, in 2008 at work, we became involved and I found myself pregnant after four months of dating him, at the age of 20. We were married while I was pregnant and spent three years together, producing one other child. The relationship fell apart due to differences in many things and abusive behavior on his part. I couldn't stand the thought of my children being raised by a broken woman and I left. I filed for divorce, asked for nothing in the case as he had threatened me with a battle and was very insistent he would get our children and I would be paying HIM. Our 1st child was 2 yrs old and our 2nd was 6 months at the time of the divorce.  They are now 5 (almost 6) and 4. \n\nSince then I have had the children consistently 4 days a week, with our divorce decree stating once the children are in full time school I will have them at minimum 5/7 days of the week. Things have been amicable but I am beginning to regret not asking for some sort of support as I have lost my job and am having difficulties taking care of our bills. We receive some assistance from the government however my unemployment is maxed out.  I do not want my ex husband to go under, regardless of the awful things he did, I want my children to have a nice home to call their own. Is it selfish of me to want that home to be with me and need assistance to give it to them?   I was laid off recently and am going to school for some training, slated to enter the work force in 03/15 and expect to once again earn an above poverty wage. Do I have a chance at getting some sort of help from him or is it likely he will gain custody?  Obviously I will need to see a lawyer in person about this but I'm looking for an idea of what to expect?\nTL;DR:"}

I know her favorite movie (Cast Away), that she's a great singer, etc. \n\nSaturday, he asked me what I thought of Cast Away. I immediately got kind of pissed and told him not to ask me about it. He asked why, and I gave him the cold shoulder. We talked about it and I explained it to him and how it connects to the girl and how it's still a sensitive subject. He told me that he didn't remember it was her favorite movie, and said sorry. \n\nI know it seems all worked out, but lately he's been getting weird with me again, ever since I got angry about the movie.

Against my better judgement, I went anyway. \nI walked in to the tanning salon, very weary of the environment. I put down all belongings and began undressing. Shoes, pants, then undergarments. My shirt hung over the important area that needed to be covered. As I unbuttoned my shirt, I noticed a shadow by the speaker in the upper corner. I looked up to see a camera with a red light. It moved almost robotically. It did not look like a hand was controlling it. My initial thought was a security camera. I knew that this was illegal so I grabbed my phone and called my mother. Still undressed. I looked up at the camera so whoever was watching would acknowledge the fact that i saw. I looked directly into the lens, and it moved down out of view. As I waited on her, I put my pants back on, and stepped outside to see if it was a tanning room or security room. The door was shut and it appeared to just be a storage room of some type. I went back to my room where I felt alone. My mom came to my room. She said there were no cameras. I argued with her to try to convince her that there was in fact a camera. We decided to leave and speak to the cashier. 30 seconds before we reached the cashier and asked, she said the guy next to me left because he \"received a phone call\". He got out quick. \n\nWe called the police after the incident but we haven't heard anything from the detective. Is this enough to get the guy in jail? Should I sue?

Normally I don't get pissed off that easily, but of you even lay a finger on my girlfriend, you will reget it!

We dated for a year and a half, this included many months of long distance while I was away at college. As a result of the distance, she felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention or affection, and to be honest, I wasn't. \n\nShe broke up with me in early July after this issue had been persisting for several months. It was probably the best choice even though neither of us really wanted to break up; it was just starting to become unhealthy. During the break up process, she says that she still cares about me and I'm her best friend and she wants to remain friends with me because we've shared so much during our time together that we shouldn't just cut each other off. I agree with all of this, despite the break up, I still care about her and love her (I think a part of me always will). I've never felt the same with anyone else as I did with her. \n\nSo fast forward a couple of weeks. I've kept communication to a minimum to try and let the pain ease a bit for both of us. Recently I've tried texting her and just trying to catch up and have conversations, but it seems like she isn't that interested in talking to me; she never texts me. I feel like she's stopped caring and that hurts because in our relationship, above all else, she was someone I could trust and confide in, a true friend. \n\nSo now I don't know what to do. Should I keep talking to her and wait for her to come around? Should I stop talking to her? I want to see her again (she goes to college near me) and hang out but I don't know how that would be received. My fear is that she's gotten to college and realized that she doesn't want me in her life, even as a friend.\nTL;DR:"}

She finished with her degree and decided to move to a town two hours away from the university we both went to. After trying long distance, I decided to transfer schools so that we would be able to live closer.\n\n Over the past few months my girlfriend has been bringing up our ages. At first it was pretty subtle, but it's gotten more and more direct. For instance, she'll talk about all her friends thinking it's crazy that she's dating someone so young, but now it's become these almost rants about how hard it is because all her friends are getting married and talking about having kids and how she doesn't want to be wasting her time. She'll actively get upset that I'm not ready to marry, and sometimes gets really down about it. However, our conversations always end with her saying she loves me and that she's willing to wait.\n\nI've been straight up with her, Reddit. I've said I'm not ok with marrying until I get out of undergrad, which is three more years out. I do see and would love to have a future with her. I want to marry her someday. I've told her that, even though it would be absolutely horrible, I would understand if she would want to find someone who can fulfill these needs and desires. She always says she's willing to wait. I just can't help feeling a bit insecure and worried because of how much she brings it up. I don't really know what else to say except what I have, and I think it has only gotten worse and only will get worse as she gets older. I don't want her to get bitter or resentful because she wants this life that her friends are living.\nTL;DR:"}

She hits him as hard as she can (which he plays off as a joke because she is so weak that she can't hurt anyone), and has made it to where he now reports his location to her. WE'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL. He can't hang out with me, and when she finds out that we do she gets super pissed. \n\nAnd it's not like she really cares about him-- she doesn't mind not seeing him, and when they're avoiding each other because he hates confrontation, she doesn't say a word to anyone, and I've no idea if she even talks to him about it. She even chooses not to sit by him in class. \n\nBut he doesn't believe that his relationship with her is unhealthy, and I'm just asking-- anyone have any advice for him? I'm hoping that maybe if it isn't coming from me then he'll take it seriously for once.\n\nAlso, note: our relationship is so platonic that my mother (who makes fun of me for even acknowledging a boy's presence) doesn't care if i have him over alone. At all. She's talked to him, quite likes him, and couldn't care less that we're friends because she knows it's platonic.\nTL;DR:"}

So I built my PC and was so excited to use a real computer and play games at higher than 15 FPS, I get windows started and everything is working and I have the case on its side so the Fan will stay somewhat in contact with the card. I had stated to a couple of friends of mine that the screws were wrong and that I was concerned that I maybe should wait for the screws to boot some games so i did and the next day I went to Home depot and looked for some screws and a Ethernet cable, unfortunately they couldn't find screws that fit so they told me to go tomorrow (Monday) to see if this store has the screws I need. Well I get home and start downloading stuff to my PC with the card as close to the fan part as possible so that is wont overheat or anything. I downloaded a game and I wanted to test the FPS to see what I get. I get into game with max setting 120 smooth and beautiful Master Race FPS and then black screen...My computer starts going fucking nuts, the fans are spinning like iam in a CAT 5 hurricane and I immediately turn it off thinking I just did something really wrong. I re check everything is correctly in sockets and reboot to see these fucking huge lines or artifacts things on my tv.  So I turn my PC off complete and re try the HDMI.

I had a million thoughts running trough my head and I thought it would be a good idea to put them down on paper and let her know what had been going through my head so I wrote down everything that I was thinking of. Ill include it in the comments if you care to read it.\n\nSo I called her and told her to come over after work because I had some things I wanted to tell her. She comes over later and I read the note to her and she took it so hard. She took it as reasons why not to date her when that was not my intention at all. I was simply stating things that were on my mind that needed clarification or things that I thought could be worked on. We didnt discuss a single thing because what I said upset her so much.\n\nThat was monday and to this day we have yet to fully talk about it because she doesnt want to and I really dont want to bring it up anymore because I feel like everytime I do it strains the relationship more. Right now I wish I wouldnt have said anything because it has really changed the dynamic of our relationship. She always seemed so happy befor this happened and would say how she missed me and she was very happy to be with me and that I made her heart race and gave her butterflies. Ever since that monday, she doesnt say I love you, she doesnt say she misses me anymore or anything she used to do\n\nI am very confused as to what to do because I just want things to go back to the way they were but I am unsure if they are going to. Any advice as far as what to do? I was thinking of taking a break maybe and not seeing each other as much but I really dont want to do that because I do love this woman and love very minute I get to be with her.\nTL;DR:"}

So we haven't been together for long, only about 6 months. Now my boyfriend is probably the most amazing sweet guy on the planet, though this can get annoying... He says I love you 5 times a day and constantly calls me beautiful. Sometimes this drives me nuts, I rather he show me that he loves me opposed to just tell me. I love how deep my boyfriend can get but he never does anything, always I have to talk to him first or ask to hang out because he has social anxiety and lots of issues. I'm always there for him but I like a guy who can take control who likes to touch me and hold me tight and my boyfriend isn't that kind of guy, which is alright I guess. \n\nBUT lately this guy I know started talking to me at first it was innocent but then it got more flirty and I was sure he was starting to hit on me. He then said what he wants to do with me how he wants to make-out and feel me up which made me uncomfortable but I went along with it. The problem is I cannot say no to guys. So essentially I was sexting this guy and he wants to meet up to hook up.\n\n He's so much more manly and he always makes the first move which is what I love in comparison to my boyfriend. But I love my boyfriend more than anything I love him so much it hurts thinking about us being apart.. I just don't know what to do with the other guys.. Have I already cheated on my boyfriend? How do you say no to guys?\nTL;DR:"}

We have good convos and click physically, though we haven't had sex yet (we've done other things to keep it fun though). However, I've noticed recently he has stopped putting maybe as much of an effort in as he did on our first dates. He'll usually just throw on a t-shirt for dates, not even really clean up his place before I come over. He seems attentive in every other way - we still go out on dates he pays for, he'll make me breakfast when i stay at his, be very affectionate - he just doesn't seem to care about being sloppy or messy in front of me at all. He even drank out of the orange juice carton in front of me today. I've never had a guy I'm dating do these kind of things, he's clearly super comfortable around me but is he too comfortable? Is this because he doesn't really care, or could it be he's just kind of a slob? I'm kind of perplexed by this behavior so early out of the gate.\nTL;DR:"}

I use to not talk too much to Beca as compared to the other girl-friends that she brings out to hang out and i wasnt very close to her either.\n\nI also used to have a personal emotional problem if opening myself up to others after dealing with a lost of an extremely close friend of the opposite gender due to an argument, that was about 3 years ago and Clara and my group of friends know about it as well.\n\nSoon this 2 group of friends went out on holidays together as groups of 4, consisting of Clara, Beca, Dan, and I. During the first trip overseas last year, I had numerous emotional attacks from the incident i mentioned before and it didnt help me in talking to Beca. \n\nAfter the trip, I went to consult a specialist and also researched on how to open myself to others.

Beca and I became the main planners of the trip.\n\nUnlike the past few times I met her, I became very close to her and I feel that I like her. However, when I mention close, I do not mean that we would share alot of things together or talk endlessly. I feel that I am drawn to her, we are able to work together well during the trip and I enjoy her company.\n\nMy other 2 friends(Clara and Dan) did notice about this \"closeness\" and asked if I liked her. I was shy and I just dodged the answer, but I think they soon notice it themselves and began to show signs of trying to match us together or start grinning to each other when we do something together (maybe it's me, but during the latter half of the trip, I notice that they would just \"pull back\" and let Beca and I walk in front).\nTL;DR:"}

We were friends for a while before that and other than a short break a year and a half ago, things have been great. We've been living together for nearly a year. We have similar tastes in books, music, movies, and television. We can have intelligent, thoughtful discussions. We've grown quite comfortable with each other. We can be totally ourselves and we generally really enjoy spending time together.\n\nDespite these things and despite realizing that I'm with a wonderful, genuinely good person who really cares about me, I'm very dissatisfied with our sex. Our sex drives and the frequency we want sex does align nicely, but we are simply not sexually compatible.\n\nOur sex is boring and tedious. She pretty much only enjoys being on top, riding me in a slow grind that doesn't stimulate me in the least. Sadly, I enjoy masturbating more than I enjoy having sex with her. She enjoys slow, intimate sex and is the least sexually adventurous person I've been with. She sees sex as an intimate act, something done out of love, more than an act for pleasure as I do. She's not comfortable with porn or anything that could be considered \"degrading.\"\n\nAs much as I like the thought of it, I don't think either of us would be comfortable with an open relationship. It's unfortunate because this is someone who I could see myself with indefinitely on an intellectual and emotional level, but I rarely desire her.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone has any suggestions.

After what happened to me, it's extremely difficult to not expect and assume the worst of others.

Then after 2 weeks i see she's in a relationship with a guy she was \"friends\" with. Aftetr having a meltdown and chatting with my peers, i found out she was lying and cheating on me with this guy. I felt so hurt, betrayed,  and angry. I was finally able to accept she didnt love me but this tears me apart even more. Ive decided on no contact and deleted all account and numbers of hers. Ive seen her twice since i found out this week and have been trying to avoid her. During one of our classes,  she asked to sit by me and i told her it would be better if she didnt. The second time she asked how i was doing and i said \"ok\" but obviously not wanting to talk with her. She knows something is up but not sure if she knows that i know shes cheated. Im not sure if i should just tell her to stay away from me or just talk with her and tell her i know she cheated and how i feel. Im definitely not looking to get back together. Part of me wants to tell her off but i know that will just make things worse. So should i have a final talk with her or just tell her to leave me alone?\nTL;DR:"}

We'd text every other day or, and meet up once a week, had some idle plans about future get-togethers (he have slept together a few times). I went out of town for a weekend (told her) and ended up not contacting her for about four days, being busy doing stuff with the family. After the weekend was up, she sent me an email that kind of surprised me, asking why I was breaking up with her and how I could suddenly give her the cold shoulder. Being shocked, I responded that she might be more attached than I am and that maybe it would be better to tone things down or break them off completely.\n\nTo my surprise, she went on to explain that she had received some bad advice from her friends and, coupled with her previous history, had come to the conclusion that I was breaking up with her. Acting on that assumption, she had written the (as she describes) uncharacteristically heavy email. I, meanwhile, had asked my friends for advice and they had almost unanimously agreed that she was in love with me already after way to short a period and encouraged me to end things.\n\nThe problem now is that we haven't seen each other for a week, and things seem really awkward in the less-than-optimal ways we *are* communicating (mostly text and email). I have a sinking suspicion that the whole thing was small misunderstanding that was blown out of proportion by bad advice from our respective friends. But I don't know how to talk about that kind of stuff and other relationship questions without seemingly going back on \"my request\" to keep things casual.\n\nAre things too awkward now to attempt to repair them? Would it be better now to just cut our losses and just go our separate ways?\nTL;DR:"}

In my dream there was a relative of mine who had their left hand cut off in an accident but luckily they got their hands connected back to them. \nWhen I asked them what happened, they also tell me that they had to cut off their feet too and other hand because somehow the blood pressure from their cut off left hand was affecting the way they walked and kept them from getting to safety. That's not all. \n\nAfter their limbs were back I was shocked and scared at what had happened. Later on in the dream, at their job, that left hand started coming off again for some reason and they went to go do something out of my sight to reattach it. I had panicked and called 911 but somehow there was a menu option and when I finally got to the operator all I did was say the address and told them that someone's hand was cut off. The 911 operator said something about the correct way to report an emergency and then the call was disconnected. \n\nWhile I waited at the workplace for the person to return, a group of four men came in and asked me to lower the music from that place. I showed them where they could lower the music and they went. Then I noticed an uzi machine gun on one of the guys and I called the person who had the hand problem. Meanwhile the person pointed the Uzi at my chest and told me the name of the person whom they wanted to \"talk\" to. While on the phone I tried to think of a way to warn that person while at the same time trying to think of a way to get out of the situation.\n\nMy heart started beating so fast that it woke me up from the dream at that moment.\nTL;DR:"}

Her dream has always been UCSF, literally one of the best med schools in the country. She got invited to interview, and shortly after found out she was on the waitlist. As of 3 weeks ago she had about 6 acceptances (which is ridiculously amazing), and we were planning on going to USC. She found out she got in at UCLA, which would be a much cheaper option and a MUCH more prestigious school. We were super excited and signed a lease for a beautiful apartment on the west side, signed a lease, and bought a new bed. \n\nNow of course, 4 days ago she found out she got into UCSF off the wait list. A huge part of her wants to ditch out on LA and move up to SF, but she doesn't want me to resent giving up all my work and connections and friends down here. She wants to go on an adventure while we still can, before we have kids and stuff. Part of me wants to support her in this endeavor and move up but at this point it would be a huge ordeal. Breaking a lease, finding a new apt in San Fran at the last minute (we are insanely busy through the first week of August and couldn't start looking until then), probably burning through all of my savings doing so.\n\nIs it worth it to pursue this dream? I feel like I would be giving up a lot in LA, but what's wrong with a little adventure? Is moving away from all of our family and friends (support system) during an extremely stressful time stupid? \n\nThere are so many potential regrets either way and we are paralyzed by this decision. I'm afraid of holding her back, and she's afraid of holding me back. The financial difference at the end of school could easily be over $100,000 in loans, about a 40% increase. She doesn't know I'm posting this here...\nTL;DR:"}

Just a little background: the health room used to be used for cooking, so it still has stoves and such in it. Also, my school runs on a day + block schedule, and today happened to be a day where I had health right after French.\n\nSo today in French we were celebrating La Chandeleur by making crepes, and therefore we were using the health room. The health classes were sent to the French classroom, of course. After French I wasn't really thinking, so I was thinking that I would head to my final class (Art) now because I just left \"health\" (which I would have right after French normally) so I walked into the room, and I was walking around, getting all set up. One thing was wrong here: nobody was showing up. I was confused, so I mentioned to the art teacher, \"It seems like everybody fell off the face of the earth.\" He then asked me if I had study hall, which I replied no. He then said, \"It's F block.\" It hit me - I was supposed to be in Health, not Art. I quickly gathered my things and went to the French room (luckily, the Art room is right next to the stairs and the French room is right at the stairs). I felt like a moron the rest of the day.

How it was to be single again. The idea of meeting new girls. Experiencing things on my own. Travelling alone. I was never content with having a partner that I could experience my life with, even though she loved me to death. It's really confusing because she was a great person. I would push her away during the times when she would attempt to get close, ie. talked about marriage, having kids, travelling together, etc. I could see myself having a great life with her, but I was afraid of commitment. Is it due to my age or is it something I need to learn about myself? Is this a classic case of \"the grass is not really greener on the other side\"?\n\nFor whatever reasons now, we are broken up, but I want to understand why I could not fully open up and commit myself to this girl. There was nothing wrong with her. She was fully committed to me. Now that we are broken up, I regret not opening up to her, not accepting her love and commitment.

The back yard anxiety/phobia is still there, but they are much more willing with some encouragement to go potty outside now. 2) I time their potty breaks carefully - a pee break first thing waking up, poop breaks about 10 minutes after each meal, a pee break when I get home from work and before bed along with various other breaks throughout the day. For the most part I was doing this before, but now I stay outside with them to make sure they do their business. 3) I walk those suckers every damn night after dinner - they are particularly reluctant to poop in the yard at night but love walks so we go on our 20-30 min poopie walk every night.

(My only worry with this option is it's quite difficult to find any local jobs in admin/helpdesk work and I don't feel qualified at all for even the lowest tier of IT positions).\n\nI'm going through local software companies and emailing them about the prospect of getting some work experience days at a few them. My course has a mandatory summer work experience between 3rd and 4th year but I thought it'd be good for me and my CV to get some before looking for internships. \n\nPlus over the next few months, I've made a detailed list of goals and aims when it comes to coding and that to try and build a little portfolio of programs. Also, I've booked an appointment at my universities careers centre to discuss my CV and gain their insight.\nTL;DR:"}

I noticed that a phone number was listed, so I called, introduced myself, and made sure she was available to accept it because I didn't want to drive all the way across town to find that she wasn't home. She seemed pretty cool about it, she said she was home and didn't plan on going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nSo I pull into her driveway (nice house, by the way, single-story, no pool, but still a nice looking house) and get out of the car with my clipboard and paperwork in hand. I walk to her doorstep and ring the doorbell. Almost immediately, I hear her say \"Just a minute, I'm coming.\" so I give her a minute to come and open the door. She was in her mid-50s and in a wheelchair. She says \"Hello, officer, you have some paperwork for me?\". I say \"Yep, right here.\" and gesture towards my clipboard. Before letting me utter another word (but without being snotty about it), she says \"What type of paperwork might it be?\". I flip through a few pages and say \"It looks like it's divorce paperwork\", to which she let out a disappointing \"Oh\". I said \"Oh, so you weren't expecting this?\". She said \"No, not really\", so I did the sensible thing and said \"Oh, well, I'm sorry for your loss.\" I have her sign, then I go to fill in the date.\n\n**2/14**\n\nIt was fucking *Valentine's day*.\nTL;DR:"}

That didn't work out, have been on a few dates here and there, but haven't had anything to speak of in several years.\n\nMet new guy, we're coming from very similar backgrounds; have been getting to know each other slowly via text for a few months, he asked me several times about getting together for dinner and we just kept having schedule conflicts.  Finally had dinner followed by coffee, and hit it off really well.  Date (he referred to it as a date so there's no miscommunication there) lasted 3.5 hours, only ended when it did because starbucks was closing lol.  We just hit it off amazingly well.  End of the night came, I realized he might kiss me, got scared and kind of gave him a big hug and ran off like a flustered 15 year old :(.  I think he knew I was just nervous vs not interested, just what I perceived.\n\nWe have plans to go to a movie in a few days.  I'm not really the 'take the lead' type, but I'd almost rather just take the reigns so that I know when it's coming and I don't freak out and ruin my own chances.  Or ruin my chances by doing nothing and coming off as uninterested.  Was thinking something super conservative like initiating a kiss on the cheek.....I wanted to somehow make it clear that although we are both very shy and conservative, that it's just nervousness vs non-interest.  If I weren't interested I wouldn't be kissing even his cheek.  I wouldn't be going out to dinner with the guy and wasting both our times.  Also throw in the mix that I think some guys might not like the woman to be the initiator and I don't know this guy well enough to know his stance on that yet.  Anyway, looking for a clear but gradual way to break the physical barrier.  So here I am turning to the internet for advice.  Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: I caught my boss adding extra hours to her time sheet and need advice\nPOST: I am in charge of checking payroll where I work, and I see how many hours people work during the pay period (2 weeks). We've had a lighter month than usual, and a few people were commenting that they didn't work as much because of it. What should have been 80 hours, was more like 70-75. One person barely broke 60. \n\nI noticed my boss had 80+ hours, even though She took two half-days during this pay period. She over compensated her paid time off (PTO). She added time to her half-days so that she had close to 10 hours for each of her days off, even though she didn't put in more than 8 hours a day at work this whole month (she worked closer to 7 hrs a day). She is constantly complaining about the budget and complains when we (the employees) need supplies (you know, for our jobs). I feel like she's cheating the company by taking extra time off she didn't earn, and even getting some over time when she's pretty much the only one (there is a specialist who has the most work out of everyone regardless). I'm not mad she took PTO, I'm mad because she intentionally set it for more than 8 hours to boost her paycheck. \n\nThe problem is, I can't do anything about it. I have a very low position and I hold no sway. I can't tell the higher ups in the company/corporation, because she's in good with all of them and it will just come back to bite me. I can't tell the other employees because that will just start more drama and tension in the office. I'm also not entirely sure if what she did was unethical in taking advantage of the situation, or if anything wrong actually took place. \n\nSo, is this unethical or illegal, or am I just not used to office politics?\nTL;DR:"}

Ever since I graduated from high school I have noticed this giant problem. My younger brother keeps stealing and breaking items that belong to my family. Within this week he has stolen/broken one thing from each person of the household,excluding the dog.\n\nHe stole of my stuff,like my playing cards,and I have been finding them strewn around the house. He broke my mother's sewing machine and now she has to go all over town finding the parts that are missing. He broke all of the flashlights and and messed up some of my father's tools. I have to take things with me,hide them thoroughly,or leave them at someone's house to insure that they are left alone.\n\nHe has no money to pay for it,lies about when he does mess things up,doesn't show remorse and everyone's given up on punishing him since it never gets better,and nothing works. When I complain about it,or try to do something,my mom mentions his ADHD,and how his mind is different. I get that,and he's taking medicine,but that doesn't mean we should just let these things slide. I'm about to move out,partially because of this situation,but I worry about what will happen in the future because of his behavior. My other brother [16] doesn't want to deal with him at all,and I kinda don't really feel like talking to him either because of this. Right now he is only wrecking our stuff,but I don't want to see if things get worse...\nTL;DR:"}

This may be a bit scrambled, I'm upset and not sure if I'm being selfish or not.\n\nBit of background, I've know B for a year and half, met through a dating site, started as friends and then kinda bounced between dating and not dating. We didn't see each other often, maybe every other weekend, which was ok at first. I started to push for more, and B backed off. He then told me that he didn't mean to back off, but due to some health issues he was anxious and nervous about dating, and didn't want to lead me on. One of the health issues is being tired a lot, which can be a struggle for him to go out.\n\nThrough out our whole relationship, B has bailed on me time and time again. I was sympathetic for a while, I understood that if you have no energy you literally can't go anyway, but every single time I will get my hopes up, only to have them dashed, and I feel like shit.\n\nB doesn't mean to do this, he apologises every time, and feels fairly shit himself. But I can't keep doing this. I want to have a relationship with him, I want to see him, but the fact that whatever we arrange to do fails is crushing me. I hate it.\n\nI know I need to tell him how I feel, but I'm terrified to do so. His health is so shitty that me telling him this will just add to him feeling worse. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose him as a friend, or at all, but I want to be in a relationship that's going somewhere, and one where I can actually see my partner. And honestly I just want him.\n\nThe straw that finally broke the camels back was yesterday,  he was meant to come to mine, but cancelled as he was exhausted. OK, that's fine, except that what is the difference between chilling at mine and chilling at home, when he would be doing exactly the same thing in both places.\n\nI'm burnt out I guess, my frustration with this is getting to the point where I will explode and say something I don't mean. I just feel disappointed and rejected.\nTL;DR:"}

He got mad when I told him I didn't appreciate it.\nPOST: This is our first party together with ppl he works with at a restaurant. I'm talking to someone standing to the side of where he is talking to this girl he works with. All I catch is him two-arm hugging her around her neck and her saying, \"ooh, a kiss on the head? It's ok, I won't tell!\" (She just met me as his gf half an hour earlier.) And then she leaves. Neither of them knew that I heard. \n\nI know this was harmless. He probably flirts with her at work and it's all probably very harmless. However, I know that if the tables were turned, he would be angry (stonewalling me and totally withholding of affection). I just feel that it was inappropriate for that girl to say that and that it was disrespectful of him to two-arm hug someone he works with and kiss her on the head.\n\nI very calmly (I was sober) asked how he would feel if I did the same thing. I stated that I wasn't mad at him, that I just didn't appreciate his behavior. I feel like it communicates to others that he can have his cake and eat it too. Like \"sure, he's got a gf at home, but he secretly wants in these other girls pants\".\n\nHe was mad at me for bringing it up. Said that jealousy didn't look good on me and that he was mine and no one else's blah blah blah. I'm not scared that he's going to leave me for her. It definitely brings back bad memories of my exes that had crushes messed around with ppl from work, but mostly I feel like it just makes me look bad. Like a sucker. \nAt this point, I don't know whether to hang on to my pride (like I know he would if he were in my shoes), or to be the bigger person and let it go. Do I have a right to feel uncomfortable about that? Don't I deserve consideration in the future and a heartfelt apology? Some perspective would be nice.\nTL;DR:"}

This group of friends has parties often and I am never invited to any of them. They all come to school on Monday and I sit down with them and listen to them talk about this awesome, super fun party they had. Then after the next period, I get to listen to them plan the next party. Right in front of me. And I never get invited. They never even acknowledge that I am there when they are planning. This irritates me, but I wouldn't really want to go anyway since most of them are fucking annoying when drunk(like most people), but it would still be nice to be thought of. I know these people aren't my true friends and I would never trust them with anything. \n\nMy imaginary friends aren't the people I hang out with. They are other people in the school that I have had classes with, or that I know from public school. They just live with me at my house and we just chill. \n\nNone of my friends, not even my best friends know about this. This is probably the only secret I have and I am trusting it to you reddit.

And the only times he has texted me was when he was horny, which has been most days.

He texted me last night saying he was horny, but he figured I would be asleep so he sorted himself out right before I texted back. We found it funny and I asked how his day was, no reply, no biggie cus I figured he had gone to sleep, so I said good night.\n\nHe didn't reply today, I'm not too bothered but the thing that is bothering me is that he said he wanted to chat with me.

We are both studying design which is a very demanding career. We have been together for a year and a half now and have been in the same classes for the most part. It has happened before and it's been bothering me for a while but people (including me) can't help but compare us, and most of the time, choose him over me. \n\nHe's always been great with people, he's kind and funny and great at making friends. I'm shy and have trouble getting to know new people. Girls always fall for him because of his helpful and friendly personality and still happens. When we sketch, friends compliment him on his drawing skills and even though I've been working hard on improving I never seem to be as great as him. We study together and when something turns hard we both grow stressed and sad but I seem to be the one comforting him even though he ends up doing better than me. Teacher's all know his name and they have trouble remembering mine. \n\nI've talked to him about it and he always tells me to stop being so pessimistic about my work and that I'm always very negative. Other times he tells me that it's just how he is. Some times he just tells me I'm great even though he never tells me how. Some times he gets angry and stops listening. \n\nI've never been insecure, I mean, not overly insecure but the regular amount. I'm the kind of person that strives to be as good as I can be at what I do. I've always gotten good grades but recently I seem to be lagging behind. We are always together and people seem to notice only him. I've been doing my best to ignore it but its not all in my mind.
