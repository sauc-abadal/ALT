It always ends poorly.\nPOST: We've only been together a few months, so I know we're still in the ironing-out phase if you will. \n \nAnd if this comes out as our biggest problem, then I think we're ok, but it is something we just can't seem to find common ground on.\n \nShe's in college and still kind of adjusting to everything. As a young college student, parties tend to be *the* place to go.\n \nI, being the older one, have been there and done that. I know what happens when you throw college guys, college girls, drugs and alcohol all in the same room. \n \nAnd each time, I try to remind her that last time didn't go over too well, and she just brushes it off and basically says I don't know what I'm talking about. \n \nSo long story short, after last night, she's been to 1 party where something bad didn't happen. Last night was not that night.\n \nI, being straightedge, am completely against drugs/alcohol. She tells me last night shes already put down a bunch of drinks and burned herself getting high. Oh and some guy borderline sexually assaulted her. So now, she's doing things that I absolutely refuse to include in my life, and other guys are feeling up my girlfriend. I'm hours away from her campus and completely helpless in these situations. The only thing I can do is trust her, and hope for the best.\n \nBut this is getting old. This isn't the first time she's gotten drunk. Or smoked. Or been groped.\n \nAnd I know I probably sound like an overpowering boyfriend, but I'm really not! I want her to have fun! I want her to enjoy college and get some experience out of life. It's just really hard when she's far away, getting into trouble, and all I can do is sit back and say, \"I told you so. Are you ok?\"\n \nI just don't know what to do or say. I want her to have fun in life and for her to get the \"full\" experience out of college, but this is getting hard for me.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: What is an appropriate response to my (25F) SO's (25M) family issues?\nPOST: So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 2 years. Our relationship on the whole is great. Lately he's been having some family trouble and I'd like some objective opinions on what I can do to help.\n\n5 weeks ago, he found out his parents are getting a divorce. This is not a huge surprise (they have told him they are getting a divorce several times before, but it looked like they had gotten past that). He has been in close contact with his Dad, but he has only spoken to his mother twice since he found out. One of the times he spoke to his mother it was just because he needed to pick up some stuff from her house as they are selling it because of the divorce. He blames her for it and will not talk to her or either of his half siblings, who he thinks helped convince her to get the divorce.\n\nSo three weeks ago, he found out his maternal grandmother has cancer.  He is afraid to go over there because he might have to see his mother or talk about the divorce.\n\nTwo weeks ago his niece was born. He has not gone to see her, as he has not talked to his half siblings since he found out about the divorce and does not want it brought up.\n\nI don't know what to do here to help him. We have agreed that these are not issues that will magically go away, and he needs to talk to his family and definitely a counselor about these issues. He says he doesn't have time to talk to anyone about this, not me, not a counselor, not his family. He is refusing to speak with his family about MAJOR life events. I feel like this is completely inappropriate. At a minimum I would like to get his Grandmother a card and some flowers to show sympathy for her cancer and offer our help, and I would like to get his SIL something to congratulate her on the baby. He does not want contact with any of his family for the reasons above and will not give me their contact info to at least acknowledge the situation.\nTL;DR:"}

Any advice is welcomed!\nPOST: Hi /r/loseit, I have somehow found myself the sole active moderator over at /r/XboxFitness , and I need some advice in crafting a routine for what has swelled to over 150 people! (When I started it was like 30 people, now that the membership is large... I want to get it right).\n\nThe single most requested feature was a \"schedule\" (I had simply been posting my workouts for others to follow or not). So I started planning my weeks videos out...\n\n**What is Xbox Fitness?**\n\nXbox Fitness is an app on xbox that \"Game-ifies\" various exercise DVDs with the Kinect camera, giving users points for reps, holding their form, etc. etc.\n\n**What the community has done**\n\nIn January we started a \"January with Jillian Michaels\" program. We started with \"Ripped in 30\" on MWF and \"Extreme Shed and Shred\" on TuTh(Sa). Some people even added Kickboxing to MWF to get an hour's worth of fitness in. These tapes (ooh, dating myself), are all cross training. That is, they all have some weight training, cardio, and bodyweight fitness, and some abs.\n\n**The Problem with February**\n\nThis is where Im seeking advice. The members of /r/XboxFitness have expressed interest in using the MOSSA selections for February. MOSSA divides cardio from weightlifting from abs into 3 separate 30 min routines. The MOSSA selections are\n\n* Core 1 30min\n\n* Core 2 30min\n\n* Fight 1 30min\n\n* Fight 2 30min\n\n* Groove 1 30min\n\n* Power 1 30min\n\n* Power 2 30min\n\nWould there be a significant advantage to dividing the days by type (ie MWF = 2x fight videos for an hour of cardio & TuThSa 2x Power videos for an hour of lifting)? Or for this kind of exercise, would it be better to mix a power and fight video each day? How often would you recommend the 30 min abs? Would it be better to have shorter power or cardio when adding an abs video?\nTL;DR:"}

I know this is my problem and it's something I want to fix. \n\nFor example, my girlfriend has a pretty busy schedule. (We are both in college) \nShe works 3 times a week, volunteers at a hospital once a week, and just has things to do otherwise. Today I asked her to hangout and she said she couldn't. She had plans to do some other things today. (Not being specific because it doesn't matter) that made me mad for some reason. I wish it didn't, but it did. I feel like if she asked me to hangout, I would say yes and work around whatever I have to do. \n\nWe are only able to hangout once or twice a week, and we see each other for a little bit every morning before our classes. \n\nRecently I've found my self over thinking more and more and I don't want it to affect our relationship. I feel like I have some sort of insecurity with her. I feel like I always expect her to be super happy to see me and when she's not, I wonder what's wrong or what I could have done. I start to over think it and analyze everything that happens until I'm sure she's okay or whatever. \n\nThis isn't normal behavior of me and it's really making me upset. I really like this girl and I don't want to hurt our relationship. I know this is my problem and I would like to handle it. \n\nOn a side note, she did tell me that she doesn't like to share her feelings. This didn't bother me at first but I wish she would more so I wouldn't have to over think if she cares or not. \n\nHelp? I'm confused and could really use some nice and helpful advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I love going out to bars, movies, whatever I find fun. I am slightly overweight (I weigh 250, but I've got quite a bit of muscle in addition to just being a big person overall, and I started working out again to get rid of some excess), but I wouldn't call myself fat.\n\nI don't really have any trouble talking to girls once I get the conversation going, but that's just my problem. I used to be a lot fatter than I am, and during my high school years I never went out. And that's not an exaggeration, the only times I went out with anyone other than family members during my high school years was for football practice/games or to work. It wasn't until the senior year after football season ended that I got a job as a server that has really helped open me up by forcing me to learn how to talk to people. That's what really got me to leave my house.\n\nI have had one girlfriend in the past. She was incredibly beautiful and incredibly nice, but we didn't work out and I am ready to put myself back on the market. I initially thought that I could try some of the same moves I used on her, until I realized that I got to talking with her by giving one of her friends that I worked with my phone number to give to her. Even the one girl I got to go out with me I got in the most socially awkward way possible.\n\nWhere I'm going with this is, I do not know how to approach a girl and get her to start talking to me. I still think of myself as that extremely fat (315 at one point) guy who never did much during his teens so never developed any social skills. I just assume that any girl will see this right away, laugh, and move on. How does one get over this fear?\nTL;DR:"}

She has been seeing a therapist about depression and just started taking an anti-depressant (which I know could be contributing to this problem) I woke up this morning with a voice mail from her stating she was in the hospital because her depression grew worse and that she would have no access to phones/computers for a bit. \n\nNow I do know from experience she will be able to call me if she chooses at a later point; and I was able to talk to her briefly this morning and ensured her I loved her/cared and acted as calm as possible and as reassuring as possible.

I started dating my girlfriend while in high school and she knows that I do not get along with my parents.\n\nI ended up going to school for 2 years before I decided that I didn't want to be a doctor anymore and I dropped out.

They have no idea where I am or what I am doing with my life.\n\nSo since I moved out I proposed to my girlfriend last fall and we are getting married this summer, we are planning the invites and my soon to be wife told me I need to send my parents an invite because they are family and should be included in this event. I explained to her that the last time I talked to them was the last time I was ever going to talk to them and how it would make me uncomfortable to ask them to show up.\n\nShe told me family is important and it would hurt her to know my parents would never be able to witness the event.

Can you have your cake and eat it too??\nPOST: My boyfriend (we'll call him Andrew) and I have been together for over 8 months now, and have been very good about talking through things that have come up in our relationship thus far. Most recently, he says that his thoughts about a sexual encounter with another man have been lingering in the back of his mind.\n\nQuick backstory: Andrew had a very brief encounter with a man in San Francisco that entailed him giving said man a blowjob; more was offered but nothing happened beyond that, and this was before we were together.\n\nBefore he met me, he started peeling back layers of his sexuality, from pegging (woman penetrating the man with a strap-on), the SF incident, transsexual porn, gay porn, even casually pursuing men on OKCupid. \n\nThis is all fine by me, as we are in a loving and committed long-term relationship and I only want him to be happy, which involves being true to yourself and your wants/needs. However, one night his wanting to try being sexual with a man was brought up and it made me very emotional. On the one hand, I want him to find out what his preferences are while we're still young, but on the other hand, the thought of him having sex with a man, shit anyone else really, makes me so extremely uncomfortable.\n\nI am afraid that I am wired for monogamy, which is frustrating because I do not want him to resent me for not exploring that side of his sexuality, and I also do not want to resent him for feeling pressured to open our relationship so that he can explore that side of his sexuality. I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I would like to solve this sooner rather than later. He also feels that he has a preference for monogamy, and says that he would not want to do anything that would jeopardize our relationship and that he loves me very much.\nTL;DR:"}

Forget her name, but this isn't about her. \n\nHe recently posted a picture of his modified off road truck, and a lady liked it. I naturally looked at her profile. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, but my partner has liked every picture of her and even commented on some like \"epic\", \"nice\", \"wow\". She's dyed her hair bright red too. it's kinda brought me down because she would always reply all blushed up and embarrassed. ( ugh )  he'd just like her comment, but in the response from her she would always say; \"Awh, thanks Morgy!! *kiss kiss* ;D \" \n\nUgh. So I don't know if I'm being insecure, but she just sounds..flirty. and it brings me down. We are both our firsts.\nTL;DR:"}

In the machine room there was a system terminal with special privileges which we used for kicking off backups and so on. We got word that a user terminal was 'stuck' and needed to be disconnected. Not something I'd had to do before but hey, how hard can it be? Apparently there's a command ('TCALL') for doing just that. So I type in TCALL and press enter, thinking it will show me the options for specifying which terminal etc. In fact, it disconnected every single terminal from the system, and it took two days to get them all connected again. Cost was estimated in the hundreds of thousands. And that's how I earned the nickname 'The TCALL Kid' and no respect from any of my coworkers.\n\nFrom the [GCOS manual](\n\n*TCALL - A GCOS system command entered at system console by operator to terminate interactive processing by users currently on system.\nTL;DR:"}

As a person, she's great, very friendly and very helpful. However, every time I'm asked to put together a piece of work, she ends up revamping essentially the entire thing, and it's really starting to irritate me. I'd like to think of this as  a learning opportunity to better understand how things work around here, but I must admit, as patient and understanding a person I believe myself to be, I'm getting pretty close to just asking her flat out if she thinks my workmanship sucks (more diplomatically than that of course). \n\nFor some context, the team here has been small for a few years with minimal external additions. She has started \"from the bottom\" and earned her stripes, I suppose, to get to where she is. I can appreciate that, but if she's transitioning to a management role (which I suspect she is trying to do eventually), I feel she will inevitably become the micromanaging type. Maybe this isn't worth fretting over, but I also don't want to be seen as incompetent.\nTL;DR:"}

As you can imagine, it is extremely painful and has severely impacted her quality of life. It hurts to move, walk, etc. and has been terrible for the last few months. Her back doctor recommended a procedure called a discectomy which is kind of like surgery, but not as invasive (it's only a 4 day recovery process).\n\nThe doctor had about two or three conference calls with the my fiancee's insurance company, emblem, and they told us in January that it was approved. We heard that it was approved from both the doctor and the insurance company. A week later we booked the appointment for the procedure which was scheduled to take place tomorrow.\n\nYesterday, my fiancee gets a call from the doctor who said that the insurance company is now saying that they don't approve the procedure after all. This was after they mentioned they approved it on two separate occasions. What's odd too is that the insurance company said they'd approve it, but with anesthesia (meaning they had a clause in place already for this type of procedure) and now all of a sudden, two days before the procedure they say \"no sorry, we're not approving it after all\".\n\nSince the procedure didn't happen and they just simply canceled it, there's nothing we can do right? We are just so angry, frustrated, and helpless. This was the light at the end of a painful tunnel and now it's gone.\nTL;DR:"}

How long should I save and what can I expect?\nPOST: I am looking for some advice and knowledge on what the cost of living is like for young people on their own. I'm going to turn 24 and have been looking for a job out of college for quite some time now. Obviously I am tired of living at home and would like to move out someday. However, I don't plan on moving out once I get that job, since I would like be somewhat more financially stable.\n\nFirst here is some info about myself that would help. I turn 24 this week, and graduation in January with a degree in mechanical engineering. My parents helped me a lot with student loans. I have to pay like 40k myself about. I live in southern NJ and would like to move to Philly at some point.\n\nSo what can I expect for when I move out? Obviously I would have to pay for rent, utilities, food, phone bill, car insurance, transportation, clothing, entertainment, and start paying off my student loans. I feel like money will be gone very quickly. I am wondering how tough it can be and what I could do to be financially better off when I get to this point.\n\nAlso, how long should I save for? After I get my job I was planning on living at home for 1-2 years to save up as much money as I can. That way I can take a big chunk out of my student loans and then be much better off. My mother thinks I need to live at home for longer. She tried to explain that it's not easy living on your own, which I do completely believe, but I don't think I have to live home and save until i'm 28 to move out.\nTL;DR:"}

I say that he's considered the hotter/cuter one because numerous people have mentioned that I \"did well\", and some of my friends have complimented me on how attractive he is. He has a reputation for being the \"hot RA\" where he works on campus at our school.

The first time a boy ever told me he liked me (freshman year of high school), I quite literally burst into tears because I was happy yet could hardly believe it was possible. Sometimes I look at my boyfriend and ask myself, \"How in the world did I manage to catch this piece of delicious man meat???\" He of course is the sweetest guy ever and always comments on how beautiful and cute I am, etc. But no matter how happy he makes me, there is that underlying feeling of insecurity because I can't help being paranoid about what other people think; i.e. \"How did HE end up with HER?\" As well as the fear of him waking up one day and suddenly realizing that maybe I'm not so great of a catch, because he technically could get a hotter girl. \n\nI don't want to seem like I'm whining, but it is an underlying fear of mine, as if this happiness that I feel in finally being with someone who feels the same way towards me can only be fake--because I don't deserve it, because I'm not pretty enough.

I've considered trying to make small talk with her, but I don't want to make things uncomfortable if the conversation feels forced (and every topic I've thought of feels forced).

And it may also influence my parents into not going also.\n\nThe whole situation has upset me a great deal and though I've not spoken to anyone from my mothers side of the family yet, I know it is going to upset them, especially the uncle who is getting married (he lives in New York and his fiancee is Swedish, so a lot of people are travelling a long way for this to be held in Ireland).\n\nI will still be attending but I need to convince my parents that it will be ok for them to attend.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (28M) don't know what to do for my step-dad on Father's Day\nPOST: A little background: I grew up with my step-dad and my biological mom, who together had 2 other sons. My bio-dad was out of the picture for almost my entire life, minus my first 3 years and only precariously since 2010. Growing up, my step-dad was kind of an asshole to me, always favoring his true sons, taking out his anger on me (rarely physically and if so, nothing crazy), putting me down (calling me worthless, a piece of shit, etc.), and being completely unavailable to me, emotionally. He did his best to support me financially and to push me in school and athletics, but for the longest time, I carried around a chip on my shoulder about the way he treated me and resented him for a while about it, but in the last few years, after a lot of counseling, I've begun to let things go. He held a job stocking frozen pizzas at grocery stores for almost 30 years, which I'm sure he hated, which is surely a reason why he had so much anger to vent. Our relationship still isn't great, i.e. i still don't send him gifts or call him up to shot the breeze, but it's not the tense, avoidant relationship it once was. At best, it's cordial and we can share a laugh together when I see him and the family on the one time or less a year that I see them. \n\nNow that it's almost Father's Day, I am struggling still on how to proceed with him. He lives in Illinois and I in Colorado, so hanging out isn't really an option, and I still feel like sending a gift is almost a betrayal to my own past and the pain that came from the way he treated me; it's all a bit complicated. \n\nThe bio-dad sitch is a little more straightforward; our relationship is so tenuous that I may not even email him, but as I haven't given him an update in quite a while, now might be a good time to do it. \n\nAny suggestions around this fatherly conundrum?\nTL;DR:"}

All of the rooms at my university were PACKED except one room at the top floor of our union. Looked inside, was just a basic classroom, go figure. So after about 2 hours of studying, and nobody coming in the room, we decided to take a break before switching subjects. We decided to watch a couple Cyanide and Happiness videos to spend our break. We watched a couple down the list and as we got halfway through [this video] a girl comes into the room and walks behind some divider. We were planning on just finishing the video and then go back to study so we could all be quiet and study in peace. Then in the video the guy flips a cross upside down, kills a goat, and the worst part HAIL SATAN and the volume was pretty close to maxed out for whatever reason. So we finish the video completely and study for another minute or two and the girl just ups and leaves.  \nSo studying goes on and some guy comes in to join us. There are about 10 chairs available and this dude sits on the floor. He makes sure he's pointing in the right direction and bows his head. After a few moments he leaves. Now we think something is up. We go outside the door and there's an unfortunately placed note that says it's a prayer room. So yeah that girl prayed for a couple minutes right after hearing HAIL SATAN and people happily talking to a cartoon Satan character. Anyways goodluck on finals guys!\nTL;DR:"}

We live in the same country about an hour and half by plane.\n\nI'm moving to study in the UK though, which is 6 hours away. 2 hours time difference.\n\nI know alot of people would think what's the difference? We live in a sort of kind of a conservative country, so when I go to him I have to come up with any excuse though it's not required but just to not be suspicious. When he visits me we usually just hang out because I don't have options for us to get comfortable where I live.\n\nHowever, we're both established and financially independent so we travel wherever we want and every 3-4 months we go somewhere abroad.\n\nWe agreed that when I'm in London things will actually be easier because he'll have a reason to go there more often (he already goes there at least twice a year) so now he'll make that even more. And he will look for a summer course from his work. We also agreed that because I'll be busier than usual, if we don't text/talk everyday it's ok and the other person shouldn't feel left out or worried. And we would Skype more as we rarely do video chatting. He's also a busy man! So he won't necessarily feel left out.\n\nI'm so confused, I'm 100% sure that I don't have any doubts about wanting to put all my effort for this relationship. He's an amazing kind person. But I also don't want to make myself and him feel like it's easier than what it really is.\n\nDo you guys think I'm exaggerating?\nTL;DR:"}

My parents know she's a deadbeat but they bail her out of trouble a lot anyway.\n\nMy sister has lunch plans with my mom next week and she wants to tell her then.

We're all very unsure of what his reaction will be but we're all certain it won't be a positive one.\n\nAnother snag is that my sister's boyfriend's mom doesn't like my sister because bf's mom attached to bf's ex-girlfriend and has hinted at an abortion but it's kinda too late for that.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Am I [18f] being manipulated in my relationship with my boyfriend[19m]?\nPOST: So, I'm in a very happy relationship with my boyfriend of going on 6 months (Good friends with for over a year). We have disagreements but don't fight, but one disagreement I was a bit meh with and told my girl friends about. I would very much love to get nipple piercings, tongue split, genital piercings, etc. but he just is not into it at all and said I shouldn't. Ok fair enough. \nNow, I'm also very happy to cook for him whenever he comes over and I'm more than happy to bake cakes and other sweets for him to bring to him about every other time I go over his house (so every other week or so). I make a point to gush to them over the things I bake and put photos on facebook. I haven't heard anything negative from them aside from one comment on how \"lol you're like a housewife\"\nFriends say to my face that the whole piercing thing and tongue splitting sucks and that he shouldn't say that, but I'm over it. Mulling it over, I don't want them after all and I don't bring up the subject again.\n\nHere's where it gets ridiculous. I hear from a good trusted friend that they're talking behind my back about how my boyfriend is being manipulative and abusive by telling me what I can't do and that I need to stop \"pampering\" him. That I, as a Native American/Black woman am being oppressed by my white boyfriend and it's disgusting them. I don't even know.\n\nThe boyfriend has been nothing but a gentleman, very chivalrous, treating me, and giving me thoughtful gifts and all that jazz. Now maybe I'm just stupid, but I don't think there's anything wrong here. I told my boyfriend and he seemed a bit distraught. Do I just stop telling my friends everything and confront them, or drop it? Do I stop what I'm doing for the bf because I'm somehow being manipulated?\nTL;DR:"}

He's an awesome person. \n\nPrior to us dating, I had a FWB thing going on with this one guy for about 7-8 months. We saw each other once every 1-2 weeks. Towards the end he seemed always too busy to meet up, and I got the vibe he didn't want to see me anymore, which was fine with me as I was wanting to seek a more serious relationship at that point. I met my now-BF 6 months later. \n\nEarly on in our dating, my boyfriend stayed at my place one night. The next morning we decided to get breakfast and he asked if I had a fresh shirt he could wear. I'm rather petite so I don't have much in men's sizes. The only clean thing I could come up with was a t shirt from my former FWB. I felt a little weird giving it to my BF but at that point I didn't know exactly where our relationship was going, and it seemed like an inconsequential thing. He asked me where it came from because he liked the graphic on it... I shrugged and said I thought it was my brother's. I wasn't gonna tell this guy I was just recently dating and really into that it was from the last guy I hooked up with...\n\nFast forward to now, the shirt pretty much lives at my BFs house. He has claimed it and wears it often, and has even mentioned he likes it cause it reminds him of me. This makes me feel guilty... Plus we live in a large town but not large enough to not occasionally run into people. We actually ran into the FWB guy once, and I have some mutual friends with FWB still. I'm paranoid of running into FWB with my boyfriend while he's wearing that damn shirt. \n\nSo should I tell my boyfriend about the shirt's origin, should I just live with it, or do I steal the shirt back and make it...disappear?\nTL;DR:"}

She doesn't really talk to anyone else besides me. I found out she's been talking to a guy from NY. We are in Michigan by the way. When I found out initially,she told me they were just friends. At least that's what I thought. I found out she has a fetlife account and has been messaging this guy for quite a while. I eventually saw a message where he was talking about what he wants to do to her sexually. This really hurt my feelings. I brought this up tp her and she just reassured me she's never leaving and only did this because she's lonely since I'm the only person she talks to and I work 5 days a week. At first, I was really upset. I already know I can't live without her. I'm her only source of income and she has a strained family relationship too. After this, she got to talking about threesomes/group sex. I'm not against the idea, but I'm not sure how I feel.

Growing into our own personalties, style, responsibilities, lifestyle, and goals. It was really fun. We had our fights, but nothing incredibly difficult.\n\n I started nursing school in 2013. I have to tell you, it was stressful. I was ripped away from my friends (my schedule was/is insane), gained weight, and was depressed. I didn't know how to balance everything. I graduate in May and I can say I have things figured out (but didn't until recently) and I think my boyfriend was frustrated. He was frustrated being around a ball of nerves (I almost failed out of school the semester before last), being around someone who was not confident (25+ weight gain from nursing school), and I was very insecure.\n\n I think he got exhausted and felt no happiness from the relationship and I understand that. I really do. I guess it is just hard because I finally figured myself out and how to balance school and personal life. I got all A's last semester and since December I have lost 9 pounds. I look great! But it's a little too late, I guess. We broke up on the 31st of December. He said he was finished and we broke up. A few days later he texted me and said \"I am not completely done. I am going to spend this next month putting serious thought into our future.\"\n\nNow, here I am. Lost. Should I not contact him until he contacts me? Should I not go to sleep at night with hope that we will get back together after a month? It is hard. I love him so much. He admitted that he isn't completely done because he see's my potential. I feel like I made our relationship go downhill. I was always sad and never happy. I always snapped. I feel awful. I took one of the most wonderful things in my life and let it fade away with my emotions. I am so lost.\n\nAny advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I just found her legs more attractive when they were slimmer is all. Overall, though, I think she looks great.\n\nShe didn't take this well at all. I mean, I can't say I didn't expect for her to be a little taken aback, but I was hoping for a resigned, \"yeah, you're probably right, I should get back in shape.\" Instead, she got incredibly upset, saying I should be able to look past a flaw such as this, because it's not like her legs were out of control big or anything. She says she's very upset because now she knows that I see the same thing she does (she's to happy with the way her legs look either) and just feels insecure.\n\nSo Reddit, was I wrong to express my feelings about the fitness of my girlfriend's legs, or is she taking the suggestion too seriously and maybe blowing it a it out of proportion?

I hope you're all having a great day. \nI'll try and keep this as simple as possible. Been with my S/O for just short of 18 months. She is my world, since we got serious I have always saw us being together through life and I can't really imagine how I would live properly without her around.\nWe would usually spend a few days a week together, we don't live together but we would stay over at each others houses and it was all great. Recently she started working very long hours, 10-12 hours a day and 5 days a week. Obviously this is difficult, that's understandable. However, the problem I'm having is it leaves very little time for us to see eachother. I expected to have every weekend together however it's not that simple. She is very tired after work so I can't come to see her weekdays, and she is out of the house at around 6:30 am and it is inconvenient for me to be at her house all day without her. She said that she does want a social life with her work friends as she will be stuck with them for at least 2 years. We can't move in with eachother yet as we do not make enough to get by with rent and bills comfortably. Neither of us drive yet but she is close getting a license which will help. \nWhat does this all mean? Well, she's going to be going out on work nights out every few weeks, which means I won't be able to see her, then she has assignments to do over other weekends which means I may not be able to spend the day with her. It could be as little as once a day every 2 weeks.\n\nLike I said at the start, I don't want this to be over. I'm willing to make sacrifices if she is too. I just want to know if anyone has any advice on how I can make this easier for both of us? I really need help here and it is on my mind constantly and its emotionally hurting me. Any advice will help, positive or negative. \n\nSorry about the long post folks!\nTL;DR:"}

Maybe a book or a movie or accessories or something like that? Little things that feel more like a gift your family would give you or something. But I think I'm going to wait to do those things until close to Christmas, seeing as different women come and go of the shelter every few weeks. ALSO possibly a toy drive for the children that live there, but the staff at the WC told me they usually get enough toys for all the kids but the women don't usually get things other than basic donations, so that's a 2nd priority.\n\nANYWAY, what I need to know is how I should go about collecting funds for my little project. Obviously things like donation boxes, bake sales, donation jars in local restaurants, etc; but what about larger scale things like business (local or corporate) sponsors?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25 M] with my GF [24 F] for 3 months, want to get back together with her abusive ex\nPOST: I met this very religious girl in my old office. She is a smart and gorgeous girl, unfortunately that she is too skinny and doesn't look joyful at all. So, she wasn't my type. She complained about her BF who beginning to abuse her verbally out of neediness and jealousness to me and my friend. I and my friends knew that this is the beginning of an abusive relationship. Their relationship deteriorates to the point that she got slapped and broke up. I knew that he would beg her for another chance and begin another cycle of their abusive relationship again and again.\n\nI have a bad habit of taking other people (male, female, beauty, ugly) issues as my own. So, I tried to give her support during her depression period and show her how bad her previous relationship was. She revealed to me about her abusive father who kept spying Facebook of everyone in the family. I took pity of her and developed feeling for her in the process. We dated each other about a month later (In my defense, I'm not the kind of \"NICE GUY\" who use kindness to get sex).\n\nHer ex kept harassing her from times to times during this 3 months period over the text, but she never blocked him. She didn't want me to do anything just to be safe and tried to hide this from everyone at her church.\n\nFor the past week, both of them began to talk with each other again. She told me that she talked with him as a friend and didn't want him to do anything crazy. Until this weekend, when he saw us together and began to treat her over texts then blocked her before she could text anything back. She was really scared of him and decided to stay at a hotel instead of her apartment for the week. We planned to find her a new apartment just to flee from him on the next weekend (We can't move in together because her new office is really far away from my home).\n\nLast night, I tried to comfort her. We talked for a while. In the end, she broke down and confessed to me that she can't live without her ex. She rather gets beaten than living without him.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not looking to date anyone.\nPOST: Firstly, this is a throwaway account. Secondly - around 2-3 years ago I became friendly with my coworker. We're both exceedingly shy, and even then I was reluctant to enter a relationship, so nothing ever materialized. Eventually I started dating my best friend of 5 + years. We dated for almost 2 years, but separated a couple of months ago. I didn't hang out with my coworker during the relationship out of respect for my boyfriend, though we we did occasionally bump into each other at work.\n\nNow my coworker must have heard that my boyfriend dumped me, because today he asked me out to lunch. Due to personal reasons (mental illness, various complexes, & other overly complicated things that nice people like my coworker do not deserve to be subjected to), I have decided that I do not want to date anyone for a long, long time. Possibly ever.\n\nI plan on sending him this message, but I need a second opinion before I launch it into cyberspace:\n\nI wanted to let you know that I'm down for lunch tomorrow, but I also wanted to make sure that I'm clear about my intentions. I know I've never explicitly said it, so I hope this doesn't make things awkward, but obviously I've had a crush on you for a long time now. At the same time, I am in no position to get involved with anyone in the foreseeable future. I'd rather not go into detail over facebook, but if you ever wanted to talk about my reasons in person, I'd be willing to. If you don't want to hang out after reading this... I understand. Seriously. But if you do, I'm happy to pay for lunch - if you're able to pick me up, that is!\n\n(The last part is because we became close friends when I started providing him rides to and from work. Recently, he got his license, so he joked that I wouldn't have to pick him up and drop him off like normal.)\nTL;DR:"}

Decided to make some good ol' Bagel Bites, since i'm too lazy to actually cook anything. While waiting for the delicious little wheels of bagel, sauce and cheese to cook, I sat down at the counter and pulled out Ifunny. After looking at some pics, I looked up and noticed the microwave had 5 seconds left and hopped off the chair, which is about 2, maybe 3 feet, tall. Experimentally pulling myself forward, I noticed that something was pulling on my pants. Twisting myself around, I noticed my belt loot wrapped around one of the decorative twists in the metal. No problem, I thought to myself, as I try to maneuver the loop off the metal swirl. A few seconds in I realized I was in way over my head, as the loop was actually smaller than the swirl of metal! I was hesitant to take off my pants, as I was sitting in the middle of the living room, and my brother was home, but the only other option was ripping off the belt loop, which was out of the question, since I like these pants. The chair, as I mentioned, was 2 to 3 feet tall, and I couldn't quite stand up to get a better grab at the loop, or to comfortably take off my pants. In the end, I realized I had to take my pants off, and had to contort my body enough to crouch on the chair while pulling my pants to my ankles, then sitting down and pulling them the rest of the way. \nI ran to my room in my boxers, and snagged another pair of pants, before going back to retrieve my pants, which took another minute. Luckily, my brother never left his room and I still got to eat my Bagel Bites.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm extremely curious seeing as how our relationship stopped on a dime and we haven't talked or seen each other in like five years. I look at her profile page and what I experienced next was insane amounts of pain and shock. I didn't expect for so much emotion to come pouring out of me.

I introduced her to my main group of friends who were in a circle, and entertained the occasional handshake from acquaintances who did not join our circle. \n\nShe had fun at the party, but later confided that I had hurt her feelings by not introducing her to everyone I talked to. I was unprepared for this response, and my immediate reaction was rationalize, explain my intention, and otherwise gloss over her feelings. We got into a fight about my reaction, and later she decided that she couldnt trust me with her feelings and emotions which led to a decision to stop dating. \n\nThe thing is, I realize this has always been how I responded when a partner has said I hurt their feelings.

We've been dating 4 years. \nWe're in a bad situation where I quit my job and moved in with him, much to his begging but also because it was in my best interest. That's not the point of this post and I'm lining up another job. \nThe point is I'm genuinely concerned for him and he is twisting everything into me doubting my sanity. The fights always start late at night. Maybe he is just not a night person but I just can't excuse this behavior. He's been severely depressed recently. Like can't enjoy anything, lashing out depressed. Lying on the sidewalk mid going out crying. The fights always start late at night. I'll stop responding and lie in bed, but if I try and touch him and he'll recoil like I branded him. If I try and cuddle him he'll scream that he needs space and that he can't sleep comfortably while cuddling. I guess I understand but when you've been fighting I feel like maybe make a 15 minute exception to cuddle and make up? But whatever, I'll go to sleep. Except that he then keeps screaming and runs to the couch to sleep, and when I go tell him to stop being fucking insane and come to sleep he'll act terrified like I'm going to stab him. He'll be like stop having a mental breakdown. And sometimes I feel like I am with him. I think I should talk to his mom or brother or something but I'm afraid he's already painted me as crazy in their eyes. So I have no idea how to approach this subject with them without them thinking I'm being clingy or something. Do I just walk away? 4 years of love and trust makes me feel like I owe him more than leaving him alone in this obvious time of need for him but I feel really insulted and abandoned\nTL;DR:"}

I was depressed back then, and I'd often talk with her about my problems. I'd also cheer her up if she was feeling bad. We'd also talk about other things. You know, stuff like science, hobbies, basically anything. She had anxiety (is that how to say it?) due to a few things which I'd rather not share here. Basically, we'd just talk everyday and one of us would cheer the other one up if he/she was feeling bad. She knew me better than anyone else did, and I was the only one she trusted with her personal things (and her therapist, ofcourse). In short, we were REALLY good friends. \n\nIt's been close to 9 months. She basically \"disappeared\". She doesn't log into the game anymore, she doesn't reply to emails anymore.

Throwaway because my girlfriend knows me reddit account.\n\nI've been with my girlfriend for about a year and a half now, but we've known each other for nearly five. We started as a long distance relationship and after about six months of that bullshit we decided to move her to my state. Things were a little rough while she was looking for a job but once she got it things were going excellently. Then I got cancer. She has stuck by me and proven that she for sure loves me. I love this woman with all my heart.\nProblem is I think I might be in an abusive relationship. Before we got together I was really active socially. Had a lot of friends, went to their parties, hung out with a rather diverse crew, etcetera. My girlfriend isnt very social so she never wanted to go to these and would always encourage me to stay home. When she did go, she would ignore everyone else and just dote me with affection to the point of it being uncomfortable. At the time I thought nothing of it.\n\n About a week ago she was going through a very low phase (she's depressive) and did something that shocked me: She cut herself. The reason why? \"When im alone I can barely control it. I need to be around someone else so I dont have that option.\" I made her promise me that it will never happen again on threat of me leaving the relationship. She promised, and I think she means to maintain her promise. However I cant help but think that its a form of intimidation tactic to keep me around her. Im going on a weekend trip with my father and a few friends this weekend and she has been completely distraught about it. She tried to get to go with us at first by saying she could stay with family down there but we dont really have the money for it (father is paying for the trip). I just dont know what to do here.

We agreed that I'd pay her back for my share of the rent by transferring the money to her bank account when I started working.

The problem is, I am starting graduate school and used up the money I'd saved (including the money I'd put aside to pay her back) for tuition (in addition to taking out student loans). I have no income and won't for at least the next two years. I tried to explain this to my friend, but she became really angry and said I was being unfair and was taking advantage of her.\n\nI know I should have set the money that I owed her aside and not used it for tuition, but after almost three years of not mentioning it after I asked for her account info, I truly thought she decided not to ask me to pay back my part of the rent.

However I had a chance to meet up with her earlier this week. Now i always had a tiny crush on her over the years but I thought nothing of it because we would probably never meet. However as you can see I did meet her. \n\nHow I acted was being my normal self however. Since I play video games a lot that is my comfort topic but I felt like I never needed to resort to it because we were always talking about other things. For once in my life I felt calm around a girl like I could talk about any topic and she would listen. \n\nI guess the hard part is that she has a lot of what I look for in a girl and it just saddens me that we good friends because maybe just maybe it could happen. I just have so many doubts in my head because we are 1000 miles apart and idk if she has the same feelings since she friendzones everybody. The one time she didn't the guy turned into the biggest ass after a month and  dumped her. So I don't think she will even say hShe laughed at everything i said which I feel that is her personality. I just can't stop thinking about her and want to constantly text her. \n\nWhat should I do?

I'm head over heels for the perfect girl, but to her we're just friends. I've been completely in love with her since the beginning of this school year, and even just having a conversation with her seems like a treat. \n\nBut here comes the Shyamalan twist: I'm not coming to Reddit for help in winning her over. There are a few reasons why that wouldn't work. Firstly she has a boyfriend, and it doesn't seem like they're breaking up any time soon. And on top of that, she's way out of my league in the looks department. \n\nWhat I need your help with, Reddit, is getting over her. It seems like every time I'm about to get over her, she does something that makes her that much more perfect for me, and I can't seem to let go. For example, a week ago she approached me and told me how she loved Doctor Who and it was her favorite show. That may not seem like a big deal to most people, but being a major Whovian, it was to me. Things like that happen pretty regularly with her, and it makes it hard for me to let go. I really don't want to lose her as a friend, because underneath my feelings for her, she's still one of my best friends.\n\nI'm still in high school, and I know that this really won't matter in a few years, but that doesn't change the fact that it matters to me right now.

My boyfriend and I live together, work from home together, see each other a lot, so when baseball season starts I get seriously neglected, as well as his hygiene and manners.  He is normally so sweet and considerate, but everything changes when it's time for a \"draft\" or to conspire with his team co-captain or whatever.  If I have the slightest question, concern or need he either ignores me or takes this tone in his voice that makes me sick to my stomach.  I tell him this, and he blatantly doesn't care.  He thinks I'm being selfish because I have my own activities he's not involved in, but jeez I don't spend 8+ hours ignoring the world doing my hobbies.  And when I do I take it out of the house.  I make a point of getting out of the house for more than just meals.  He's a curmudgeony hermit at 31.\n\nHis coldness really brings out the anxiety in me and I've taken to popping xanax behind his back....again.  Sometimes it's the only way I can cope with life's regular stresses piled on top of his cold distant behavior.  He also has very little interest in sex and it's like pulling teeth to get him in bed. \n\nI don't know what to do.  I'd be more understanding if the season wasn't so long, and if he used a gentler tone when he tells me to \"fuck off\", but neither of those things are gonna change, so what can I do, reddit?  \n\nEven our cat is at her wit's end:\nTL;DR:"}

Yet, im still feeling bad about how things turned out and most of all, how big of an asshole i was and how inconsiderate jerk i was towards her.\n\nBasically, why i broke up was cuz i didnt feel the same for her as she for me even tho i had really much fun with her and everything was fine at first. I felt like there was not that spark, but was it just cuz i was too afraid to let myself fall in love again.\nI think i started fucking up our relationship by not telling her some things. Eg. when the previous girl asked me for a coffee and i did tell this only after i already had agreed to meet her. Also prior our dating, i was taking antidepressants, which i quitted last summer, so i been also afraid was my somwtimes general uninterest towards her due to the pills.\n\nIn the end, im afraid i was just too dwelled in my own problems that i didnt pay attention to her. Was i just too lazy to put any effort into this relationship. Also, im bisexual and sometimes i just wanted to do guys. But, now that everything is over i find myself missing her but is it just cuz im so lonely now. Also, sucks that only now i realize so many things i should have done differently and discussed about our issues and most of all that i wasnt being honest with her in the first place.

You know those Alphagettis you ate as a kid? They all taste EXACTLY like that (Hell, they're probably made by the same company, I don't really know). I'm not exaggerating here either.

She seems mostly concerned with the dogs since I will have to get up at about 7 to walk them and then go to school, but I convinced her that I can keep the house clean and feed myself. \n\nThe reason this is upsetting me so much is that I am currently 17, they always stress how much they appreciate how responsible I am, and how when I go to college I will be living on my own. I think allowing me to live on my own will give me a slight taste of what that is like, and at the same time I will demonstrate that I am capable of living on my own to them. But they won't let me. \n\nHow do I convince my parents that I am both responsible and capable of living on my own?\nTL;DR:"}

I guess you could call it a school holiday fling, as she is currently in her last year of high school her priorities are elsewhere, which i totally understand. \n\nAt this point in time her and I are both currently focused on our studies, and our contact has dropped off a heap. the only time I see her would be at the gym, however this is really only in passing. \n\nMy issue which has prevented me from contacting her further is her older brother. Some of my close mates are acquaintances of his, so I'd met him prior to meeting his sister. Prior to going out with her, he was not overly friendly, but at least he was polite and willing to say hello..\n\nSince I've been seeing his sister i could only describe him as hostile, and incredibly rude. \nNow the thing is I've never, ever had any issue with him. Never ever said anything bad about him, or have had ill feeling towards him.\n\nThe last 5 times I've seen him at the gym he just out and out will not acknowledge my greetings. Tonight it got to the stage where he stood over me whilst  i was picking up a weight, his attempt at physical dominance. I don't feel threatened, but its just gotten so ridiculous.\n\nI truly don't know how to address this issue, because i know if i was to go to her, shed probably just flip it off as, \"oh thats just (Brother) for you\"\n\nId truly appreciate your advice on this situation.

No clue where to post this\n\nSo, I'm 17(F) at the moment. For the past five years I've been uncomfortable with the shape and size of my breasts, no matter how they've changed through puberty. Recently I've lost quite a bit of weight and so I have gone from a small D cup to a large B cup. They are quite saggy and flimsy, and my nipples are too big for my taste. I mean, you get it. I'm not happy nor have I ever been, this is something I've thought about for a while.\n\nToday I found a really good deal for getting an enlargement (at a place I had already been looking at, nothing shady whatsoever) and I've started talking to my mom about it. I know I'm going to get my boobs done at some point in my life - I'm just wondering if getting them done now would be bad in any way? I'm asking about the pros and cons of getting an enlargement/lift/nipple reduction at 18. The thing is, I wouldn't be able to wait another five years - it's just too tragic having to look at them in the mirror every day - so if it has to do with waiting ten years then I'm going to go for it (depending on what my mom says, as I would need to borrow money from her).\n\nAny extra information would be that I'm planning on getting back up to a D but more of a full D cup this time. I haven't been to a consultation yet of course as I am very early on in this process but I would guess I am in need of foremost a breast lift. Being that I want them larger that too would be necessary and then the nipple reduction may be less so once the size of my breasts is different.\nTL;DR:"}

The Lincoln was shaking and bouncing up and down from the rear. Something busted the back left window. After 30 seconds or so it faded a little so we resumed trying to escape this cemetery. Every path was blocked so I went off-road across graves. Eventually I was cut off by trees, but I tried through a risky gap anyway and got the Lincoln stuck teetering on a footstone.

Before you go calling me a sorostitute or a frat rat or what have you, know this: Most of the brothers are good friends of mine and I have never dated a brother or slept with a brother. Drunkenly kissed a few of them, but that's it, and there is absolutely no bad blood between me and any of the guys.\n\nThe guy in question (let's call him Billy) has been crushing on me for the better part of two years (confirmed via my gossipy friends) and I have \"friend-zoned\" because previously I was not interested in a committed relationship. He has taken me as his date to the annual christmas cocktail party two years in a row (at my suggestion), we have made out once (at which he was surprisingly good), but he is somewhat shy when it comes to asking women out. However, a few things have changed, and I now think that I would like to date him.\n\nFirst, Billy has overhauled his appearance. He joined a gym, slimmed down, got a haircut for the first time in two years (THANK GOD) and did something about his caterpillar eyebrows. While incredibly shallow of me, he looks much more presentable now, attractive even.\n\nSecond, and this is the bad part, Billy is now the Vice President of his fraternity. Being his girlfriend would give me considerable status and access to privileges such as t-shirts, sober drivers, better seating at football games in the fall, potential Sweetheart status, and some authority to boss pledges around (which admittedly I do anyway).\n\nI do find Billy attractive, we have lots of similar interests, and we get along well. I am tired of being single (I have been for the past 3 years by my own choice) and I want to try a relationship for a change. My question is two-part. A) If I date him, am I going to look like a gold-digging whore who's only in it for the perks and out of convenience, and B) how do I go about asking him out without looking like a gold-digging whore?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm happy but I have awful anxiety and our 'personality differences' (she can be quiet sometimes. I'm introverted but I talk a lot to her because I'm comfortable with her) sometimes cause me to be overwhelmed because I let my mind run and think she's being distant or something's wrong. To be specific she is a very short texter (laugh if you want to it's 2013). It's to the point where when we first started talking I would think she's wasn't interested. It's really not a big deal when I'm calm but when I get the anxiety it's crippling. It stresses me the fuck out. I guess this is more of a personal issue now that I've thought about it. \n\nReally I think this has to do with a past relationship where I got cheated on for 6 months. I'm paranoid. I trust her but I'm worried as shit. Partly because she's really insecure and I've always heard that insecurity is the first sign of infidelity. BUT she's been this way from the beginning. She's not crazy or anything but she gets jealous very easily. As do I.\nTL;DR:"}

Since this time, my friend Gregg has near-constantly invited me to things without inviting anyone else. For the most part, I have made up excuses and not gone but I feel guilty for shrugging him off and sometimes say yes (i.e. I have recently gone to a football game with him). My friends have all told me its strange, and my current boyfriend has raised some minor concerns with the situation. Everyone gets the vibe that Gregg really likes me despite the fact he knows I'm in a relationship.\n\nToday I decided to tell Gregg that we should tone down the intensity of our friendship. He didn't take it too well. He accused me of letting other peoples opinions and gossip ruin our friendship. He said that it must be my bf attempting to stop us from seeing each other (which it isn't). \n\nI should also mention that since people told me how odd it is that Gregg keeps inviting me out, I have begun to notice that he does have a thing for me. So in a way, peoples opinions have influenced my view on the matter, but only because I'm a bit aloof when it comes to getting hints that someone likes me. \n\nBut anyway, the messages he is sending me are very accusatory and very defensive (I'm sorry we can't be friends because people think I'm in love with you; way to go for making me feel like a creep; I've been dealing with a lot recently and you're not making it any better). I never said he was in love with me, I never said he was a creep, I just wanted to tell him that if we wanted to stay friends, maybe we shouldn't do things that are being construed as couple-y.\n\nHave I done the wrong thing r/relationships?\nTL;DR:"}

We had been having problems before then, but we had talked them out thoroughly (well, from what I thought) and then we were having a bit of a rough night, we got to talking intensely and I can't exactly remember what it was about, but the result was eventually that he came out with that he was 'having doubts' in a lot of things, mainly our relationship. \n\nI was shocked, I had no idea about this and I didn't have any clue he has feeling this way (I know he tends to bottle up his emotions, but I try to encourage him to tell me everything he feels is important) but he said he wasn't sure about it, even then. I was completely heartbroken, and I asked him if he still wanted me. He said that.. he didn't know. He wasn't sure if he still wanted me, and my worst fear came true - I could deal with anything else, but for some reason I've always felt that being told you're not wanted anymore is kind of the end of the line. \n\nOn the phone, he ended up, while I was crying my heart out admittedly, saying that we should probably break up. I'm ashamed to say that I begged him not to do it, and give me another chance. The morning after, he told me that he wanted to give us another chance. The days after were full of some of the most depressing days I've had in a long time, to be honest. He's told me that he still always loved me, but even so, I feel that I don't necessarily believe him 100%, and even now, I'm haunted by him saying that, and feel as if he's going to leave me one day because he suddenly doesn't want me, even though he says he won't do that.\n\nAm I being too much?

She has the same problem. This combined with her currently not-so-high self-esteem led her into depression. She always tell me she has lost her passion towards drawing and design (said that she once has) and she now feel like it's a chore. She says sometimes she does it just for the grade, and can't really imagine herself doing that as a job anymore.\n\nHonestly from my point of view she has the talent and all, but she just doesn't have the confidence. She still have one of the highest grade in her class, and I fixated my point on that. She keep looking at other people's art and feel bad about herself. I tried (and still trying) my best to lift her mood up everyday.\n\nAs a person who have found my own solid passion (computer science) I feel lucky but feel bad at the same time because I do not know how does it feel to be in her situation. Almost every night we skyped and she cries herself to sleep because of her lack of enthusiasm and motivation she once had.\n\nSo I turn to you to ask for advice. How do you help a person with depression about self-esteem? Is there any method or program? I know it's not easy and must take a lot of time, but I'm willing to help her.\n\nAlso please note that we come from a country where society and people are not as easy as in the EU/US. In our country people judge a lot on how we dress/look and therefore she also stressed by seeing all other classmates' works as well. Also, she tried therapists but they doesn't work ...\nTL;DR:"}

She never received praise growing up, only cold family love, and the constant reminder that she wasn't excelling enough by their standards. Our initial connection was that we both came from large families (6 siblings each).\n\nIn the past 1.5 years, I have attempted to break up with A numerous times. It would start with something relatively small: I was inconsiderate about something, or she was a little too bitchy to me, it would devolve into a full blown fight, and I would get exhausted. I'm very pro-independence, personal autonomy, and experiencing life, so the idea of staying in a relationship that doesn't make me happy is foreign. She, on the other hand, is used to working on relationships even if it's riddled with fighting. To her, her friends, and her family, fighting and near-breakups are common. Every time the breakup is almost \"sealed\" - amidst shouting, and insults - she will break down in tears. And I cave. And we makeup. And I convince myself that I have to put more effort into this relationship, and make it worthwhile, since I'm not exiting it like I felt compelled to do.\n\nMy question is, with your limited information on my relationship, and understanding that situations are complex, at what point do I call it quits and realize a relationship is toxic...or even abusive? And when I make that decision, how do I go through with it?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: Is he stringing me along?\nPOST: Hey, guys,\nBeing a little girly and overthinking things here.\nSo, I (F,22) met this guy (a few years older) online and, after a few days of intense texting, he asked me out and we met. I thought we connected really well and we did kiss at the end of the evening. \nNext day after he texted me in the morning, we talked, but afterwards he didn't text for almost 24hrs until I messaged him the next afternoon. We talked a little again, then the next day he texts me first again, we each had our own events but sort of spoke about meeting up later in the evening. I asked him if he was interested in seeing me again, he said \"of course.\"\nLater that night he called and offered to meet, but it fell through and it was really late - about midnight. We were both out with our friends and texting on the side all through the night. He then said \"let's do something tomorrow\", and when tomorrow came he did text - but didn't propose anything anymore.\nI then had a feeling he's stringing me along since the texting intensity slowed down, so I decided to stop texting him, but he's been messaging me every day since. It's now been a week after the date and while I casually offered something on Monday (he was busy - that was a legit excuse), he hasn't been offering anything in return. So why is he still texting me? Every day. Not as intensely as before, but every day. Would he really bother so much if he's just stringing me along? Waiting for the next friday/saturday night when he's drunk and horny? Don't want to invest my time in that, but don't want to be un-polite and not answer if he is interested, but simply slow in his communication. \n\nExperience, advice, thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

We both still have in the back of our minds we might get back together... we've been broken up for 2 weeks now. We both still love each other but there has been problems we can't get over.\n\nPartially due to the fact that I have human instincts, partly due to the fact that i was supposed to marry this woman and STILL LOVE HER, and partly due to the fact that i feel some weird feeling regarding the fact that she never hooke dup with another guy, but if i found out she hooked up with someone right now it would DEVASTATE ME.\n\nGiven that feeling, I think it is safe to assume it would devastate her if she found i hooked up if someone. Basically, I don't think i can hook up with someone bc i know it will kill her, and ill feel too shitty. Also, i feel like it would kill the little chance we have left of getting back together. I am fairly positive, the advice would be just to do my thing and I can't worry about her feelings, but am looking for some thoughts.

She says she wants to take a break.\nPOST: Okay, so things between me and my SO have been pretty rough the last few months. Although through the last couple of weeks they have gotten much better. However she told me she wants to take a break. She wants freedom for a little bit. She essentially told me she wants to break things off for a month and in her words \"sleep with other guys\" she keeps telling me she loves me she just wants to have other sexual experiences. I am okay with this to an extent. I love her very much and she keeps telling me she loves me. Is this just her way of putting me down easy?\n I honestly don't care about the sex. It means nothing to me. I shouldn't say nothing, but that is not what is bothering me about this. I mean I want to have sex with her and stuff. But I don't like the idea of her just being friends with someone and constantly hanging out with them for sex. It is the potential for a new emotional connection. I even said I would be okay with an open relationship. She basically told me she wants to get crazy before she settles down with me. I just don't see how this is going to make her want to settle down I guess. \nShe keeps saying it will only last a month, and may be shorter. I'm just worried she wont come back. Is this me being insecure? I am of course going to be pursuing sex with others as well, but I know that is all I will really want out of it. I really see myself marrying this girl I just don't know how to take this.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience to this? Do you think this could really solve my girlfriends issues? Could she have commitment issues? \n\nLike I said the sex doesn't really mean much to me. It's the fact that she wants attention and sweet things from someone else that hurts my feelings.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Which CC Should I Pay Off Next?\nPOST: Hi PF!\n\nI'm so close to paying off my first credit card as I'm working on eliminating my personal debt. I started with my card that has the highest interest rate and should have it cleaned off with my next paycheck. Now I need to know where to go next. \n\nI currently have two cards that are 0% interest rate that I've been making minimum payments on while working on my cards that have charged interest. One card doesn't have interest that kicks in for another year but I have one that comes up in February. The balance is $1778 and when the interest rate kicks in it will be at a ridiculous 22.9% which is WAY higher than any interest rate than I have. The next card that I would have moved on to after paying off my first has an interest rate of 15.9%. \n\nWhich card should I pay off first? The balance on the 0% card is significantly smaller than the 15.9%, and I have worked out some math. I could have 0% card paid off in Feb by paying $112 each pay check and I would still have some money left over for the snowball method for the 15.9% card. Should I go that route to eliminate another debt while avoiding the future high interest? Or is there a way I can still take advantage of the free interest period while making good progress on my other cards?\n\nYour insight and advice is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend has been in several previous long term relationships.\n\nShe has a lot going on right now and feels rushed for time and stressed, balancing a lot of work/gym/studying time. Because of this she can only see me maybe once a week recently and for the next month, which I am ok with and want her to be successful with her own life as much as possible. We love each other and have a healthy relationship in general.\n\nThe issue that has arisen, she has told me is that I don't offer her the kind of support she is looking for in her own life. As I am not used to being in a relationship and still have a lot of self doubt; I constantly question myself before texting her. My mind will typically even go blank and I can't think of anything to say out of fear of maybe saying something to upset her or causing a fight. In general I am quite a quiet and reserved person which is a trait I am trying to get over. This doesn't mean that we never have laugh or anything, more that I don't use opportunities to connect with her (or others). I will usually end up texting something like \"miss you x\" in the hopes of sparking a conversation but has resulted in her feeling guilty that she cant see me so often.\n\nWhat I would really like is advice on how to connect with her better and to get over my own anxieties. In general my social skills have been built through practice over many years and I dont have any experience here. Personally I do not currently study and most of my time is dedicated to the gym or working full time. I like watching movies/tv shows or playing games quite a lot (among other things) in my free time which she just does not have the time for in general so it can be hard connecting when we don't have a huge amount in common. I just want her to feel like she can talk to me about anything and that I will be able to respond in a positive way and vice versa.\nTL;DR:"}

He didn't know my secrets, he didn't know about my past bout of depression or that most of the time I still feel like crap, yet I expected that he would make me feel better.  \n\nAnd there he was, totally honest about his anxiety disorder and I did everything I could to be there for him.  In my case, I was too proud to be honest about my faults, and didn't want to bring him down with any negativity, thus the relationship went no where.  \n\nAfter breaking up with him he mentioned that he always wanted to get to know me better, he wanted me to tell him everything about myself, even though he had never explicitly said so.\n\nNow I'm stuck here thinking that if I would have been more open, and if he would have asked more questions, things would have been great... I could have fixed him, he could have fixed me... and we would have both turned out for the better.  Instead I tried to fix him and he wondered why I wouldn't open up.  Neither of us asked for what we wanted, but now i realize you can't just expect things if you don't tell people you're expecting them.\n\nI think the worst part is that he was great otherwise, super nice never did a thing wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

What personal paradigm shifts or epiphany have you experienced in your life?\nPOST: Today I got in an argument with my friend and in the course of our discussion she said something to me that made me realize that I had the wrong attitude for a long time. The story behind that is that someone at college who I've made a genuine effort to be nice to (because she is mutually friends with my friend) had butted into my conversation and called me out for being a bitch. I was sorta bitchy, it was early in the morning and we were in physics. I digress. I was pissed at this person because she didn't extend the courtesy that I extended to her because of our mutual friend. I was mad at my friend for defending her as well. She kept saying I needed to not let other people bother me. I'd been given this advice many times but at that moment everything fell into place. I had been making things harder for myself. I was upset over things that didn't even matter. Those people don't care if they've upset you. It doesn't mean anything to them. It just clicked.I needed to let go and not care what other people think about me, because in the end, you know who you are and what's important about you and whether people think you're a bitch or not is irrelevant. This seems obvious but its taken til just now to sink in.\nAnyway. I wanna read your stories!\nTL;DR:"}

She started dating somebody relatively soon after that, and even though we were still friends it still made me really uncomfortable. Our \"friendship\" was muddled with residual feelings and she would like to talk about things us having sex, our past relationship etc.\n\nShe would make offhand comments about how she thought her current relationship was unsatisfactory, and me being naive I thought that she still had feelings for me and we would get back together. A few nights ago we started fooling around, and although we didn't have sex, we pushed the boundaries enough to know that we had \"cheated\". She said she wasn't going to tell the boy, and it tore me up and made me feel extremely guilty.\n\nWe went camping yesterday by ourselves (which was an absolute recipe for disaster), and we ended up getting drunk and having sex, which I had initiated. Woke up today and immediately left the campsite and she is furious with me. She said that we won't be talking ever again, seeing each other etc. which I know is best for us both, and she plans on telling her current boyfriend about what happened.

They can't handle the amount of texts and some graders admitted not reading them at all. **Someone wrote the anthem of a soccer team as his essay and got 500/1000, while a professor who wrote a perfect essay got 420**. *Here's the scan of the anthem essay for proof:  (google for \"hino do palmeiras\" - that's what's wrote on paragraphs 2-3). There are countless cases like that.\n\nSo half of the final score is essentially random, which means college places are essentially being filled randomly! A teenager can't chose his career anymore. I've personally seen friends who studied for years dreaming of engineering crying for their destroyed careers, while people who spent the high school partying and getting straight F's are being presented with places on the best Medicine and Engineering schools! \n\nPlease notice the scale of the problem. There are already 40000+ students in a Facebook group debating the issue. We went to the streets, made videos, went to the justice and got media coverage, that's still a small portion of the 6000000+ who participated so the government simply ignores us. The majority don't know what's going on and think they failed / succedeed because they deserved! \n\nWe're out of ideas and hope. *PLEASE, REDDIT, HELP US!* What can we do?\nTL;DR:"}

For instance, I can't drive, so I sometimes ask him for a ride if he is heading in the direction I am. He will complain mercilessly about why can't I find my own way around places, I don't ask him to go out of his way or drop any activities for me but it seems like a total chore for him and asks why I never do anything to return the favour. I'll respond with a plethora of tasks I do around the house but he casts them aside saying they also are to my benefit as well so they don't count. I just can't win with him, am I being unreasonable?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My friend [22f] is in love with me [24m], don't know what to do\nPOST: I have a very close friend, let's call her Bonnie. Bonnie and I met 4 years ago at college and have pretty much got steadily closer over time until today she's one of my closest friends. Bonnie was going through some tough shit a couple of years ago, depression and stuff, which I helped her get through.\n\nI started getting attracted to Bonnie round late last year. Bunch of reasons: both she and I matured somewhat, got our heads relatively sorted out, and (sorry) she lost quite a bit of weight (she's never been fat, but she lost her puppy fat). Long story short, we hang out and make out a couple of times, with the understanding it won't go further.\n\nBit of background, I've recently got out of a relationship with Jasmine, halfway through last year. I was in love with her, but she went to study in England. We still exchange letters occasionally.\n\nBonnie told me two weeks ago that she was falling for me. We decided to stop making out/hooking up (we haven't slept together) for various reasons. We still hang out a lot (we live in the same neighborhood) and it comes up occasionally, but there's no drama. She's handling it like a pro. I've asked her about it and she's fine with being friends even if she'd like something more as well.\n\nThing is, I don't know what to do. Having trouble working out if what I feel for her is just v. close friendship + attraction, or something more. Also, I still have feelings for Jasmine, though it's practically certain we won't get back together. I really don't want to hurt Bonnie, and it feels like being with her when I don't know what I feel is risking that. I think she deserves more than a guy who's still got feelings for someone else, but if I'm falling in love with her that's different.\n\nWhat should I do? Stop the friendship with Bonnie for a while, just keep doing what we're doing and hope it'll be fine, or give a relationship with her a try?\nTL;DR:"}

Now, when they are the last messages I get before I go to bed and the first ones I have in the morning, and some often include a series of four pictures of the \"problem\", I can feel my blood pressure rising. Now, I'll admit, I'm not the perfect roommate, but nobody is. I do indeed try to oblige all his silly stupid requests, though in the last few weeks I have completely stopped responding to any of his bullshit messages. \n\nThe thing is is that he does plenty of shit that bothers me, too, like carrying around his stupid stereo ALL OVER the house, often waking me up or annoying me while I'm trying to sit down to a nice quiet meal in the kitchen, and never taking out the garbage, or leaving 2 week old, un-rinsed orange juice bottles on the counter until I return from holiday since he refuses to take out recycling. But I keep my mouth shut unless it is REALLY important to me because I realize that the cost of cheap rent is living with other people and having to accommodate their lifestyle and habits. I get it. I try to do that for all of my roommates. But this guy has so many complaints a day, and never talks to me in person about it. Should I say something? (Obviously I think if I do say something it would have to include how the text complaints seriously make a negative difference in my day, and I apologize for any house-sharing inconveniences I have caused and will try to be better, but please only bother me if something is TRULY important, and talk to me in person about it then)\n\nAlso we only have three months living together left, but this is enough of a thorn in my side for my last semester of school that I really want it to end.\nTL;DR:"}

However I still feel that she is teasing me every time she does it. Fast forward to today, and we talk about hanging out, we live about 1 hour away as we go to different university's. She is telling that she is looking forward to it, she tells that she will be there at a certain time. Though as that time gets closer she starts sending me lame excuse after the other. About an hour before she said she is going to be there, she tells me that she is taking a nap instead and is meeting up with her friends later that night, earlier than expected.

We talked a bunch from time to time, easy flirting here and there. So one day, after gauging her interest, I decided to ask her out. After having a very warm conversation with a bunch of exclamation points and \"lol\"s from her part, she answered with a obviously clear \"yea definitely, I'll let you know when.\"\n\nI knew right away based on her answer that it was a no. So I let it go. But I don't think she thought that was enough because she ended up changing her work out routine schedule so that she didn't come at the same time I did so that she could avoid me presumably. This went on for the past month I'd say. Then all of a sudden, just yesterday, she shows up at the gym for the first since I saw her about a month ago.\n\nShe was with her friend and I was with mine. I didn't pay attention to her at all and just went about doing my workout and shooting the shit with my friend in between. She saw me and looked over a couple of times but I didn't pay her no mind. Then when I went into a separate section in the gym far away from her to work out, she pops up out of nowhere with her friend and starts to talk to me like nothing ever happened. It made me feel emasculated for some reason like she didn't give a fuck about my space or what I thought.\n\nI don't know what she's doing and I don't know what to do myself. I personally would not want to be friends with someone who would just ignore me for weeks because she couldn't be honest with me but know that if I avoid her, she'll think I'm being petty.\nTL;DR:"}

I consider him my closest friend and I thought we have been in a really fun and awesome place, emotionally speaking. \n\nBrief summary; he told me he had sex with another girl last week (she's  a friend of his, also 18) and was worried sick/very guilty about how I would respond. He was ashamed of himself when he told me. For some reason, I wasn't angry, or sad, or even particularly surprised. Somewhat disappointed because it seems like he didn't think it through at all. But my reaction was...if he and I are happy together, and he's having sex with someone else, why should it matter? I understand love is not a limited/finite thing and he's been very good to me lately. I told him I didn't mind if he kept sleeping with her. He ended up spending most of his birthday with her. Was fine. He's made it very clear that he loves me and feels incredibly lucky.\n\nNow, however, I'm feeling insecure, and kind of lonely and sad.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by not listening to my bladder\nPOST: This happened just about and hour ago and is probably the most embarssing moment of my life. So today I was at a lacrosse goalie clinic because I am a fairly new goalie, and my coach recommended I went in hopes of me learning the fundamentals. Everything was going well and I was having a great day and learning a lot. There was about twenty minutes left in the clinic, and I was in the middle of a drill when I had the sudden urge to pee. I thought I'd be able to make it till the end and just kept on going through the drill. Pretty soon I didn't even know I had to pee anymore. Then in the middle of the drill without me even feeling it the flood gates opened and I completely pissed my pants. The coach asked if I was ok and I couldn't even respond. I was at a loss for words and then ran to the bathroom to try to clean up, but it was too late. I came back to apologized and everyone said it was ok, but I couldn't accept the fact that I just pissed myself in public. I planned on asking if I could get private lessons afterwards, but I didn't because I was too embarssed. I left before the clinic ended because I was to wet to continue. On the way home my father said that no one noticed because my pants were a dark color, but it was pretty obvious. Today I majorly fucked up, and if this story can teach you anything, it's don't think you can hold in your pee because you may piss yourself without even knowing.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: A question about macros.\nPOST: So I've been lurking on /r/loseit, /r/leangains, and even /r/gainit for a while. My current goal is to get down to about 10% body fat and then begin to slow bulk. Currently I'm about 180 lbs and though I'm not sure what my current body fat percentage is my weight loss goal is to get down to 160. If I had to guess I'd say my body fat percentage is somewhere between 14-20%.  \n  \nSorry for the preface, I'll get right to the point. From what I understand, to maintain as much muscle as possible while on a cut it's important to eat 1g of protein per pound of your goal body weight minimum. This helps to reduce muscle loss while cutting. A simple formula I found that I really like is to eat < 10 * current body weight a day to lose weight. Obviously this is simplifying what can be a complicated formula based on your activity level and other factors, but when double checked against the calculator in the FAQ this number hits a middle ground between the weight loss number and the more rapid weight loss number so I'm going to give it a try.  \n  \nUsing this simple formula, 10 * 180lbs = 1800 cals a day. To maintain as much muscle as possible I'm going to be eating at least 160g of protein a day maybe 170g just for satiety and because meat is delicious. SO, if a single gram of protein has 4 calories that means out of my 1800 cals/day 640-680 of them are coming from protein. My question is does it make a huge difference where the other calories come from?  \n  \nI realize that getting those calories from nutrient rich foods like vegetables is ideal, but hypothetically speaking, once I hit my protein requirements for the day would I still lose weight if the remainder of my calories came from nothing but ice cream? (As long as I stayed under 1800.) Please don't take this example too seriously, it's an intentionally extreme scenario. I'm just wondering if a certain split between carbs and fat is more ideal for weight loss.\nTL;DR:"}

In the past I had difficulty accepting this considering the horrific abuse my mother has suffered at his hands, but she has her reasons (financial mostly).

I have voiced concern in the past, especially considering my sister lives in my mother's home and has most of her bills paid by our mother, but have come to just accept reality. My mother accepts it because she loves her daughter, and otherwise my sister is a great person but I see it as a slight betrayal.\n\nMy sister is now traveling overseas, her first trip since the threats, and I do not feel safe at home.

They do/did lots of drugs, are extremely rude and disrespectful at group gatherings, my cousin hit on my girlfriend a family reunion, etc...\n\nWhat's so upsetting about all of this is that my immediate family (mom, sister, and myself) have been extremely close all of our lives. We have never abandoned each other since my extended family has taught us how not to be.\n\n* Current situation:\n\nMy sister hasn't spoken to my mom or myself in over 2 months. I'm very upset and worried for her (she was molested as a child by a fellow church member -- we're all atheists now except my mom) because of her past. I've always been her big brother. I've always been there for her and so has my mom. \n\n* What I think:\n\nMy sister seems to be upset because I was laid off work and am currently relying on unemployment to make ends meet and that my mom MIGHT lose her job because her union doesn't seem to want to represent the workers that are being mistreated (my mom stands up for herself and her co-workers as opposed to many others). I'm currently working a side business that is beginning to generate enough revenue to make my full-time job in the near future and the possibility that my mom will get fired is relatively low. \n\nThese tiny bumps in the road, that we all seem to go through, seem to devastate her.I know my sister is really stressed and worried for us, but simply not communicating with your family (my sister didn't even bother to call my mom on Mother's day) is not the way to go.

I'm new here, I sought out this sub because I've been stressing about this for a while. Thanks in advance for the help. \n\nSome background: I (21m) have been with my girlfriend (20f) for a year and a half, and we have basically lived together for almost a year. However, due to my parents' uber-Catholic values, we have had to lie to them about living together, and this has involved renting separate apartments. We dealt with it okay, she'd mostly stay with me and leave her room empty, but it has been a financial stress, because we know it would be cheaper to rent together. I tried to drop hints about us moving in together, but my parents flat out stated that if that were to happen, they'd stop supporting me financially (up until now, I have relied on them for university). \n\nNow the problem: both my GF and I are signing new leases for the upcoming school year. Her new place opened up sooner than mine, so I have all of my stuff here, and we told my parents I was staying in a spare room (I don't think they bought it, but they haven't said anything).\n\nLiving here has been great, and it makes so much sense financially for us to live together. I am also sick and tired of lying to my family, because aside from their antiquated values, I love and respect them greatly. I'm pretty sure I'm in a place where I can support myself financially, especially with the reduced cost of living together. \n\nSo the question is: Should I do this? I know it would be a huge help for both of us financially, and it would prevent my parents from having to pay for a lie they don't even really believe. From where I stand, it's the right decision no matter how I look at it. And if I do it, how and when do I tell my parents?\nTL;DR:"}

He has a 4 year old son from a previous relationship. \n\n In the very beginning of our relationship he cheated with BM. This caused endless, endless problems obviously and we went through a lot of ups and downs. Last year was bad. We were living together but I felt pretty taken advantage of money-wise, a little trapped by his expectations of me with his kid, and resentful of this woman I hated who I had to have in my life.\n\nLong story short, the final straw was his going back on his word about boundaries we had agreed upon with the ex (he wanted to have the option of going on trips with her and son if \"son ever wanted it\" and I said no). We officially ended it and really haven't spoken since.\n\nSo the current issue: I still have major, major feelings for him, and I think he does as well. I felt really good for a few months then the past couple weeks have been really emotional and realizing I didn't truly process everything. \n\nI made a possible mistake by texting him this rant that started out just finally venting all my anger towards him that quickly dissolved into this scary thought that I still love and want him in many ways. I can look back and see how we fucked so many things up, my part in it, and the good stuff too.\n\nNow I don't know what to do. I can't stop thinking about him. I don't want to regret lost love when we really still love each other but is it even possible to reconcile a relationship like this? I know I may sound naive and maybe I am, or maybe I'm just truly still messed up, or i don't know what, but our history is so convoluted and complex, it's hard to sort it all out in my head. \n\nWe spoke again yesterday and I am still thrown by how he thinks it's ok to nurture a friendship with his ex under the guise of it being for his child when he knows that, given our history and his cheating, it is hell for me. \n\nI don't even know what I'm writing here for exactly but I am confused and stressed and sad and breaking up fucking sucks.\nTL;DR:"}

I told her that night no I don't want to deal with something like that. That night was rough because I really did like this girl a lot and I haven't met a girl like this that I was interested in. So the next day I caved and told her that I was fine with just doing what she said. We spent that night together but the week following that was extremely unusual. We stopped talking the way we normally did (I felt like she was intentionally not talking to me). \n\nA week after that she told me that things are too messy and that we should just be friends.

My friend has no problem giving her money, but the child turns 2 yrs old shortly and he hasn't so much as seen a picture of him.  On top of that, the court froze his accounts, took out $2,000 for racked up child support (including the three months that he was unaware of), has been giving the mother all the information within his account so she can track what he spends his money on, and are completely aware of the fact that the mother refuses to let him have a relationship with the child and is living with a \"serious\" boyfriend. I guess I should point out that my friend is recently laid off, lost his car insurance after the accounts froze, and the courts told him to get rid of his car if he can't afford the payments because a car is not a necessity.

I was left on my own at 18 to figure out \"LIFE\". At the time the hype was go to college get a degree and get a job. So, I took out a private student loan. After 4 years of college my private loan matured to be about 40k. I have a good stable job ~71k a year. I want to pay this loan off as fast as possible. I'm paying 2k against it every month. I do have a budget set up and have been making these payments religiously. Also, I pay whatever extra I may have at the end of the month into it.\n\nI purchased a house last year for 80k. House valued at $87 at the time of purchase. Average house in the area is between 100k and 175k. I have added new HVAC, updated the electrical (new 200 amp breaker panel and GFI outlets etc), and updated the bathroom. I'm curious if all the upgrades would push my equity high enough to get a HELOC to cover my student loans.\n\nIf i tell my lender my plan (which they hold both my mortgage and my student loan) would they be willing to work with me a little more. Would it even be worth doing at the rate at which i'm paying on my loan. \n\nAlso i was told the complete amount of interest on a HELOC is fully tax deductible while education is only deductible up to $2500.\nTL;DR:"}

Since the break up I've talked to other girls but I haven't been able to find any one I can relate too or that ive felt the same way about since then. We are both 17 and the biggest issue with getting back together is probably the awkward factor with both sets of parents.\n  \n   Here's where it gets complicated. I had these hostile feelings towards her mainly from built up anger over the one time she lied to me. She told me that she was becoming best friends with this guy from another school during my sports season ( so she could apparently get more attention from me because she felt like I neglected her.) but now she's over the whole attachment thing and im over the lie. \n \n My friends and parents however have never really been fond of her.

We grew up together, attending elementary and middle school together and texting each other throughout high school and college. Around March of this year, I was asked by my mother why my friend and I hadn't started dating yet because of the great chemistry between us. We absolutely loved video games, writing stories, going on small adventures, watching movies and would frequently stay up late just talking about anything. I then proposed the idea to my friend and she said that her grandmother and parents had made similar comments to her as well. She was open to the relationship but she had no prior experience with boyfriends at all, she just felt too different from the people at her schools and couldn't get into a relationship for that reason. And thus we began to date.\n\nI was told that since this would be a relationship between friends, I should be trying to take things slow. It's October now and I've been doing just about everything that we did in the past with a few dates thrown in such as lunches, dinners, special events. And recently she told me about how she still feels a little uncomfortable around me, likely stemming from the lack of prior experience with guys and dating. She talked to her friend about it and the friend said, \"Well, sounds like you might just not be a very cuddly person.\" (I'm assuming this is referred to the lack of physical, non-sexual intimacy that would be common in couples such as holding hands and such) The only thing that's happening on a regular basis is the hugging at the end of the night before going home. I'm wondering if there's a way that I can proceed from here to help ease her discomfort because we do enjoy doing things together. I can honestly say that I would be perfectly happy in the long term with her. They do say sometimes the best relationships are the ones where both can wake up in the morning and say the person next to them is their best friend in the world.\nTL;DR:"}

End up spending some time, have a fun night.\n\nLater that night I get a text from a random number and sure enough its her saying she asked our friend for my number. At this point, I am kind of interested so I am thinking \"Cool! This could be good\". Well, its not looking too good.\n\nWe've been talking non-stop since that football game and we have both developed feelings for each other, but this was before she brought up her boyfriend. Of 2 years.\n\nI asked about the whole situation and she basically told me that she lost feelings for him a while ago and wasn't sure that she wanted to call things off with him, but after meeting me she had pretty much made her decision. A few days go by and they are still together and she still talks to me non-stop.\n\nI see her in the hallways a lot and I text her throughout school, and I constantly get things like \"Oh I would, but you-know-who is with me.\"\n\nI really was starting to like this girl and I still do, but this whole situation is making me uncomfortable and I don't want to ruin anything for that guy. I have absolutely no clue what to do because I want to continue talking to her but something is clearly wrong with this situation.\n\nTo add, I am not leaving matters unattended. I have brought this up to her several times and nearly every single time I do she responds with something along the lines of \"Oh, I don't have feelings for him anymore its really okay\". I really like her, but I'm trying to put myself in her boyfriends shoes (whom I don't know) and its just killing me.\nTL;DR:"}

Being an older student, I was a member of the group for about a year or so, in which I was poorly treated due to former misconceptions about me. Also, there are kind of like sponsors in these groups, in which the younger tend to be picked by them.\n\nThis was the kind of group where there are a big number of workers, a small group of coordinators, and an even smaller group of \"leaders\". However, everytime someone new enters, they are doomed either being grunts, or, if they are friends with the \"leaders\", end up themselves coordinators instantaneously, without doing a simple activity. Naturally, I left after a year because I thought to myself that there was no reason to continue there where everyone treated me bad.\n\nFast forwarding to nowadays, SO is trying to enter the group, putting out applications to join, and after asking my opinion (which I said that she shouldn't try to join), disregarded it because her \"sponsor\" said that it should, and I explained all the reality inside, in which its response was to ask me for help entering.\n\nHaving submitted an application, and being accepted for the \"drafting\" (They do drafts in order to find who is truly interested and devoted to helping), she learned that it would be on the eve of two exams and decided to go forward (She is a great student, always studying and striving to be better). However, after I said that she should focus on her studies, decided to get mad at me and pinpointing that I should be more supportive.\n\nAm I being too controlling of how she shoud react/act in its decisions? Is she being too irrational over my opinions, or disregarding them and useless? Am I already having the worst outcomes as expectations and shouldn't?\nTL;DR:"}

She broke up with me a few days ago, and now I'm unsure about how to act to possibly win her back. She told me that she still wants to be friends, and said \"I'm not saying that we'll never date again, I just need some time.\" We broke up on good terms, and both of us were sad, but she ended it for reasons I'm still unclear of. I guess she just started feeling differently about me. She tells me that I'm an amazing guy, but -- I don't even know. Who the hell knows what goes through a girl teenager's mind?\n\nAnyway, should I be 'friends' with her, and continue talking to her during class/hallways? Or stay as distant as possible and only talk to her when necessary? Also, spring break is coming up so that time apart will probably do us some good. After spring break however - so about 3 weekends from now - I was thinking about asking her to go running with me (we used to run together while dating).\nTL;DR:"}

For the first 8 months of our \"relationship\" he was dating another girl, that he told me was completely awful and treated him horribly which made me feel bad and I felt like I needed to take care of him. I've actually talked to the girl since they broke up and she's pretty great, he used her for money and for sex while cheating on her with multiple girls (including myself).\n\nI stayed with him because I believed that he really did deserve to be given a chance to be a real boyfriend but things continue to get awful. He hates my taste in music and is constantly talking down about all my favourite bands and artists, he also hates my style and mocks how I used to be fat (I'm recovering from aneating disorder, and this makes me break again). Things aren't just terrible though, when we're not having heated arguments where he's telling me that I'm always wrong and treat him terribly we're happy and we have fun.\n\nI almost left him last month for my best friend, that I've had feelings towards for years but I gave up any chance with him and just decided to stay with my current boyfriend but he ended up almost leaving me for his bestfriend's ex saying that it was because I could never genuinely appreciate his music and she did. We agreed on giving it one last chance because giving up 14 months seemed stupid, but all my friends were so upset with me for it because they find him controlling and rude. I kind of agree, but I can't tell anyone how things really are without having to face hundreds of I told you so's.\n\nAnd if you do feel like I should leave him, could you give suggestions on how to do it?

As the RA on duty tonight, I got a call from one of my fellow RAs who is sick and just trying to get some sleep. She tells me that there are people in the courtyard outside her room making a bunch of noise, so I go out into said courtyard where I see said group. They're all black students (I didn't care at the time, just relevant in a bit). I calmly go up to them and tell them who I am, that they're making a lot of noise and that I got a complaint.

I understand that there are places in the US and around the world where that matters, but I honestly don't give a single fuck if you're black, white, or purple.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [20 F] have a problem communicating with my girlfriend [25 F] of almost two years.\nPOST: One of the biggest issues in our relationship is communication even though we both feel like we understand each other and love each other. Her problem with me is that I am not literal, and she often takes everything that I say literally. For example, if I tell her that I am in a \"dark place\", she would take it that I am somewhere dimly lit, somewhere like a bar or something. I'm trying very hard to be as specific and as literal as she would like, but I am not used to communicating this way and we have realised that she often completely misunderstands what I say, which leads to quarrels.\n\nOn the other hand, because I am usually not as literal, I tend to read too much into the things that she says. For example, when she said to me that \"it will be difficult to be with you in the future\", I took it to mean that we do not actually have a good chance of being together in the future. However, she said that what she really meant was just that it would be difficult, that's all. I interpreted it to have the implication of us not having a future, though. This would not be a problem if she is always patient when I clarify things with her, but lately she has been getting frustrated even when am I clarifying things with her in a nice tone.\n\nWhat can I do to close up the gap between us due to these communication issues? It's really taken a very big toll on our relationship, we can't fight properly because even when we quarrel we misunderstand each other. What can I do to communicate better with her? I'll have to put in most of the effort because she's too pressured by work and family issues and would rather not have to be stressed out by our relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

You are useless and pretentious.\" (Not exaggerating) All this while I put my academic and professional career almost on hold, did not smile for four months, cried every other night, all the while helping her through doctors appointments, delivering medicines to her, taking her for tests and what not.\n\nThis routine was repeated through her exam stress (when I was also giving my exams, yet only helping her), and every stray thing that bothered her.\n\nYesterday night, she told me she would eventually want to keep the option of getting married open. I said that love is what is the present and the future for me. She said, for her, it was being settled. \n\nAnd then she told me I had used her, that she should have known I was a bad person who physically and emotionally took advantage of her. We never even had sex through our relationship because she wasn't comfortable with the idea, and I never pressured her into anything beyond what she herself proposed. \n\nI feel as if I have wasted two significant years with her. But I am not a vengeful person, while all my smallest mistakes are reported to all our common friends. I will be completely deserted by everyone in a few weeks. With her, I went through severe depression twice but I held on because I love her; I started stammering with no prior history of it.\n\nIt is hard to understand this as emotional abuse. I am having a hard time understanding that she could say, after all we went through, that I used her. I am doubting my own self. \n\nHow does one get over this.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/askwomenadvice\nTITLE: Was my comment sexist?\nPOST: Hi everyone. \n\nI just wanted some perspective on my behavior to understand whether or not, from your perspectives, I was being sexist. It may seem minor to some however I think that it is important for a number of underlying reasons. I'm not looking for validation or anything, just clarification so as to be more mindful in the future.\n\nBasically, a girl on facebook posted a picture of herself driving, well to be more accurate, of her parked in her car in a parking lot looking a little hysterical or excited and leaning in close to her wheel. It was a funny picture.\n\nThe comments from others were typical, either praising her or joking around. I made a joke asking who she hit this time? She posted a comment saying that sexist jokes would not be tolerated. I was at first quite baffled at her response and unsure if it was directed at me or not, so at least in my mind it was unexpected. I'm not sure of the sexist connotation so I asked for clarification and explained the basis of my joke (based on the above description of her picture). \n\nSomeone else made a joke about her to slow down and she joked about being a speedster, so perhaps in my mind she was ok with these sorts of jokes?\n\nI've never made a sexist joke in my life and do find all sorts of sexism distasteful, and I do try to be sensitive around that topic, hence the main purpose of this post. My intention behind the joke was innocent, it was not directed at women in general or based on any sort of mysogynistic impulses, it was just a light-hearted reaction to her picture.\n\nAt the same time though, she did interpret it that way so I don't want to invalidate her perspective or anything. I do understand that it's her wall and she can disallow anything she wants and that's fine. However, if one gets accused of sexism when it was not ones intention to be sexist, I would think that one would be allowed the space to clarify themselves. Is that reasonable?\n\nAnyways, she blocked/deleted me after I asked for clarification, so I was wondering if my joke and my reaction were uncalled for and deserving of censure.\n\nThanks,\nTL;DR:"}

She was religious and believed in no sex before marriage which I respected, so remained a virgin despite us both being in love. This suited me, since I feel sex is best reserved between two people in a loving, trusting and committed relationship anyway. I also have some sexual hang-ups and trust issues which make me uncomfortable losing my V to any old person. That being said, I would probably have been comfortable losing my virginity to her, but that's a moot point now.\n\nHowever, I've actually had someone have the audacity to suggest that we broke up because I didn't turn her on and she would have been willing to 'bend her rules and be a bit naughty' had I have been sexier. They told me other guys will be able to persuade her to 'bend her rules' because they're more attractive (sounds a bit\u2026rapey to me?) They've also told me that they think my 'I want to wait for someone I love' is a big excuse I use to massage my ego against the fact I'm a bit of a loser for being a 21 year old male virgin. Finally they told me that my valuing sex is part of my general naively idealist view of life, I should start thinking of us as animals with urges and accept it's so easy to get laid that the only reason I couldn't is probably because I am in fact unattractive. \n\nI'm feeling pretty awful about this. Do women look down upon men who are virgins after a certain age? I know that young men mock guys who they find out are virgins, especially high school/college age guys. At this age virginity is essentially a symbol of masculine energy and social status-hence why it ties so intimately into my self-esteem.\nTL;DR:"}

Since then I've enjoyed the freedom of being single. I've been on dates with a few people since then, but nothing serious. I play video games a lot online, usually with some \"internet friends\" of mine. I met this one in particular almost a year ago.\n\nWe have a lot in common, I can talk to him for hours about *whatever*, and we complement each other well. We realized we both liked each other, discussed it a bit, but given that we're far apart (like, across the country far apart) and there wouldn't be an opportunity for us to be together in the upcoming years - going to different colleges in different states -- basically said, \"oh well, that's too bad.\" Being together would mean one of us giving up our current plans as far as schools and careers go, and while if we had already been in a relationship for a while I might be willing to do something like that, it's very scary to imagine initiating a relationship by throwing everything else aside. \n\nBut we still talk and do stuff online together, and it's hard to just bury what I'm feeling. We had another deep, touchy feely kind of conversation recently again and he asked if I love him. I asked if he really wanted an answer and he backed down. While I admire him more and more, *love* is a pretty serious word and I'm really not sure about it. But now I can't stop thinking about it. And him. \n\nHe will probably be able to visit me in a few months, and I think that if we decided to really commit, seeing each other every few months would be doable. I'm just afraid to get into a relationship both due to the fact that I know something long distance will be very hard to do (my parents were in one, though, so I can't say it's impossible), and that this is a time in my life where freedom is important to me (due to age and my recent-ish breakup). However, I'm pretty enamored with this guy and I'm afraid to let this chance slip by because I was too afraid.\nTL;DR:"}

Got married very young and have changed a lot since that time. We used to be very sexually active. My wife and I met each other in our partying days. Since then we have both chilled out a lot except I put all that energy into other things and she hasn't. I am a very active person I enjoy being fit, dieting, working out and she is the exact opposite. I think living this lifestyle raises my natural testosterone levels causing me to have a high sex drive. \n   Because of this I find our levels of sexual desire to be completely off track. She never approaches me or tells me she wants sex, I have to chase or beg her usually and even then I get it only about once every two weeks, but i would like to have sex every couple of days. I think a lot of it comes from her not being happy with herself so I buy her things to wear lingerie that cover a lot of things on her body that make her uncomfortable. Which sometimes I can tell she likes and then other times she acts like it is the biggest hassle in the world. Ultimately I have come to the conclusion that she will never lose weight or live an active life style. Because of that I have realized I can't change her and trying is frustrating and pointless as it only leads to more fighting. I am just learning to deal with it and accept that, we're married and there's no law in marriage that says she has to weigh, or look a certain way.\n   I have been with her almost my entire adult life and would be happy staying married to her forever but this is a constant frustration and I wonder if temptation will get the best of me, and if it does, is it then my fault or was it cause and effect? I hate having to beg her to have sex with me, it gets me extremely aggravated and makes me feel very unwanted.\nTL;DR:"}

I let him get me off with his hands once, and it felt good, but I felt so completely weird about it afterwards that I asked him not to do it again. He's been making repeated offers to perform oral sex on me, but I am kind of grossed out by the idea of someone's mouth anywhere near my genitals, and I feel like if I let him do things to me I will have a karmic obligation to reciprocate, and I'm still highly uncomfortable with the male body.\nTL;DR:"}

It went pretty well, IMO, and he showed a lot of interest in hanging out again and got me stuff for Valentine's Day. We went on another double date on Valentine's Day (bowling and dinner) and it went well, but I kind of felt a bit disconnected from him and the next day when we texted, there was a definite lack of interest/chemistry.\n\n I'm guessing he felt it too because a day later, he texted me saying he really likes me but he's had a lot of bad relationship's and blah blah, basically he doesn't want a gf right now and he wants to keep it casual. I'm currently calling total BS on this because he put A LOT of effort into talking to me the past week and made lots of references to things we were going to do in the future, but after the second date, it kind of evaporated.\n\nDo you think he is BSing me or not?

My relationship isn't based entirely off looks, it's more-so based on personality of course. We've been dating for almost 2.5 years now, this is the 3rd time he's gotten a big hair cut that I disliked and I'm kinda annoyed to be totally honest. It seems like as soon as his hair is the length I love, the length he's adorable with, I get a week before he cuts it all off. And I KNOW. I know I know I know. It's his head, his hair, he gets to decide what happens. But that doesn't mean I have to like his haircut... \n\nSo I kinda ruined our night. We were gonna cuddle, watch a movie, have sex, but since I rejected him for sex (not in the mood....

Not sure how to respond.\nPOST: Backstory: Yesterday morning on my way to work, I got into a minor rear-end accident (fortunately no one was hurt). But sadly, it left the front of my cheap commuter car damaged to the point where it was not worth the cost of repair. \n\nIt wasn't too much to handle, and since my wife was at work for the day already, I decided not to tell her until she got home so as to not stress her out. \n\nWhen she got home (I took the rest of the day off) and I told her what happened, her first reaction was concern for my well-being and that felt good. However...\n\nAbout a half-hour later, I noticed that she was starting to text her parents about what happened. I asked her to hold on the text, since the dust was still settling, I was still processing what happened, and I did not feel comfortable letting anyone else we know (family/friends) what happened yet.\n\nThis was really hard for her to take--she told me she's an external processor and needs to talk to other people to work things through emotionally. That is a very core need for her, she said.\n\nThis is contradictory to my core need of feeling secure between the two of us as a couple, as a sanctuary from the world. To go and tell her parents less than a half-hour after I told her what happened, feels to me like a leak in an window. At least, I feel, give me a day or two to process things myself, between just the two of us, before we open it up to the world.\n\nWe're at a loss of how to resolve this between us. She feels resentful that she's giving in on her core need to process by talking things through with others, because I want her to wait a bit.\n\nAlso, she is mad at me for not telling her right after the accident happened and waiting instead until she got home.\n\nSo... how do I work with this? Am I expecting too much? I want to find balance.\n\nThanks for your perspective.\nTL;DR:"}

I think our relationship is pretty good - we are constantly saying we love each other, have fun together, hardly ever argue, and get on well with each other's family and friends. It even survived the last year of semi long distance. Early on, I think I knew this was the best relationship I have ever been in, and he seemed pretty keen too. In fact he was the one saying 'I love you' first and getting me involved in his family events at the beginning. We have talked about marriage from the beginning, but more in a jokey way.\n\nI have been asking him for a timeline for about a year and not getting any serious answer. Previously I dropped the subject after I got a jokey answer back, but now, I really want to know the answer. I just get a jokey 'shut up, haha' or he changes the subject.\n\nHe's in the process of moving in with me at the moment and we both have good, stable careers. There has possibly been a bit more external pressure recently, as my brother got married and I caught the bouquet. There was a lot of joking about us being next and my uncle even sat me down and asked if I knew where my relationship was going. \n\nThis am I told him seriously that we need to chat about this and does he even think that he would marry me at all, but he will not talk about this at all. I'm not sure how I can facilitate this conversation. Maybe he doesn't want to - I really hope not, but why won't he even discuss anything about it?\n\nHelp!\nTL;DR:"}

During this relationship things were good, until she started being online at weird times of the day, constantly saying she was busy etc. Which at first I didnt care about, but then it was all the time. Eventually I find out that she wasn't actually busy, she was just busy talking to other guys. To make things worse when I called her out on it the first time (when I was just suspecting things, before I had solid proof) she went crazy saying how could I question her love and saying that I have to trust her. Obviously this made things even more of a kick in the teeth when I really found out, that she got angry at me for questioning her loyalty, even tho she was indeed not being loyal. \n\nAnyway. My new GF who I love very much and am much more compatible with is starting to do the same odd things that my ex started doing to begin with. Ie making excuses to sound busy, yet seeing she is on facebook talking to someone the whole time. So I asked why she was on FB when she said she had to go do something and that she would talk to me later and she said almost the exact same thing that my ex did (you have to trust me). Its like deja vu. But I know I've got trust issues(I've had an odd past, of being constantly let down and misled, outside of relationships too that gave me trust issues), and I know my judgement is clouded because I'm panicking to save myself from getting my heart broken again. \n\nI want to mention my current GF admitted to kissing another guy when she was with her Ex. Also that she leaves her phone around and I see this same guy sending her messages multiple times(I try to tell myself to relax and that its probably just a guy friend, but its hard). Which only adds fuel to the fire of panic in my head.\n\nI don't want to start questioning my GF's love for me and putting unnecessary strain on our relationship before its even begun.\nTL;DR:"}

The first six were spent in an open-relationship type situation \u2013 I was seeing other women and communicated this from the very beginning.  She said she was ok with it, but she didn't want to hear about it.  She's naturally monogamous but tolerated my dating.\n\nFor the past month or so, she's the only woman that I've been intimate with, by choice.  She knows this, and the dynamic of our relationship really changed for the better once she found out that I don't intend to see anyone else.  \n\nBut there's still an underlying friction from those first ~7 months.  She gets paranoid when I go out with my friends, and makes comments about me being a playboy or going out with another girl.  It's joking, but it's revealing.  She'll also say things like \"don't worry we can cancel, it's ok\" if I'm a few minutes late picking her up or meeting up with her.  Or \"It's ok, you can go see another girl.\"  Like she's afraid of being a problem.  \n\nIf we don't talk to each other for a couple days, she retreats emotionally.  I have to pull her back out and reassure her that I care about her, and really enjoy her company.  Then everything is golden.  \n\nThe need to constantly reassure her is draining though, especially with the ambiguity behind her wants and needs.

He only does it with his friends and in a social scene. He knows I am uncomfortable with him doing it yet he does it because he feels like he can control it.

I am not working, however, between school and other commitments, I have 60+ hours of commitments per week to deal with, before commuting. We've been married 5 years. I've been back at school for 4 months now. \n\nBecause I am not working, my husband is the sole breadwinner and he's taken on a lot to earn enough for us to live on. He's always working, so am I, and our schedules aren't matching up well. \n\nThe interaction we do have is usually really late at night when we both are home, and lately it's been really terse, and he's been kind of mean. I've been trying to nurture our marriage - I've been initiating sex more, trying to talk, but all I've been getting is short responses. He sometimes suggested (supposedly in jest) that I'm sleeping with people at my school, but I don't think he's saying it in a completely humorous way. I think, deep down, he suspects that I might be cheating (I'm there all day, everyday, for the most part). I am not cheating.\n\nThis is all compounded with the fact that one of my classmates IS actually making passes at me, but I've been trying to avoid him as much as humanly possible. I am going to be in all the same classes with him for the next 2 years, so I can't just avoid him forever. He knows I am married. He is attractive, but I am keeping him at arms length.\nTL;DR:"}

Our only problem is that while he seems committed now (insurance, bills, romantic intent) is that he can't foresee marriage in the near future. Fine, it's overrated. Even though I am university educated, I'm staying in a small town in a bad job so I can be near him (and because of this, I don't really have the finances to move). I'm fairly sure I want to be with him, but I feel so trapped by circumstance. So, resentment that he doesn't deserve.  To top it off, lately the sex has only been OK, and infrequent, and he's not taking great care of himself - bad food, no exercise, etc. This did not bother me a few years ago when we were young, but now we're growing up, and he has no real intentions of changing this.\n\nHere's the thing: there's this guy who comes into my incredibly boring job and totally makes my day.

Are comparisons inherently evil and destructive?\nPOST: This is something I'm struggling with. I'm an engineer, and I have a very empirical, rational way of decision making. My partner is the polar opposite, and is so heavily driven by emotions. So much of my career and my general being is defined by comparisons, such as comparing two binary conditions to determine the best possible path to follow. I don't see all comparisons as evil (now I know that comparing yourself to others is often considered a bad thing to do), but my boyfriend does. He believes he is his own person on his own journey and should not be compared to anything. We are incredibly divided on this issue, especially when it comes to him going back and finishing his degree. He wants to get into a specialized Masters program for therapy, and the simplest, most rational comparison such as your achievements being compared to a graduation checklist is something he disagrees with, or saying that his formal academic path (what classes he needs to take, what programs he should consider, what requirements would be) would be similar to what my friends and coworkers have taken infuriates him. \n\nI don't get it! I don't see any emotion in these comparisons. You want to get a Masters in Family Therapy? Then your academic track will be similar to my friend who just got a Masters in Family Therapy. Your story may be different, but the requirements you must fulfill to be licensed will be very similar. That can be a resource for achieving your own success, so why not use it? I guess I see things so black and white that it's become problematic. Like, if I am hungry, then I eat food. That condition is satisfied. I can now proceed. I don't think about how this food will make me feel, etc.\nTL;DR:"}

It's nothing glamorous but it pays more than it should and affords me a lot of downtime that I used to use to work on school work, and now use mainly to surf reddit. For now, I have weekends off, but it is a 24/7 operation and sometimes I can get called in to work overnight on weekends. Recently the company I work for has been acquired by another company and rumor is that my department will be liquidated.\n\nI also recently was offered a position as a letter carrier with USPS. It has always been my dream to be a letter carrier but from what I read its not quite the job it used to be. Regardless, the thought of working on my own, getting to walk around and be outside is appealing. Taking the USPS job, which is a 360 day contract with high potential to become a full time employee. The benefits in the long term if I become a full time employee could outweigh the initial drawbacks. The job also would be a $3+ an hour pay cut from what I make at my current job. The life at this job sounds very uncertain...it is part time but most carriers work 40+ hours a week, no set days off, often working 8+ days in a row.\n\nThe thing is, I have to accept the USPS job tomorrow, or I lose the offer. There is a meeting next week at my current job that will confirm whether I will continue to have a job here and for how long. The meeting could also be just a regular meeting and the rumor that my department will be consolidated will be just that, a rumor. \n\nDo I follow money and a job with 8 years seniority or take a chance and live the dream of carrying letters?

Of course this most definitely leads to conflicts. \n\nWell it did, I wont stress the content of the argument, but we did have one, she freaked out, I freaked out. First I have to mention that all this happened over a messenger, as it is a LDR we are having. So towards the end of the argument, it is getting late and she had to wake up early tomorrow. So we ended our fight and she was trying to make it good again. She was saying something like, we are more like friends (in Chinese), and I read it as \"lets just be friends\", as I was skimming through her messages and only picked up the keyword **friend**. So me, still in the heat of the fight said - \"yeah lets just be friends\". She was totally surprised and said she did not want this, but if I do, than she will go along. She then just said she was going to bed and ignored the rest. I did tell her I want to sort things out tomorrow, but I'm not sure how things will end.\n\nSo yeah I'm not sure how she will react tomorrow and whether I can fix this.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [40M] with [37F] after 4 years, she sleeps with someone while family member is dying\nPOST: About four years ago I was having a relationship long distance.  We were friends for many years, often vacationing together, and then we were more than just friends for four years straight.  We would travel to see each other but often we'd just be talking on the phone.  She would talk forever; I get bored after talking for an hour a day.  That was a sore spot with her. \n\nHer father was ill and as he deteriorated we saw less of each other.  I tried to be supportive by phone, offered to visit and help but she declined.  She has a conservative family and visiting at her parents house was really awkward for her.  Soon after her father passed my niece was diagnosed with terminal cancer with only months to live.  As my niece is deteriorating badly, she tells me she slept with someone else because we don't communicate enough.  I was (am) so mad at her for this. It's one thing to break it off but to drop that on me when my niece is dying is just infuriating.  It was a time I could have really used some emotional support.\n\nI stopped responding to her emails and calls.  She reached out to me a few times after my niece passed and I ignored her.  Almost 2 years past she sent me a long email mostly in the tone of lets forget that ever happened and I replied with a terse \"I don't want you in my life\" type response.  I get really mad at her every time I think of this whole mess and yet I also find myself thinking about her, the whole life we had, and how hard it is to start over.  I've dated others since but admittedly am not seeing anyone at the moment.\n\nOn one hand I feel I need to unburden myself with this hatred I have for her and should just forgive her.  On the other had, I can't help but think she abandoned me at a time when I was really unraveling watching a 9 year old succumb to cancer and any sort of forgiveness would be like betraying the love I have for my niece.  That probably doesn't sound rational but the breakup and the death of my niece are somehow hardwired together in my head emotionally.\nTL;DR:"}

We had seriously talked about the situation and both decided that we were ready and willing to try for a LDR. He was never one to really express feelings but two days ago he approached me saying he needed to talk about emotions. We talked about how hard it was to be apart, and how much we love and care for one another, and how, though we were young, we both wanted a future with each other. However, the conversation took a turn and he said it was to difficult to stay in the relationship at long distance. So it is over. We have both restated our love for each other but the break stays the same. I suppose my question is how do I deal with the relationship ending even though both of our feelings remain the same? How do you draw the lines, how the heck do you move on?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Feeling suspicious of my husband lately.\nPOST: I 28/f started getting suspicious of my husband 32/m after a fight about a month ago. \n\nA little back story. We have been married for 3 years. Throughout the 3 years we have fights on only one topic. Sex. Now. We are having sex but he wants to have sex more and/ or adventures and I'm not comfortable with the adventure he has discussed. He has a much higher sex drive than I. We have talked this one til we are blue in the face. It seems that the only compromise is that he learns to live with brining it down a little and I try to bring it up more . We even discussed open relationship and I couldn't handle the thought of it , although he seems as though he could. So a month ago we had the biggest fight about it in response to the open marriage discussion where I broke down and just said I didn't know what to do. \n\nSo now. I noticed a message from a girl on his Facebook (he handed me his phone knowing I was gonna message myself, no snooping) they next day I went to Facebook message a video from his phone and noticed the message had been deleted. It was the only one deleted. I also noticed her phone number on our phone bill and that a day he said he had Mexican food at home alone(I was out of town ) she made a comment that indicated she had eaten Mexican with him. \n\nI asked about the message and explained how I was feeling. . He told me he often deletes short messages as to declutter his inbox (which is a first because it's full of short messages back to like 2012) and said he is sorry he made me feel that way. He didnt ask me who made me uncomfortable or what specifically were the things that made me uncomfortable. \n\nbecause the girl this is occurring around is a girl that is a very active member at the gym he owns I didn't wanna name names and create awkwardness there with him. \n\nI just want outside opinions on the situation. I have never questioned him being faithful in the past but I've never seen him talking with other girls like this in the past. So I thought I would ask what outsiders think of the situation .\nTL;DR:"}

The brother in question took a picture of the act and posted it to their fb wall.  My boyfriend took a screenshot of it and sent it to me.  I was horrified so I sent it to my friend who is in the sorority of the victim after she told me she'd heard there was a photo and had seen an anonymous post on Yik Yak (hard to explain) about it and now the brother is being investigated by the school for sexual assault (rightly) and being kicked out of the frat (rightly). \n\nWhen my friend asked me who took the screenshot, I truthfully told her it was my boyfriend. Now my boyfriend is afraid that his fraternity brother, who is extremely violent and absolutely crazy, is going to hurt him somehow and he is furious with me. He feels that I threw him under the bus (if I did, it was unintentional).  To add a little context, this isn't the first time he's felt that I've \"thrown him under the bus\"  but this situation is very different from the others.\n\nI don't know what to do. I've apologized over and over and he replies that he's too stressed for the apologies to even register.  He won't look at me or touch me.  I love him so much and it is destroying me.\nTL;DR:"}

He's been there for me purely as a friend for most of this, listening to a lot of my problems, giving me advice. He was one of my most trusted friends.\n\nRecently, I broke up with my ex. Not long after this happened we got intoxicated and confessed our attraction. We slept together shortly after and continued to do so for a few weeks. We never had a conversation about the boundaries or expectations of our relationship. I just assumed it was casual.\n\nAfter about a month or so he stopped replying to messages, if I went to visit him like I usually did he wouldn't answer. We work together, and would only speak if I went out of my way to do so. I kind of felt like I was wasting my time so just resigned our relationship to friendship and got on with my business.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks of this, we end up meeting at an event and talking about what had happened. He has chronic pain and had been on medication during this period, and he explained that this was why he acted the way he did. We slept together again.\n\nSo the problem is, during the 2 weeks we weren't talking, I went on holiday, got drunk and slept with someone else. Nothing serious, just bad decision making. Of course I told my FWB, but it wasn't until after we'd slept together and he was furious. He now wants absolutely nothing to do with me. I understand why and I feel shit for making him feel this way. We just had no definitions as to what was happening and I thought our 'thing' had naturally run its course. \n\nSo my questions- was I terrible for acting the way I did? Do you think our friendship is repairable?\nTL;DR:"}

Potential problem is i forgot to mention the word 'date' and its a slight possibility she took it the wrong way but i feel like its pretty obvious, especially since she was pretty enthusiastic about it.\n\nWell we met today and it started out a bit awkward, i had been advised many girls enjoy a hug at the beginning of a date so i went in for one, she didn't really return so it was an awkward half hug. I shrugged it off quickly and we went off talking about our days. We finally got to our destination (coffee shop) and went in. I was going to pay but she already had her money out and such so i didn't end up offering. We talked for about an hour and it was going pretty good. I had her laughing a bit and we just talked (although there were some awkward silences). Eventually she said she had to go about an hour later, (it seemed genuine, but i'm not sure) so i walked her to the train.\n\nAt the train she said goodbye, smiled and waved but no hug or kiss or anything physical. I thought she was having a fine time, but i'm not sure.\n\nShould i continue contact? should i text her telling her i had a good time and such?

We hit it off immediately (sidenote: we're both VERY quiet people, this leads to us being quiet together..is this bad? We're not used to each other enough for that). We get together a few more times after that, and I asked him out on a date. After the date (two weeks ago) we kept talking and randomly getting together. A friend of mine had mentioned to me that she was talking to some of his friends, he isn't looking for a girlfriend. I didn't mind this so much, but what bothered me was that if it was true, he wasn't honest to me.\n\nEarlier I got high (oops), just as he asked me why I get so nervous when we hang out (I am a very nervous and paranoid person). I unloaded on him. I said that I am afraid of getting hurt, because I know he isn't exactly serious about me. He said that he likes me but wants to take things slow. He doesn't want a girlfriend RIGHT NOW but likes me. I feel the exact same way, I understand where he's coming from. I can tell there's a difference, though. I don't know what.\n\nThe reason I posted is because while I am not looking for a relationship RIGHT NOW, I know that if I continue talking to this guy, at some point I will want something serious, and he may not be at that point.

My mother and I are very close. I even considered her to be a matron of honor before my FH and I decided to opt out of MoH and best man. I am the only girl in my family, the youngest, and the first to get married. So this is a big deal for everyone in our circle of family and friends. My mother has taken her role as mother of the bride very seriously. When we first went to look at venues she told me she \"has been planning this wedding for 23 years and its going to go her way\" I very quickly put her in her place (as awful as that sounds but I wanted to make it clear she cannot be controlling). But she didn't stop there. She fought with me on the shoes I wanted, the veil I wanted, along with a lot of other details. Thankfully everything has gone my way with approvals of ideas and things like that because we have gotten into a number of fights. Yesterday we were talking about my shower this upcoming weekend. I said my FH will be there towards the end to say hi to everyone and pack up the gifts. She said \"why? They have to come to my house.\" I was like...what? She said my father wants to see what I get...I told her they are gifts for my FH and my new home and life together. They go to my house and if my father wants to see them he can see them at the house. She honestly thinks I shouldnt even think about using them until after we are married. That's not happening. But what has really upset me, and im trying my best to get over it, is she is throwing her own party the same night of my bachelorette party next weekend. She invited a ton of her friends over for food and drinks and movies. My girls and I are staying overnight at a hotel having food and drinks and watching movies. I just can't seem to get over that it feels like she is drawing attention to herself to make it about her, at least in her friends eyes. I feel so selfish thinking about this because every decision about the wedding has been made by my FH and I together.\nTL;DR:"}

We came to that realization today, and I just can't hide my disappointment with being unable to go forward with my holiday plans.\n\nI've also had trouble hiding my stress in general, and broke down crying after a failed day of trying to get his prescriptions filled and him being in extreme pain. I've not dealt well with his pain responses (yelling out, cussing a lot, etc... nothing unusual, it just really gets to me).\n\nI know it's not his fault but I'm beginning to feel a pretty big grudge against him right now, and so I feel like I'm just being a shitty caretaker and being very selfish.

He also seems to never forgive my mistakes and never forgets them, constantly bringing them up.\n\nAfter my therapist implied the relationship was unhealthy/abusive I got to thinking. Today I took an online quiz (so accurate right?) and apparently if the score was 26-60 then it was highly probable that it was toxic. Brother got a score of 40.\n\nHe's only physically hurt me 2-3 times (not badly at all whatsoever). If you want details ask but really they were probably situations in which I merited them.\n\nI do feel guilty because when I was younger I was very bossy and rude towards him, but I also feel bad because I haven't been like that in years and he seems to still resent that although he's never said it outright.

Since then I've always hovered any where from around 185-215lbs at 5'10''. On my 26th birthday I decided to make the change and am currently around 155lb. I still got some body fat I'd like to get rid of but that's what 2014 is for. So when I went home for the holidays I got a hold of some old friends to go out drinking and catch up. This girl that I've had a crush on since I was... about 14 asked if I could give her a ride because she had had a few drinks with her family. I pick her up and she just keeps going on about how good I look these days. As we're drinking she lays it on me \"You know, I had a really big crush on you in high school...\" My jaw dropped. \"WHAT?! Wait.. I had a HUUGE crush on you. I was pining! I thought you knew that! Why didn't you say anything?!?\"  She says \"I knew you liked me. That's why I bought you a spiderman watch for your birthday that one year! That was my way of telling you I cared about you\" Well no shit. It seems so obvious now (it was a bad ass watch) but I was an oblivious fat kid back then. One thing led to another, took her home, and you know the rest. Thanks /r/loseit I don't think I'd be in this position without you!\nTL;DR:"}

So whenever I have cravings I vigorously lick my gums and the inside of lip. Anyways back to the story, as I was looking down, as yu may have guessed I had a craving, but this was the strongest one yet. So I licked my gums eXtra hard. By the time she had walked closer to me, I looked up and she shot me a small smile. I want to reciprocate the gesture, so I tried to smile, but as I smiled my tongue came out of my mouth and it appeared to look like I was creeply licking my lips as I smiled.

And she doesn't like my last name. \n\nMy reasoning: I'm the only son my dad had. Of course I want to pass on my last name.

But at the same time, I don't want her hanging out with sexy guys alone either, lol! And on top of that, my GF is bisexual, so would that mean that she can't hang out with anyone alone, lmao? The whole reason this came up is because there is a girl at my work that I became friends with (who is attractive) has been hitting me up sometimes to hang out. My GF doesn't want this single attractive woman to hang out with me by myself, but that would mean she can't hang out with her guy friend from work who has a GF too, right?\nTL;DR:"}

This is my second post on this subreddit. While they cover similar themes, I'm not going to file this under an update.\n\nI'm currently a junior student at a college. Throughout my life, I dealt with confidence issues and difficulty socializing. I don't have any strong friends and have never even dated. And now that I'm in college, I feel completely invisible. Nobody initiates anything in my life. \n\nDuring this weekend, I kind of broke down to some online friends. None of them seemed that willing to help, or interested whenever or not I'd stay or leave. I went swimming for 2 hours to relieve tension. It really helped, and I felt more talkative.\n\nBut here is the cruel scenario. Without my confidence, I was essentially ignored. If I am able to make progress with my confidence, it would just prove that no one gives a shit about the pathetic. And if people without any kind of confidence can't find even basic forms of love...*I will be completely and utterly apathetic*. Happier, but secretly thinking people as subhuman, only there for my pleasure and pass the time.\n\nI don't want to change like this. I just want to be me and be loved. Not even on a romantic level! Just someone who cares, and would miss me when I'm gone. Should I try to stay closer to me, or throw the towel?

We both wanted to build a solid foundation before we got married (Decent jobs, a place to live, the basics) since we saw so many people rush into marriages that didn't work out fresh out of school. \n\n  Fast forward to January of this year, we both have good paying jobs, had a nice place to live, basically had met our goals that we had set and were still going strong. We of course had our ups and downs, but at the end of the day I thought that our love would conquer all. I had started saving a couple hundred dollars from each paycheck and put in a safe with an empty ring box, and was going to propose on her birthday which is at the end of November. \n\n  I guess she got tired of waiting, since I found out two months ago that she had been cheating on me with one of her co workers for 6 months. I confronted her and she denied all of it, even after I showed her the proof. I broke things off, went no contact, but even now 2 months later I can't stop thinking about her. The part that I can't seem to let go of is that I was ready to start a family and spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n  I just don't know what to do, I lost my best friend, my confidant, my lover of almost 1/3rd of my entire time on this planet. Things aren't the same without her. I have lost all self-confidence, and have begun isolating myself from the few friends that I still have, have stopped going to social functions out of fear of seeing her out with someone and becoming even more depressed. I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. Any advice would be much appreciated,\nTL;DR:"}

He wants to have a future together, despite the iissues in our relationship. \n\n  \nThe problem is me. I am am extremely negative person. I have a supernatural ability to find something wrong with even the most perfect situations. And it has been really effecting our relationship. I am very good with finances, and instead of helping him with his problems (my original intent), I end up criticizing him and telling him how wrong he is with his decisions. He is more than capable of taking care of himself... so I don't know why I do this.  \n\n  \nI could go on and on with examples of me criticizing him for just about any thought or opinion or action of his. It's not healthy for either one of us, BUT I don't know how to stop. I want to be a healthy supportive girlfriend. I want to give back to him the love and support that he selflessly gives to me. Instead I show him hatefulness and toxic words... for no reason. I don't know why I say the things I sat and I don't know how to fix my toxicity in our relationship.

However, a month ago she broke up with me citing \"personal issues\" as the reason. Two weeks later though we got back together and we were as happy we used to be. However a few days after we got back together she began becoming... Distant. I tried holding her hand and she yelled at me telling me not to touch her. I chalked it up to hormones because it was her time of the month. However, she continued this policy and I'm not even allowed to hug her anymore. And yesterday she started enforcing a no kissing rule. So there is basically no contact at all anymore. She says she loves me but with all this I'm starting to doubt it. Oh and I should also mention that she barely carries a conversation with me anymore. It's mostly short one word responses. How should I handle this, Internet?\nTL;DR:"}

We met our senior year of high school and dated for a year and a half, before I suddenly stopped feeling what I used to feel before about our relationship. I tried going to therapy and just getting through it but nothing worked and after a few months I had to end the relationship. \n\nSince then, which was a year ago, my life hasn't improved. I've realized that maybe our breakup wasn't about her, because I've also stopped enjoying most other things in life. Now, I think my decision to break up was clouded by depression. Depression may have made me stop enjoying our time together and also my time with my friends and family. However, the difficulty is in knowing if my depression stemmed FROM my relationship problems or if it CAUSED them. \n\nMy goal now is to see a psychiatrist, hopefully be treated for depression, and be able to get in a healthy state of mind. I'm so afraid that if I'm healthy and want to try again with her, that I'll realize that our problems were real and not just because of depression and that I'll have to break up with her again. Despite our break up, we still talk and she is very important to me, so the idea of having to go through another break up and yet again being the cause of that and hurting her sounds awful. But, I'm afraid that if I don't try at all then maybe I'll have lost out on somebody who was really, really good for me, because she is truly special. \n\nI hope anybody here might have some experience with this or just general advice to give.\nTL;DR:"}

Also important to keep in mind is that the CO2 cartridge that came with the device was still producing, but obviously running low.\n\nThere are warnings over virtually every soda stream bottle and all over the box for the SodaStream warning you not to put the flavoring in before you carbonate the water.  However, I was in a hurry to get to work and absentmindedly did that exact thing.  I realized what I had done before I carbonated the water, but I thought, \"hey it's like 2 tsp. of water flavoring, not soda syrup, this should be fine.\"  \n\nI placed the bottle on the carbonator, locked it in place, pressed down the button to carbonate.  Usually once it gets close to full there is a whistle.  This time there was no whistle so I thought maybe it was because the carbonator was old and running out of CO2.  So once it got to 5 \"water drops,\"  I stopped and gave it one or two more seconds of CO2 for good measure.  \n\nAs soon as I pulled the bottle out away from the sodastream which unlocks the bottle from it.  The bottle shot away from the SodaStream, with my hand under it, crushing my fingers against the granite counter-top and bukkake'd about 7/8th of a litre of raspberry flavored sparkling water all over me, and everything that happened to be within a 10 foot radius of where I stood.  This included the mail for the day, my clothes where I was prepared to go to work, and underneath the upper cabinets.  \n\nI was already running late for work and this was made worse by the sudden need to clean the kitchen and myself before leaving.

I loved her when we broke up, and I still love her now, but I know we weren't right for each other, so I decided to break up with her at the start of summer so we'd have time to get over the relationship before our third year of university started. I didn't want to break up at the start of term and have the situation mess up our last (and most important) year of university.\n\nabout half way through summer, I found out she's been acting very out of character since the break up and has been sleeping around a lot which is **completely** out of character for her. She's been saying some weird things and copying other peoples strange opinions. The thoughts of her going home with random guys she meets in clubs and from the internet worries me. I don't want someone to hurt her.\n\nIn regards to the sleeping around, If she was like this before our relationship I wouldn't think much of it, but she never even used to even kiss people in clubs before me (and prior to her ex-ex-boyfriends.) \n\nIt's been about a month since term has started and she's made it clear to me she's moved on from the few times we've spoken. This is why I don't understand why she ignores me and gets so visibly uncomfortable around me. I genuinely want her to be happy in university and life, but all she's done has been nasty and disrespectful to me (example, getting involved with one of my old friends).\nTL;DR:"}

As we couldn't think of any redeeming shows or qualities these shows had other than as a showcase for people to avoid in life and to not look up to as role models.\n\nBut we did keep talking about it and found a few shows that we would consider *safe* for viewing. Among that list were the following\n\n* *Mike Rowe's Dirty Jobs*\n* *Deadliest Catch*\n* *American Pickers*\n* there were a few more but I can't remember them right now\n\nIn thinking about these shows we tried to find shows that didn't focus on the drama but rather the substance of the lives being focused on and avoided shows that were reality Game shows (*Survivor*, *The Apprentice*). Though in later seasons of *Deadliest Catch* the BS drama whining does get a bit over the top.\n\nSo keeping all that in mind, pick apart what I said or please give me feedback.

I met this girl at a party late last year.  We texted and facetimed all summer long, and it seems like we have a lot in common and things seemed hopeful.  We got to school and I took her on a coffee date and we had a nice conversation.  I made her laugh a lot and it went well.  The next two days we meet up at frat parties and basically make out with each other the whole time.  We are both virgins and remaining abstinent so it didn't get completely sexual but it was passionate.  \n\nThe day after the second party i saw her and she was very stand off-ish and kind of awkward.  The next day she told me that we didn't have the chemistry that she thought we would and says we should just be friends.  I handled it maturely and said thanks for being honest, but honestly I was pretty bummed out.  We talked it over a little bit.  She said she felt pressured to have feelings all at once, we jumped into things too early. I think she just got kinda scared. The day after that she tells me that she thought over it, and that it wasn't right to end things so quickly, and that she thinks I'm a great guy and wants to get to know me more before we jump into things, but just as a friend for now.  \n\nShe is still interested in me, I can tell. But I'm very unsure with how to go about things now.  She's in one of my classes and I see her then.  How should I go about this? We both take dating pretty seriously, and neither of us have been in a relationship.  How slow should i take it? How often should I ask her to hang out? Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

Her husband was always a sweet guy, a little arrogant but helpful and rational. However, when she got pregnant, he began arguing with her about little stuff and being really inconsiderate.  Now that the baby is here he is not helpful and is still super argumentative. \n\nLast week while she was holding the baby he started shouting at her about dirty dishes. She went upstairs to get away from him but he followed her up there. She put the baby down and he continued to shout and get in her face. She put her hands on his chest to keep some distance between them and then he shoved her to the floor. I am in shock. I never would have believed that he was capable of this but it's true. I know that he is also verbally abusive to her because their arguments are quite nasty.\n\nMy sister has told me that she thinks she might be becoming depressed. My sister has never battled depression before. I can't stand to see her like this but I don't know what to do. I want to have someone beat her husband up, honestly. My mom always told me and my sister that if a man ever hit us we should leave him ASAP. But I know this is easier said than done. \n\nIf anyone has any advice I would *really* appreciate it. I Know that counseling is an option but both of them are doctors doing their residency so their schedules are super crazy and they haven't found/made time for it.

They have a 3 month old baby :-( Please please please help. Thank you all in advance. I can provide more details if necessary.\nTL;DR:"}

Also, this is my first post, so bear with me.\n\nThe group of friends I ate with at lunch were a funny bunch of guys. One of them, who also happened to have a thick accent, came up with a funny word that made everyone laugh when he said it in a specific context. The running joke was funny to everyone for about two days, but he kept saying it the following days for about a week. To humor him, I was the only one who continued to laugh at the joke. Finally, after a week, someone in the group asked why I still laughed at it. I didn't want to hurt the guys feelings, so I came up with the first thing that came to mind other than just to humor him; his accent. He did not take it well; he started tearing up. Meanwhile, I'm feeling awful and everyone is now pissed at me. I figured telling the truth would just make matters worse, so I ended up sitting by myself for the lunch period after they told me to leave. I apologized the next day and still never told him the truth to this day.\n\nI later decided not to associate with that group any longer and hung out with a much more friendly bunch.

First time was really great, I remember thinking to myself \"That's the kind of girl I want to be with\". And she looked interested at first too. We met several times after it, but she looked less enthusiastic and it took me a lot of time to convince her to go out with me. Last time I tried to act confident and lightly kissed her on lips and said that I want to have relationships with her. She said that she need to think about it and that she still likes the guy who dumped her a year ago and hope to fix things with him. Well, that was polite rejection. After that she never agreed to meet me or agreed and then cancelled plans. But we continue to talk. I have a feeling that it may be unhealthy, but I like to message with her.\nTL;DR:"}

I asked her what happened, and she told me that she was really drunk when she left the bar, and when she got home she puked a bunch and fell asleep in the bathroom. She was really upset and thought I was going to break up with her, but I assured her that I wasn't going to break up with her and that if I was upset, it was only because I was worried about her and didn't know what happened.\n\nNow this next part is what really got to me, somehow while talking to her the next day, the subject of flirting with people to get free drinks came up, and I asked her semi-jokingly if she flirted with guys the night before to get free drinks. Her answer was a meek \"yeah.\" For some reason this got to me, I mean we had been dating about 6 months at that point, and I considered our relationship pretty serious. We told eachother that we loved one another and the works.\n\nShe assured me that she only did it for the drinks and wasn't actually flirting with any guys to start anything, and ended up denying the guys at the end of the night. But still, it hurt me a lot. I'm not sure if I should be hurt about it or not, but I was. Eventually I got over it, but tonight the thought came back into my head. \n\nIs this something that is normal to be upset about, or am I being really clingy?\nTL;DR:"}

I tried going no contact and staying away but I can't. We still are spending time together as if we are in a relationship. I love him more than I've loved anyone else and he tells me that he cares a lot for me, but just doesn't feel like he is ready to be in a serious relationship ( thoughts about cheating etc.). I know that the right thing to do is to say good riddance and walk away, but I can't bring myself to do it. He asked me to give him a couple weeks to figure things out, but I'm scared that when I do that I will still end up hurt in the end.

My phone has a software bug which causes it to restart when I try to do that. I tried to work around this bug, which caused my phone to restart every time I tried to send a text message. I went to the bell store for a fix, and they offered me a \"deal\" for a smartphone on a 3 year contract. A repair to my current phone was not mentioned. Since this was a small software issue, I thought this would be an easy fix.\n\nSpeaking to tech support by phone, they told me a repair would be $70 and take 4-6 weeks. I asked how to reset the phone, but I don't recall being told how. I was transferred to retention, where I was offered 2 other \"deals\" involving an extension on my contract (with a new phone) or buy a $50 phone from solo for the last 6 months of my contract (and they would \"generously\" waive the activation fee). I mentioned I was not happy with solo (reception, and this problem) and was told this model is a lemon, and it wasn't solo's fault.\n\nI found the manual online. I knew if I could find a way to delete all of my text messages, this would solve the problem. I found this explanation in the manual, and it solved my problem. I was right about this being an easy fix.\nNote: A phone on a 2 year contract has a warranty of 1 year. Also, the person at retention noticed an agent erroneously extended my contract last august.

A couple years ago I met my friend Brett [26 M] and we got pretty close. We both had a lot in common and I was excited to have him as a friend. About a year after that he met this girl Susan [23 F] and they became good friends. Shortly after that, he ended up kind of hooking me up with her. So far, so good.\n\nThe problem is, now I am with Susan, and Brett is closer to her than he is to me! I'm actually kind of jealous and annoyed but not in the usual way. I'm friend-jealous! For instance, when he wants to hang out, most of the time he will text her first and then she will invite me along afterwards. I almost don't want to hang out with him anymore. Just to be clear, I think there's near zero chance of anything weird going on between them, I just don't like \"sharing\" my friend.\n\nI feel somewhat ridiculous about this, because I don't feel like anyone has done anything wrong. For me, it's just no fun being friends with a guy who's so close to my girlfriend. I can't have a \"guy's night out\" because he always invites her, and even if he doesn't I can't talk about my relationship with her. I've had friends drift away before and that can be painful but I'm ok with that. But this situation, while not the end of the world, just constantly annoys me.\n\nI don't feel like I can talk to my friend or my girlfriend about this without it being weird. In fact, I kind of feel like a petty dick that I just can't let this go. It's just a really weird situation for me, because I've been in a lot of relationships and I've never had anything like this happen before. I'm curious if anyone else has experienced anything like this or has some advice on how to handle it.\nTL;DR:"}

When I first learned that the guy said that to her, my gf told me that she couldn't remember when it happened. But I learned yesterday that he texted that to her the same day I first asked. So she lied about when it happened for what seems like no reason. I told her that I felt uncomfortable with her texting someone who's intentions are have sex with her. But she doesn't see anything wrong with it and made me look really bad. She insists that he is just a friend and only wants to be friends with her (which I think is ludacrous). She says they text for a couple of days once every month or so and he lives in another city so they never see each other. He also thought that my gf and I were broken up when he said he wanted to have sex with her. She doesn't see anything wrong with a friend wanting to have sex with her.

First year went really well, and about halfway into our second year of the relationship I felt it was too serious, and I wasn't ready to match the commitment she was willing to make towards me. An example was her trying to plan a trip somewhere in Asia 2 years in the future with me; I didn't want to make such plans because hey, I was 21 and don't want to feel pressure from a relationship, I have lots of good things going on anyways with friends and school. We took a break and were on and off for 1 month, and then I fully ended it. 6 months later she came back to me and we began seeing each other and having sex. This has been going on for a while now. She has been traveling for the past 3 months and will be coming back very shortly.\n\nWhen she gets back there is no doubt that we will fall into our usual groove of things together. My problem is, if I want to stop seeing her, I will not be able to see her anymore as a friend, she can't do that. I enjoy her presence too much to fully cut ties though... At the same time however, I don't feel this strong attraction or emotion towards her anymore. \n\nI can't choose whether to keep going how we have been the 6 months before she left, or to completely get her out of my life.

I'm also willing to consider Electrical Engineering for my Major, or Network Administration/Other computer stuff for my Major, as those three areas are essentially what I'm interested at this point in time.\n\nI get along well enough with my sister, though I've never really met her husband (though I've heard we're pretty like-minded people), so I'm not even sure if this will simply drive me to get out as quickly as possible from there as well (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). I would like to be out living away from family, even if I had room mates down the line for a period of time.\n\nIs it worth moving out of Michigan (where I currently live) in a few years into Alaska?\nTL;DR:"}

This girl has it all the body, brains, personality, and genuine caring atitiude you look for in a girlfriend,did I mention shes a personal trainer, so she even has the brawn that I require as well. It was love at first sight we completely clicked, and I found myself desperately searching where she was when she wasn't beside me. This was supposed to spring break vacation. But I caught feelings hard, as did she!  \nWe both bond over working out which is fine, I absolutely love that about her, but and honestly I feel this is the only but in this relationship. She trains exes and/ or trains with exes who take her videos or photos. We both live in Canada but are miles away, exactly a 7 hour flight unfortunately regardless though I plan on visiting her next month. I know what all my friends and co-workers are saying ( HEY MAN WAKE UP THIS WONT WORK) but something in my heart and intuition tells me she is the one. Is this possible to make this  work and do you think its possible to suppress this jealous feelings of all these muscle bound dudes, some of them exes and or sexual partners, spotting and taking pictures of my girl friend.\n\nAlso we pretty much are in contact through facetime throughout the day so, No I don't believe she is cheating but I cant help but feel some sort of way. any help redditors would be greatly appreciated!!\nTL;DR:"}

We live in different continents. We went from PMing to emailing to Skyping nearly everyday. We decided to be exclusive about a month in. About 3-4 months in, we had a discussion about working towards something more serious and real, and he said he didn't want to commit to something he isn't 100% sure that it'd work out (because of the distance). He also said he has very strong feelings for me and could totally see himself falling in love with me, but he isn't yet. I was very much in love with him at that point and was getting way too attached and invested to not have any kind of security. I thought long and hard about whether to continue this or not. In the end, I decided to just enjoy what we have for what it is.\n\nFast forward to now-- we are generally very happy with each other. He says his feelings for me have gotten stronger. He adds that with all the things going on in his life right now, he can't even think beyond next week, much less how a long-distance relationship would work out. This has also made planning a visit difficult. We have tentative plans to meet in the summer, but it's not very certain. As far as eventually ending up in the same place, it would have to be him moving to my country, and I'm not sure if I can see him doing that. \n\nSo we've been just continuing this... thing. I am really, really happy with him, but I am also starting to feel pessimistic about where we are headed. This is difficult me to grasp because I'm a very confident and persevering person who finds very few things in life daunting. I told him about how I feel, and he said he doesn't want to give up on what we have or what we could be. OK... well, I feel like I will end up getting hurt. At the same time, we are so happy with each other that it's very hard for me to just walk away from this. What to do?\nTL;DR:"}

I'll summarize rather than go into extensive detail. \n\nI met a girl over the summer who was at the tail end of a four year long rocky, partly long-distance relationship. We worked together, spent buttloads of time together, and inevitably fell for each other. \n\nEventually, she broke up with the bf, and was hesitant to jump into a new relationship so soon. She said that she really cared about me, and that she didn't want me to just be the \"rebound guy.\" She said she needed time to herself to grieve the relationship and whatnot, but instead of cutting off contact at this point, I stuck around and acted normally. Instead of taking time to herself, she made our relationship official to appease me (it was something I had been asking for). \n\nAbout two weeks ago, while the hurricane in New York obligatorily separated us (she's in Manhattan, I'm in Brooklyn), she ended up telling me that she was feeling overwhelmed with the loss of power and whatnot, and that she wanted the time to herself that she hadn't received in the first place. \n\nI know what you're thinking, but I don't believe I was just the shoulder to cry on--I believe these feelings are legitimate, and the optimist in me thinks it will work out. As of now, I'm playing the no contact card and doing some grieving myself. We both love each other, and she promises that we'll eventually get back together, but she warns that she can't give me a timeline as to when that will happen. \n\nI know what you'll say--that I should continue no contact, move on, and give up on her. I firmly believe that this girl will play a role in my future. She keeps saying that she's sorry for having to do this, but needs to be single for a bit. \n\nAm I crazy for thinking there's a chance this will work out? Right now, I feel devastated, but holding on to a shred of hope.\nTL;DR:"}

However, I was out of love with my ex for a while and discovered he was cheating on me so I was ready to move on long before the relationship actually ended. My current bf was always a little sketched out it hadn't been long and even now when we fight he always mentions that I wasn't out of a relationship long enough to have enough perspective and blah blah.\n\nHe has two significant exes. One that he dated in high school for 5 years. First everything. She was around when his mom died so there's some weird nostalgia there he's mentioned. The other one was in college for 8 months and she kissed another guy so they broke up. He says that relationship isn't significant compared to the first and ours but I can tell it affected him. \n\nHe once told me he looks up his exes on facebook about once a month just out of curiosity. I thought this was very weird but he insisted it really isn't. Ok now this is where I'm bad. I've searched through his internet history maybe 4-5 times in the relationship. I know I need to stop. It's really comes from my own insecurities. I only found out my ex was cheating from looking at his history or else I never would've known in a million years. Well every time I've checked both his exes are in the history about 2 times a month. He usually looks at about 7-8 of their pictures. Something about this just doesn't feel right to me. \n\nReddit, is this normal? What could the implications of this be?

Thanks to the magic of iMessage/Facebook read receipts, I know they've seen my messages. Sure enough, I've been back in the city where we all live over a week and despite asking to join in on whatever they're doing at a given time, I've not been invited anywhere despite a lukewarm \"We should totally get together sometime!\" on the part of one.

She's struggled with being over weight (part of it to bad eating habits, which have been forcefully fixed due to health issues, though she's still a bit over weight). However, she won't take her diabetic meds. She won't take her birth control (I'm not sure why). And she won't take her antidepressants. \n\nThat leads us up to now. I'm in a whole other state, and she's been texting me that she's struggling with her depression, that she's been cutting again. I've told her that she could move with me if she thinks it'll help, despite the strain I know it'll put on me and my boyfriend (neither of us really get along with her) but I don't know what good it'll do? She refuses to do anything to help herself - no counseling, no meds, no exercises to help with the weight if that's what will help her confidence. At this point, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I've tried talking to her and that doesn't seem to do well. I guess it doesn't help much when I'm awkward and very uncomfortable with people upset, but I do try, because I've been there before. \n\nI just...help? What do I say to her? Is there someone I can call who can help?\nTL;DR:"}

(also, woo first post here)\n\nBack in first grade, my teacher had a little thing where if you still had a certain amount of these point cards by Friday (when you got in trouble you lost a card), you could choose a toy out of a prize box. Of course, me being the innocent kid I was, I never had a week I didn't get anything. I got lots of things, like a Wario plush, Yoshi figure (you seein' a theme here?), and some other fancy stuff. Well, one day I got a little Diesel figure from that old Thomas the Tank Engine movie (which is still a pretty quality movie imo). I also had an old Hot Wheels ramp on hand (don't remember when I got it).\n\nDo you see where this is going?\n\nOne day, I was sitting in my room, screwing around with the Diesel. I then had a \"bright\" idea. I grabbed the old ramp, plopped Diesel in it, looked over at my brother (who was doing who knows what), and exclaimed \"Watch this!\" and used the ramp to fling Diesel into the air.\n\nI watched as he did somersaults, all the way into the globe on the ceiling fan. I heard an ear-wrenching shattering sound, and watched as hot shards of glass fell everywhere. I'm surprised none hit me. My brother wasn't so lucky, though. Once the glass quit falling, I looked over, and saw he had a large cut on his knee (it wasn't deep), and I think he had a small cut on his face. My parents came running into the room, and I explained what happened. Needless to say, I lost the track ramp to the trash can, but kept the Diesel for some reason (probably because it wasn't in my hand, or by me for that matter).\nTL;DR:"}

When we started dating she told me about this friend of hers who she met last year and went on a couple of dates with. Now I'm always very sceptical about girls who have guys as their best friend, but she assured me that they were just friends and that they just stopped seeing each other because it didn't work out.\n\nI subsequently got concrete evidence that this is a lie. She used to write on her Twitter and blog about how much she loved this guy when they were dating, and she had been sleeping with him during the Summer. The reason they stopped dating is because he didn't want her, yet she always talks about him. She swore to my face that she hadn't slept with him when I asked her 6 months ago, even though I asked in a very reasonable and non-accusatory way.\n\nI'm very worried about this. She speaks to this guy virtually every day by text, and has gone out with him for drinks alone on at least one occasion that I know about.\n\nI honestly don't think she would cheat on me with this guy, but I feel betrayed on an emotional level. I might be old fashioned, but I personally think you shouldn't stay close friends with someone you used to have a sexual relationship with when you have a new BF or GF, and had I known the truth from the beginning I wouldn't have entered into this relationship.\n\nI don't know how to bring this up, but I can't go on like this.

No problem. I got it installed, started the car, then next thing I know water is spraying me once the car got to temp. Find out that the part I needed to replace was the plastic piece the thermostat plugs into. The dealership had the part I needed but they wanted too much for it. So we found one online for literally half the price and ordered same day delivery. It was supposed to show up today sometime.\n\nThe part was supposed to be delivered to my parents house some time before 9pm but everyone who lives there is working early. I stop by about an hour ago to see if it was dropped off and sure enough there was a UPS sticker on the door saying that the package was dropped off in the office.

I get there before the driver even puts the package in and grab it from them and rush over to put the part in before I had to leave for work.\n\nI finally get upstairs to their apartment to examine my merchandise only to realize it has my brother's name on it.

I mean it's every 5 minutes unless they're on the computer, which they spend probably 8 hours a day on. My dad doesn't see anything wrong with their computer time and gets very stressed out from breaking up their arguments. He won't put them in therapy or anything, no matter how many times I ask he says he doesn't have the money. Since I basically helped raise them, I'm still somewhat of a mother figure. That leaves me to deal with their fighting as well. They also do anything to get attention (ie: making annoying noises, chanting, etc). They have to be corrected 24/7 and it's exhausting.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even like being around them because I hate listening to them fight. I love them but I find I'd rather be alone in my room at this point. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

See: \n\nI have been sober ever since my arrest and I am hoping the DMV approves that my risk is not as high as a denial would be needed.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [OH] Bought a home- heat pump incorrectly installed and ruined- $8K cost to fix. Any recourse?\nPOST: I bought a home in December 2015 (live in OHIO if that matters). The home was purchased and flipped by the seller. I had general inspection, mold inspection, radon inspection and wood destroying insect inspection completed. I did NOT get the HVAC system inspected. The house has a heat pump (new installed in 2015). The air handler/furnace was not new and was 19 years old. I expected that I would have to replace that at some point. House has coverage under a home warranty. \n\nAfter receiving electric bills for $450 each (far more than expected for a house of this size) I had an energy audit completed. House has been air sealed and had insulation added. This did not bring down my bills. I then had 2 different HVAC companies come to check out the system and make sure it was working correctly. \n\nFirst guy was sent by home warranty people. He said that the pressure was off (sorry I don't understand how any of this works- all magic to me) and that it was caused by an obstruction at the time of installation. Due to this the home warranty people have denied my claim. I called a second guy for a second opinion. He said there is no obstruction but that the people had installed \"the wrong kind of heat pump which does not match the furnace\" and that the system has \"two different kinds of refrigerant.\" He further explained that in doing so they have ruined the new heat pump and that will also need to be replaced now at a cost of ~$8K.\n\nMy questions is this: do I have any recourse to get the seller and/or installer to fix this on their own dime? My thinking is that once I signed off on the house it was mine along with any issues or preexisting problems which were not detected at the time of purchase. However, I have zero understanding of any of this and am wondering if I should seek legal advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I never ever approached a girl I don't know with the intent of dating, hence the reason my ex girlfriend was my only girlfriend, and it was she who approached me.\n\nSo I gathered the courage and went up to her and introduced myself, it took balls of steel for me and I was super nervous. It was a bit awkward but I think it went well. She also told me she had noticed me, but told me she didn't like 1 night things, and I assured her that was not what it was about.

Later that night, she asked me to sit next to her, and I did, she then laid her head on my shoulder, because she was tired, and a little later she hold my hand for a little bit. I kissed her cheek and her forehead a few times.\n\nThen we left the party, and before me leaving, I gave her a note with my number on it, hoping that she would text me if she was interested in me.

Due to circumstances beyond their control, the project that they'd each spent thousands of dollars and hours on has officially gone bust. \n\nWith their backs against the wall, they've approached me with an offer to expropriate my 'neglected' website.

Since English is not his first (or even his second) language and he is a theoretical physicist I feel lucky that he is as verbally expressive as he is.

Since he is not going to go out and read every book and article about depression and having a depressed partner I need to sort of guide him through this.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is mostly (I think) a reactive depression due to multiple external stressors, not just something that is happening to me out of the blue.  Most of the issues in my life have nothing to do with my partner or our relationship (family, health, and work-related, mostly), but some do.  I don't really want to work on that relationship stuff with him right now because I am unable to distinguish what are \"real\" problems and what only seem like problems when perceived through the depression.

I pushed the coffee cup back a little and put my laptop on the table. My  computer was still hanging off the table a little bit so I pushed it back, forgetting about the coffee behind it. The coffee tips over and spills onto this girl's Macbook Pro. I thought it just got on the flat part and didn't do any damage. She got upset obviously and wiped it off with her sleeve. I said sorry and didn't think there was anything else I could do about it.\n\nToday in class I overheard her talking. Someone asked her how her computer was, and she said she brought it to a place to get looked at. She said it cost her $80 USD just for the diagnosis, and the results said something about the hard drive being fucked (but the $80 would go towards the repair costs. I have no idea how much we are talking, but I'm guessing ballpark probably a few hundred dollars.)\n\nI was thinking about approaching her after class and telling her to just give me the receipts and I'll reimburse her for the costs to fix it, but I started thinking. After discussion with someone else, we decided that I shouldn't. I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure there is a \"no food/drink\" policy in the library, *especially*  at computer stations. It was *her* coffee that she put right next to her computer, so I think she should be responsible for the repair costs. She hasn't approached me about it, but I'm just wondering. What do you guys think?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [19/m] Confused about what happened between me and my best friend, with whom I am in love. [18/f]\nPOST: So for some background, I've known this girl for around three years, and have pretty much had feelings for her the entire time, but kinda forced them down and convinced myself they werent there for a majority of it, because she was dating a good friend of mine until around six months ago. I've had a couple of girlfriends during that time. My ex and I broke up around two months ago, and after a while it kind of started to come back up. \n\nSo, fast forward to around a week ago, she and I got kinda drunk and wound up having sex a few times. Afterwards (while sober), there was cuddling and talk about having feelings towards each other. Two days later, I went over in the morning, and we slept together for a few hours and had sex again, after which there was more laying and you get the idea. \n\nI was very happy, and she seemed to be too. We ate breakfast, and I took her to work. She kissed me goodbye and we were texting back and forth as we usually do, and from time to time there would be talk in a relatively romantic/flirtatious manner.\n\nAfter around 12 hours of sudden radio silence, she texts me saying she only wants to be friends and wants this to go no further. I don't get it though, because not 24 hours before that, she seemed to be very enthusiastic about it, and it wasn't just sexual considering the rest of our conversations. \n\nI told her that it was fine, but i'm actually really busted up about it. It was easier to deal with before, but now i've had a pretty thorough taste of how fucking happy that made me, which made it a lot harder. I don't really know what to do, what happened, or how to deal with it. Anyone got some advice??\nTL;DR:"}

I took her virginity and we both fell in love. Looking back, I fell harder than I should have because in the beginning I wasn't serious about the relationship. \n\nNow after three years, I am known by her grandparents, parents, and her siblings as (Her name here)'s husband. I never wanted to drag her through this and I feel like complete shit for doing it to her. She loves me way more than I love her and I don't know how to break up with her.\n\nI've tried to end it 3 times and they all resulted in both of us running back to the other crying and begging for forgiveness/another chance. Right now, things are rocky and we haven't spoken for 3 days. She just dropped off (On my front porch at 1 a.m.) what my little brother is calling a \"Care package\" including some notes I wrote her in my Sophomore year, my favorite candy, two cards she purchased and wrote books in, and my favorite stuffed animal from her house. All of this was along with a giant letter P that she made in art class with pictures of us throughout the years.\n\nLike I said, I know this is going to break her heart, but I've kind've already made a connection with an old friend and I'm just ready to move onto another part of my life being just finished with high school (She has another year).\n\nHow should I end this without making her family and friends hate me? Is there a way? Also what should I do about the dog WE purchased and is OURS?\nTL;DR:"}

Some days ago when I called her at night as usual and I asked her if she missed me but she told me that she didn't, that she was not just apathetic but unconcerned about the relationship, that she doesn't know what she wants and why it is happening to her but she still loves me. It was harsh and unexpected but I'm grateful for her honesty at least.\n\nThe next following days I felt awfully bad, I tried to avoid talking to her but she didn't even matter about it, then when I could not stand the silence anymore we discussed on the phone, she swore she is not looking for another guy, that is not about something she doesn't like about me, that probably we just lost the spark (I don't think so, but whatever...) but *she is not sure, she just doesn't feel the urge to see me like before*. So I tried to be strong and I told her that she if this what she want we will end the relationship asap and move along but then she broke down saying that she could not stand be without me, we could try but she can't assure that this solves her mind.\n\nI believe that is the sudden end of a great relationship, I don't know if it worth doing something because I think that she is in denial, I also guess she doesn't want to be alone and prefer to stay in the comfort zone, and If we manage to solve that, we are just delaying the unavoidable.

The pipe had burst that morning and I didn't understand why he couldn't let me know that sooner so I wasn't spending the day looking forward to it. I thought it was strange he didn't say happy birthday or anything and that he didn't let me know sooner about the pipe burst, having to work late, etc.\n\nI talked to a friend and decided I needed to end it with him because I was on the fence already. I called him and we had a pleasant convo in which he still didn't say happy birthday when I ended it. I didn't make it about that but said we weren't well matched. I don't think we had amazing chemistry. He said he was completely surprised by it and it came out of left field. I asked him why he didn't say happy birthday at least and he said \"I gave you a nice present and don't need to say it again.\" I apologized and thanked him for dinner again.

We've dated for about a year and half, and she still really loves me, and wants to keep it going by coming back in a few months for a week then coming back permanently late September at the earliest.\n\nHowever we have both accepted the realities and aren't still dating during this long distance period - ie we can be 'single' to an extent, but I don't really care about that right now.\n\nI loved her just as much, but am quickly feelings those feelings fade away because we can only really skype once a week / call each other a few times. It isn't anything remotely like the amount of physical time spent being around each other (we were housemates who started dating, so we've been living together the entirety of the time we've dated). We have basically discussed it and if we were to get back together, it would be for long term.\n\nAm I a shit person? It's not really the prospect of being single that is driving me, I have just found myself increasingly thinking about her less and less when we aren't communicating directly, and beginning to enjoy the 'singleness' that I am currently in.\n\nI really, really loved her up until she left (which was a really hard time for both of us), but now I feel the distance rapidly getting to me. I told her while we were skyping today that I was feeling the distance getting to me and felt that my feelings were waning and she was visibly upset about it.

[15/F] and [19/M] in a long distance relationship\nPOST: We met through Reddit in September last year. He lives about 300 miles away, I've never met him in person. In October I revealed to him that I had a crush on him. He said that he felt the same way but that he couldn't be in a relationship with me because of the age difference, and said that when I turned 16 we could be together. He turned 19 in February, and I turned 15 in March. He then asked me out on my birthday, 5th, so it's been about a month officially, but I count it as about 5 months from when I told him about my crush. Anyway. My parents know about the relationship, but they aren't too happy. They think of him as a paedophile and that he isn't normal because he has relationships with people 4 years younger than him, when in reality he's never really made any sexual advances, or pressured me into anything. He knows I'm not a virgin, and that I thoroughly regret losing my virginity. He treats me with the utmost respect, a true gentleman. We are making plans for him to come down and meet me in August, and for him to meet my parents, too. What I want to know is, is our relationship wrong and unhealthy? My parents really aren't happy about it, and they're dragging me down with them. He and I have skyped previously, so I know he isn't catfishing me or anything, but my parents are still suspicious. I am not planning on having a sexual relationship with him until I'm 16, which he is completely fine with. He has shown no signs of having bad intentions, and I'm pretty sure I can trust him. I guess I just want to be reassured that I'm not a freak and that this relationship is normal.\nTL;DR:"}

John and I were the only two to go to the same college. I've stayed close with several of the friends, but john has lost contact with all but me. \n\nEver since college, things have gotten worse for John. He's always been very socially awkward and different. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he was somewhere on the high functioning spectrum of the autism spectrum. After leaving high school, John has receded so far into his shell that I'm basically the only person he talks to or spends time with. When we do talk, it's mostly about how miserable he is. He's depressed, hates his job, hates his roommate, is lonely, is struggling in classes, etc etc. I've been offering constructive advice for a while (Can you try to find a different job? Would you want to speak to a school counselor? Are there any organizations that interest you? Why don't you hang out with me and my friends this weekend?) It's all to no avail. He refuses to help himself and comes up with excuses for why he can't do things. I'm at my wit's end. It's incredibly frustrating to listen to him talk about his problems and not try to fix them. He reaches out to me at least several times a week and the conversation always end up on his issues. \n\nI don't mean to completely under sell John. He is a nice guy, and we both have a sarcastic sense of humor that we get a kick out of. Sometimes we laugh about the old times, and he has some interesting, intelligent things to talk about. But the friendship feels one sided. Granted, I don't have any major issues to talk about, but it's always about his problems.

She was abandoned and had terrible separation anxiety, which she no longer has issues with. She has been a great dog. She is well behaved in the house, gentle, and very responsive.\n\nHowever, she still suffers from general anxiety and neurotic behavior. She will often exhibit obsessive behavior such as licking, \"nibbling\" on her blanket or bed, and barking. Sometimes she can work herself up to the point where she seems out of control; her heart rate gets high and she barks obsessively.\n\nI've learned to live with it and mitigate it as much as possible. I can rub her belly and speak softly to her and that helps. It also seems to help if I make her do some easy tricks like \"sit\" and \"lay down,\" it seems as if it helps her gain a little control over herself. I know this is generally frowned upon, but I experimented with a shock collar for barking. It actually seemed very helpful, she didn't seem frightened and it seemed to prevent her from working herself up into a frenzy. I was living in an apartment at that time and the barking was a major issue. I recently moved into the country so I haven't been using the collar. Exercise helps, but doesn't completely solve the problem. Her anxiety is at its worst at the dog park; she is much more comfortable around people than other dogs. About a year ago I rescued a second dog (a young pitbull), and that has helped her social anxiety a bit. The first few months were a little rough, but now they cuddle and groom each other regularly.\n\nOverall, she seems like a very happy dog, but I know the anxious episodes can't be fun for her. Now that she is getting older I worry about her heart, and to top it off she has a genetic heart murmur. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

Either standing or laying down for at least a week.\n* Stretch it out 4x a day.\n\nI go back next week for another adjustment but I'm not sure if I should make a chiropractor appointment or if this level of pain after is normal?\n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

There's never been an explicit discussion of \"do you want to have sex with me?\" from either one of us, we pretty much stop at calling each other cute. But I'm very conscious of him looking a me in certain ways, and things getting heated when we make out. I know there's probably nothing I can do about it, but for the most part I really don't want him to think about me sexually.\n\nIt's not that I don't find him attractive, and I do have a sex drive. There have definitely been times where I've been pretty turned on while we're together, just from kissing. But I'm not comfortable doing any more than that. Even thinking about one of us being shirtless makes me feel awkward and embarrassed. In my mind, I feel like I'm too young still to do sexual things, so it's possible I'm just not mature enough or something like that.\n\nI'm mostly fine with waiting until it comes up - this is both of our first relationship, so it's possible he feels similar. Either way it's not urgent, but I do worry about giving him the wrong impression or letting him expect or hope that sex is going to happen.\nTL;DR:"}

I invited one of my buddies from my high school to hang out in the city one day, and when he came down they realized he's going to the same school, they happen to have similar majors, he's got a similar taste in music as I, and he even has a similar personality to me.

Overall, he's a really great guy and I can definitely see myself being with him for a very long time. I'm his first girlfriend.\n\nI find that he often gets jealous of people when they talk to me, even when I don't initiate the conversations. On Twitter, for example, if I post a random tweet and some guy favourites it or comments, he's always asking who is this, how do you know him, did anything ever happen between you two? etc. Sometimes, he will even find something to make fun of this person for.\n\nToday, I accidentally sent a text that yeah \"yes I would\" to him and after I apologize and say it was meant for someone else, the first thing he does is go, \"who was that meant for?\" When I asked why it mattered, he asked why I was getting so defensive.\n\nSo basically, I have all these little red flags going up but I'm not too sure whether I'm overreacting just because of my past and he's just being a curious guy... or if he's being overly jealous and/or controlling.\n\nI've tried to explain to him that I don't really appreciate all the questions as they make me feel like I'm being interrogated, but he still asks me stuff like this all the time. \n\nHe knows my ex used to go through my texts, FB chats, emails, etc. and how violated that made me feel... and he says he would never do that. But the way he's reacting to some things reminds me of my ex and it makes me think that he may eventually end up going through my things. \n\nWhat do you think?\nTL;DR:"}

George and his family furnished the house to make it easier for George's roommates to live there without spending extra money. \n\nOne of the renters,  lets name him Greg,  was a bit unhappy with the living room seating arrangement. He changed it into what he though was a more appropriate television viewing seating arrangement without telling George. \n\nWhen George came back, he was a bit confused about the seating arrangement and asked Greg why he changed it. Instead of explaining that the couches were positioned to see the television better,  Greg blew up on George by saying \"This house is my house and I don't need your permission to do anything inside of it\" and stormed off. \n\nGeorge felt pretty upset by the comment, as it felt incredibly rude to him. George then asked me for advice on how to help him deal with Greg. \n\nAlthough the fight is pretty unimportant,  am I right to assume that Greg does in fact Not own any part of the house as he is just a renter? Should Greg be more willing to abide by George's rules since he is an extension to the family that owns the house?\nTL;DR:"}

Which, if accepted (I will know in 3-4 weeks), I will begin in January and the schools are both just 15 minutes away from my job.\n\nI made the decision to be honest with my boss about going to grad school from the beginning and he has been extremely supportive - he is probably one of my biggest supporters even when it comes to my personal life about this. And I've truly appreciated it.\n\nBut I am not sure if he expects me to remain full time or to leave the job. Personally, I would not be able to handle either of these situations. I would definitely like to stay at my job and do part time. Two other co-workers do part-time for personal and legitimate reasons. Yet I don't know my boss' opinion on this. Especially because he hasn't asked one question i.e. me going to school full-time or what my internship hours will look like.\nSo, really, what I'm asking is: if/when I'm accepted, how do I ask him to go part time at a 9-5 job? Do I offer taking less money? Do you think he'd let me go?\n\nP.S. When I eventually do my internship, I will need to leave my job. It is 100 hours/semester and then two semesters of 300 hours. It would just be impossible to do my specific job on top of interning and that will come up in about a year or so.\nTL;DR:"}

I like this person a lot. He's very kind and goodhearted. But I'm quickly realizing that he's more socially conservative than I thought.\n\nHe's very dedicated to and involved with his Christian (nondenominational? evangelical?) church, which I think is nice, but also very foreign to me. I'm suddenly feeling uncomfortable and worried that I won't be able to look past his views on certain social issues.\n\nI believe it may also end up being a problem for him that I am lacking in the faith department. I don't want this to ruin what I think could otherwise be a really great thing.\n\nMe? I was raised Catholic and was actually very involved with my church as a child and adolescent. The church's views on social issues, especially homosexuality, left a sour taste in my mouth and I chose not to get confirmed.\n\nPersonally, I am still seeking religion. I haven't lost my faith entirely, but I question the existence of God more often than not. Most of my friends are athiests, no doubt due to the way most religions view them (they are gay). So my social circle really only offers more skepticism.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

She invited me over to her place for the first time and I ended up staying the night. From the looks of it, things seemed to have taken off really well. However, by week three she decided to give me the \"Let's be Friends\" speech via text which included her informing me that she came to the realization that it wasn't working between us over the duration of a single weekend. She also included in her text that if I needed anything that she would be there. \n\nMiraculously, I have taken the news with a positive stride and walked away from this without falling into a pit of depression and sorrow. However, over the course of the week that I haven't contacted her I have come up with some questions that I need help with.\n\n1) What is the true meaning to the phrase \"Let's be Friends\"? I have always been puzzled by this phrase. If she did not want anything to do with me, why did she bother including that phrase and basically tease me with any hopeful thoughts. Wouldn't it be more efficient to be direct and cut contact entirely? Is this just a method to make someone feel better about themselves?\n\n2) Why would she also tell me if I needed anything that she is there for me? We are no longer in a relationship, we are nothing but acquaintances so why bother telling me that. She is not obliged to help me and frankly, I am not either.\n\n3) I accept the fact that nothing will come about between us. However, I have lost contact with a lot of really great women in the past just because I was either too afraid or had a large sense of pride to continue seeing that person as \"friends\". Would it be pathetic on my behalf to continue seeing her even though something went on previously between us?\nTL;DR:"}

I need a third-party opinion!\nPOST: **Please let me know if this post is better suited for another sub!**\nI am 26 years old and own a duplex, rent out one side and live in the other side. I purchased the duplex in 2013, have had three sets of tenants since, and now my husband and I are ready to hit the road for 12 months (while working remotely).\n\nWe have always thought we would keep this property forever but now we are having second thoughts. I purchased it for 385k in 2013 30yr/FHA, refinanced to a 15 yr/conventional back in June. I still owe roughly 330K. The monthly mortgage is $2300 and some change plus taxes and insurance bringing the monthly costs to around $2800. Our property taxes went up significantly this past year so we are looking at $5000 in property taxes and then about $1,200 in home owners insurance. If we were to move and head out on the road full time we would pull in around $1,000k in income from renting out both sides. After accounting for property taxes + home owners insurance we wouldn't be netting much each month. Oh, and there is income tax. Duh. So lets say we make around $300 a month in rent after all is said and done.\n\nWe can potentially make around 150k - 200k by selling the property and moving on. We remodeled each side of the duplex upon moving in so it's in much better shape than it was two years ago. Much better. \n\nLet me know if I left out any information and please point out what I a missing in terms of keeping of the property forever. \n\n<p>Numbers broken down:\n- Monthly mortgage: $2,336 \n- Current rent for other side: $1,800\n- Potential rent for the side I live in: $1,600\n- Annual property tax per month: $416\n- Homeowners Insurance per month: $100\n- Maintenance per month: This varies from $100 a month to $8k (depends on what goes wrong that month)</p>\nTL;DR:"}

Only thing is, it turns out that when you are starting class in the military, you have to first fill out a forum asking for permission to begin a degree program, THEN fill out a different forum right before class starts to get approved for tuition assistance. I figured they were both part of the first process and didn't look into it further until my school asked for the tuition assistance letter. Went to get it and it informed me that I needed to start the tuition assistance paperwork prior to starting the class. The school I'm going to has a scholarship that would have covered most of the remaining cost, but it requires me to have tuition assistance.

He felt better, was going to the gym every other day, and looked amazing. Our sex life improved dramatically because he had more energy and I was more sexually attracted to him (I know this is sad, but it's how it works. He knows I'll always love him whether he's 200 or 600 lbs.). \n\nSchool started getting stressful, and this past semester/summer, he's gained most of the weight back. He's told me that he hates when he looks in the mirror and feels like a mass of fat when he sits. It broke my heart when he told me that.\n\n**The problems are this:**\n1. He's very stubborn. He won't log food on myfitnesspal, he won't do cardio, and he won't eat vegetables. This makes it hard for him to lose weight fast. \n2. He is very VERY busy and very stressed. Going to the gym for an hour is simply out of the question.\n\nI have no idea how to help him, and I feel sad and helpless when I see him hate his body. I want to help him make a change, but he lacks the motivation when stressed, as other issues take priority. I know his motivation needs to come from within him, and not from me, but I want to make it as easy as possible for him to lose the weight. \n\n**Is it possible to lose weight with HIIT, maybe 20 min a day? What's an easy-to-stick-to, quick workout/eating plan that he can do?**\n\n**Also, how can I best support him without being a nagging girlfriend?**\n\nThank you so much for all your help.\nTL;DR:"}

Talking to people hasn't been high up on my list of things to do in my free time. This also goes for dating. I've only ever been in one relationship, 4 years ago, it lasted all of a month, and ended with her cheating on me. Probably didn't do much for my self-esteem but that's not what this is about.\n\nRecently I've been trying to throw myself into situations that would encourage me to interact with people.\n\nI met a girl on a popular dating site about a week ago and we've been messaging pretty regularly on facebook. We seem to have similar interests, hobbies, blah blah blah. But I have a problem... I feel like whenever someone that piques my interest gives me any attention, I feel like I start getting overly attached and get extremely critical of myself. I've been trying to avoid doing this by just not talking to her. (it's been a day since I talked to her... so not that long) I don't know if that's really the best solution, but it's what I could think of. Right now, I'm just holding out to see if she takes the initiative. I don't want to seem clingy by always initiating conversation.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My wife [33 F] has been secretly messaging her neurologist after brain surgery, and lied to me [33 M] when I confronted her about it.\nPOST: This is a throw-away account for obvious reasons. \n\nOkay, I will try to keep this as unbiased as possible by sticking to the facts, and momentarily leaving aside my feelings. \n\nSome time ago, my wife  had a health scare. After an MRI scan, neurologists discovered a growth. In the end, thank goodness, all worked out fine after brain surgery. However, at the time, we were terrified it was cancer and we went through quite an emotional time. I feel I did my best to look after her and support her through this.\n\nFlash forward some months later, and this morning (Sunday) when I went over the other side of the room to kiss my wife, I saw that she was on Viber. I asked who she chatting to, and she told me it was her female friend. The thing is, I spotted that it was a guy's name when I glanced at the phone on the bed. When I told her, she insisted I was mistaken. I told her I was sure it was a guy's name, and at that point she had to admit it was.\n\nTo my utter surprise, it turns out she has been in regular, secret contact with the young neurologist who treated her. He gave her his personal number, and they have been chatting a lot since the ordeal, and in a rather friendly way too (talking about films etc.). When I asked if they had slept together, she denied it, and I have no way of knowing whether this is true or not. When I asked why she didn't tell me about it, she became defensive and said that she was afraid that I would overreact, and accuse her of having an affair. \n\nSo here's my question, and I would honestly like impartial advice on this: Who is being unreasonable here? Is it me for assuming that this relationship she is having is somewhat suspicious, and inappropriate? Or is it her (and the neurologist) for having a relationship of this kind without my knowledge?\n\nThank you all in advance for your help. Regards.\nTL;DR:"}

My friends who used to be together 24/7 are now awkwardly splitting down the middle and I feel like a fifth wheel.  My only real friends throughout elementary school were Chad [13 M] and Sarah [14 F].  We've been through a ton of terrible stuff together, including many family deaths, Sarah's parents divorce, Chad's two cats both dying, etc.  We were always a tight threesome and we thought nothing would ever change that. \n\nThat's when junior high came along.  Over the course of two years, our little threesome became five.  We bonded with Joey [14 M] and Lily [14 F], and everything was fine.  There was an awkward situation in eighth grade where Chad asked out Sarah and she said no, but that resolved itself within a few weeks and it was like nothing had ever happened.  Other than that, nothing of importance really happened\n\nThen high school screwed everything up.  The first semester was going fine, and then Chad asked Sarah out again.  He said he had \"never gotten over her\" (not true) and she said she would love to go out with him (she didn't love it).  When they broke up, Lily got pissed at Chad, to the point of leaving any group chat that even mentioned his name.  It wasn't even a bad breakup; if anything, Chad and Sarah are closer friends than they were before.  Their friends made them choose, and now Chad only hangs out with Joey, and Sarah is only with Lily.  Whenever I tag along with either pair, I feel like the third wheel.  I'm left out of inside jokes, I'm the one they don't give headphones to, etc.  Chad, the person who was once my best friend, refused to even say why he couldn't come to my birthday party, and got super apprehensive when I asked again later.    What do I do?  Is this a way to save these relationships?  Should I just look for new friends and ditch Sarah and Chad?\nTL;DR:"}

I went NC over 2 months ago and still feel like I don't always fully register it all. This person I was so close to, and thought myself in love with, for two years did not exist at all. Literally everything I \"knew\" about him was a lie -he even lied about things as trivial as his \"dislike\" of a certain pasta sauce I like, just to mess with my head that tiny bit more... His bigger lies included his job and his \"cancer\". It's mind-boggling and really difficult to fully wrap my head around. I still catch myself remembering him as someone I knew and loved, I can't seem to fully cognize the fact that every aspect of his personality was deliberately contrived to appeal to me. There's also the fact that he had been attempting to cheat on me since we first met, and is now currently very happy with the one girl he was eventually able to successfully cheat with I really can't tell if I'm dealing with it properly -I'm an introvert, and trust/strong emotional connection never came easy for me even before I was cheated on and manipulated by this guy I wholeheartedly loved and trusted. I've recently entered a fwb-type situation with a guy whom I've realized reminds me of my ex in both physical appearance and mannerisms (though as far as I know, he has no personality disorders). Since realizing this I'm wondering if his similarity to my ex is, on a subconscious level, the reason I've become involved with him. I'm young, single, and reasonably attractive in a city I love. I dodged a huge bullet, and came out of this safe and physically unharmed. I should be relieved, grateful, happy -and I am. However I'm also just very frustrated and confused, with a fair amount of resentment and anger. It's jarring to realize how easily he was able to manipulate me, and I'm worried that all of this will negatively impact my ability to have healthy relationships in the future.\nTL;DR:"}

It wasn't an argument, but it really hurt my feelings.

He admitted he used to (back when he would hangout with them a lot, so maybe 7-8 months ago). He doesn't really hangout with anyone except me nowadays (his choice, not mine), but I already had my assumptions that he would talk about attractive gils with his friends when they would hangout. You know, the usual, 'oh that girl is cute' etc.\n\nShould I be as hurt as I am about this? I feel like I'm overthinking this and shouldn't let it get to me so much.

I disputed this and mentioned the previous payoff.  They then closed my account without payment from my part (this letter came from the VP of operations)\n\nFast-forward to this week and ANOTHER collection agency is hitting me up for the cash.  I decide to contact PayPal directly (i had done so in the past, but they never had a collections division and couldn't help with the outstanding balance).

I met my friend five years ago at a summer retreat, we hit it off pretty quickly and we've been close ever since, despite the physical distance between us, we even shared a flat for a while before circumstances changed.\n\nThe past few years have not been easy on me, but my friend stood by me at every step, and within the last year I've found myself falling for her. I am not super confident and tend to shy away from confrontation when possible so I have not yet confessed my feelings, but I am finding this incredibly difficult.\n\nMore recently she's met someone, and that's totally fine, I just wonder if it would be selfish to confess feelings now, in light of this relationship.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Getting back with Ex-Girlfriend, should I give her money to help her career?\nPOST: My (M 33) ex (F 30) is an anthropologist and lives in a different country from me. Recently we have started getting back together and I would like to support her trip as part of her phd studies to go and live somewhere else for 5 months to do her research. She needs a sum of money to do this which is equivalent to 1 month's pay for me and I have the money already saved up and ready to go. However, she really feels strongly about financial matters and often has been against me supporting her (although this was more in a long-term situation). It was a bone of contention when we were seeing each other previously. \n\nI would simply like to send her the money but I am  worried that a) she will be upset about me giving her the money and that b) it might change the good dynamic we have getting back together. I broke up with her previously and I want to do something nice for her and I also want to show I support her in her studies which was something we argued about before because she returned to her home country to study and we were then apart. If I mention that I want to give her the money she might feel obliged to say 'no' but perhaps she will accept it if I explain my reasons. The money is not really a substantial amount for me at all but would make a big difference in her life so their is defo an imbalance in a few ways with this gift.\nTL;DR:"}

Tonight is the first night were not talking and at different parties.\nPOST: Little back story. We dated for two years and she broke up with me a month ago today. She was perfect for me in every way possible.\n\nWe met randomly at a festival in my home town. I was walking with my friends and then these pretty girls come up and talk to us. There was this one brunette. Second I saw her, I knew she was going to be mine. My friend called dibs on some other chick and I had no problem. \n\nShe was perfect. She was funny, incredibly smart, extremely beautiful, so much fun to be around, and to top it all off, we just clicked. We never talked but we talked like we've been for years. \n\nNo one got me like her, so naturally, we became best friends. I never had a girlfriend before her. She never had a relationship past 4 months before me. My friends have never seen me so happy. We were the first people we had sex with, so there's that connection. And we had a pretty deep connection. Things started to change back in august/September. One thing led to another, and she broke up with me exactly one month ago. Enough back story. \n\nShe wants to take a break because she feels she has changed and wants to get back to how she was. I haven't doubts. Like if that's the actual reason but she's always been trustworthy , so I can't really question it, but I can still have my doubts. But the thing is she wants to try again in the future. Well I didn't like where our current relationship was heading. It was heading towards a open relationship and I don't want that so I stopped talking to her a and cut her out of my life... Almost. We still have each other in snapchat. \n\nTonight is the first night that we are out and not talking to each other. My biggest fear is her being with another guy and it so hard knowing that this could be happening right now or happened.\nTL;DR:"}

Should I break-up?\nPOST: Me and my gf have a really great relationship since the beginning. When we met we started dating almost immediately, as you would call \"love at first sight\". It was very intense emotionally on the first year. We trust each other, we support each other and we like to laugh together. We're basically best friends on top of being romantically together for 2 years. I think she's very beautiful, caring and energetic.\n\nBut things started changing since we moved out of our country. I got a job on another country, and she came to live with me. She's still unemployed. Before we just lived separately on our respective parents house.\n\nNow I'm more and more craving for my own time. I miss being alone. I started fantasizing being with other women, and the boring routine is settling in. I wake up some mornings thinking if we should be together, and if I'm happy being with her. I'm not sure I am. Sometimes I feel really lucky that I have someone like her, and sometimes I think that maybe she's not the one.\n\nI don't know if these thoughts are normal, but there's absolutely no reason why I think I should feel this way. She is still the same person: beautiful, caring and energetic. And our relationship should be getting stronger because we're sharing a new experience of living together.\n\nOf course this has been affecting our relationship for the last months. She noticed something was wrong, and we had a huge talk about it. I couldn't explain to her what I was feeling, but I basically told her that things aren't what they used to be.\nTL;DR:"}

Her previous relationship ended suddenly and painfully for her. Our friendship became stronger, and we became closer over a couple months. Started dating, everything  going really well. I was worried about the idea of just being a \"rebound\", so I didn't rush into things, making sure she knew what she wanted.\n\nThings were going really well, until she suddenly had a shift in attitude, saying \"I'm getting too attached to you\", \"This is too deep, the way I'm feeling\", and \"I don't know if I can let that happen\".\n\nI can think this thing to death, but I could really use some outside perspective.\nI sent her some messages that night stating my position on the matter, but it seems to me she isn't quite over her last boyfriend, or fears getting attached due to the risk of losing it again (?)\nShe says she read and thought about what I said, but left it at that, so now I'm in the dark about what she's thinking. She is still communicating, so she hasn't shut me out... but her text style is noticeably different.\n\nI told her that, when she's ready, I want to get together and talk about what happened... just struggling to keep my mind off of it at the moment. \nShould I leave her alone until she contacts me, or should I try to set a time with her to have a discussion?

She just needs the normal amount of attention that any human being needs, but I just can't handle it right now. I know it's selfish, and I'm aware of that, but I just don't want to deal with the relationship. Maybe it's because it has an expiration date? I've been struggling with anxiety and depression, so maybe that's affecting it too.  \n\nAnyway, I just don't know what to do. I care about her. A lot.

My dad wanted me to do football in order to make friends and stay in shape, so I went to a few practices and found out that I really hated it and would not want to do it full time (I now live in Texas so Football takes up a whole class period plus before and after school practices). So in order to get out I just biked up to the school and told the councilor to take me out of football and I quit that day. I never told my dad so while he thought I was at practice I was really just biking around the community/driving to friends houses. Fast forward 2 years, I just became a senior and my dad finally asked if he could go to a game, that was last week, he didn't see me play and asked so I said I was 3rd string and didn't get to play much. He got pissed and called the coach to complain, who then told him that he didn't know who I was and that I wasn't on the team.

Is it normal?\nPOST: Sometime ago, I realized I only was interested in dating guys who share my ethnicity (Indian) but who were also raised in the US like me. I don't think it was ever a conscious decision but maybe more out of the convenience of sharing a similar background? Even though I'm pretty aware that people who share my same values exist in all ethnicities.\n\nI actually feel really uncomfortable hanging out with groups of Indian people. My friends generally have diverse backgrounds and I really enjoy being around a mix of different people. Somehow though, all the guys I end up being into are South Asian. So it's been hard to reconcile why I have this attraction with who I like hanging out with normally. This is not to say it's a purely physical thing because a good looking guy of any race will be a good looking guy. I just can't imagine dating anyone else especially in the long term. There really are no external factors like family pressure either because my parents are cool with whoever as long as I am happy and treated well. \n\nIt's also hard for me to meet Indian guys since I don't really have other Indian friends and for some reason the community (especially on college campuses) seem to all know each other. Having moved to a new place recently, it's been hard finding a new in. \n\n I'd like to find some way to either move past this attraction or hear your opinions on what I should do and whether it is normal/acceptable to be only into one ethnicity.\nTL;DR:"}

We went out for dinner in the city, then to see a Broadway play, and then had a few beers at this awesome beer bar we discovered on the way home. I had made her a Mix Tape of silly Broadway tunes to go along with the theme of the evening, don't judge me for being corny!

I asked her if she'd like to hang out again this weekend, which was met with complete and total silence.\n\nSo reddit, my question is... what went wrong? Did I wait too long to contact her?

Says I pushed him away\nPOST: I'm a complete wreck right now and I honestly don't know what I'm looking for here. I guess an outside opinion.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now, and things have gone relatively well. The issue is that I have severe self esteem issues, and lately I've been snapping/ taking it out on him. We were planning on moving in together and, being my paranoid self, told him during an argument that the only reason he wanted to live with me was so he could save money on rent. So anyway, the time came to sign the lease and he told me he couldn't go with me, that I had to get there ( an area I had never driven to) by myself. This was annoying, but not earth shattering, and I 'got an attitude' apparently when I asked him to call and talk me through how to get there. \n\nSo after that argument we haven't really talked for a good 10 days, and today I'd had enough and pretty much told him to let me know what was going on/ what he wanted. He responded basically that my attitude and neediness ( for needing directions) had pushed him away.  He said that he had his own life and couldn't be expected to drop everything And come save me because I couldn't get around in an area I was trying to live in. In the end he basically said that 'damage was done' and he didn't know if it could be fixed, which is why he was ignoring me.  \n\nLike I said, I don't know what mind of sense can be made of this, but I'm hoping someone out there can help me out\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/jobs\nTITLE: Should I take this potential job?\nPOST: Hi Reddit,\n\nJust asking for some friendly advice. I'm 22, I was recently called in for an interview for a web developer position at a local company. Great right? Here's my dilemma.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I left my web developer position at a different company locally, for several reasons. One, I hated the work environment, it was quite restricive, no opportunities to improve myself, and it was almost soul sucking. Second, I didn't want to be a web developer. I originally took a program at college to be a 3D Artist, and I still want to do that. I'm currently just learning new skills and building my portfolio, but I'm not ready quite yet. \n\nWhile I was working, I was working two jobs, and I still have the second. It's just delivering pizza, it keeps my rent and bills paid. It's part time at nights.\n\nNow of course, I haven't got it yet and I might not, but I am more than qualified for this particular position, so I feel confident about it. So let's assume for now that I did get it. In order for me to still work towards becoming a 3D Artist, I will have to quit my second job. This will completely screw my boss there over, who has become a good friend of mine, and my coworkers too, who are all friends I grew up with. Now this doesn't mean I can't quit ever, just right now would be non ideal. (He is very short staffed and has terrible luck finding good workers)\n\nIf I keep both jobs, I won't have time trying to build my personal portfolio, delaying me becoming a 3D Artist, as I will have to balance two jobs, my girlfriend and friends. And I absolutely don't want to get stuck as a web developer.\n\nEssentially, I would take this job for money. I don't NEED it, but it would help a huge amount, also, an easier, more balanced work schedule, food business at night doesn't really offer that lol.\n\nSo! That's my question and current dilemma, hope you can help me out.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not 100% sure if she likes me back as i am getting mixed signals. She tags me in things on facebook (and no one else) and snapchats me all the time. I always make her laugh and she get's pretty close to me when she drinks, like holds hands when we walk places and wants to be around me. She had a thing with another guy recently but has given that up because she isn't interested in him. She said she doesn't really want to hang out much with him if he still likes her, she would be weird around him.

So my 2nd attack would'nt have made a difference.\n\nShe was going to take a pic of me on my phone and post it on instagram to make me look bad but she also had no signal. Am I selfish or inconsiderate for wanting some me time while I was busy all day??\n\nI just wanted 3 minutes to myself but the dumb phones made me stay on them for a bit longer.\n\nI know I should've been holding my gf's hand but she wasn't that sick and was joking with me on the way to the hospital. But I am a good person and after the war was over. I spent the whole time with her and made her feel better.\nTL;DR:"}

Is it wrong of me to be upset?\nPOST: Okay so backstory:\n\nMy fiance has a 4 year old son whom she has Thursday-Sunday. I work Mon-Fri (8-5ish), she works Mon-Wed (11-730ish), but on Wednesdays she gets off early around 3pm. With her son with his dad Monday through Wednesday, we really only have those days to spend together. Since we both work until relatively late in the evening, we don't get very much time to spend alone together. Wednedays have become our sort of \"date night\" so to speak, or at least a night where we can actually enjoy more time with each other. Last night (Tuesday), she told me that she was going to the movies with her mom and sister Wednesday night at 8:30. This upset me because I had planned on taking her to see Mad Max (granted, I didn't tell her nor bought the tickets yet, wanted to surprise her) and it's our one night a week that we get. \n\nAny other day of the week I would have been fine with it. Spending time with family is important, I just wish it was another day, especially since she sees her mom and sister multiple times a week anyway. Is it wrong of me to be upset about this? I think I'm more upset at the lack of consideration, like it didn't even cross her mind that Wednesdays is the most we get to spend alone per week. I tend to over-analyze things, so that could be it too. What do you guys think?\nTL;DR:"}

At some point in the middle of 2012 I was 145kg (height 1.85m) and I couldn't run even if my life was depending on it. \n\nSuddenly, I decided to start doing some exercise, particularly running. At the beginning it was really cool, my knees where hurting but little by little I made some progress. \n\nI decided to take it seriously and I signed up for a 5k around November 2012. The 5k race lead to a 10k until I build up endurance to the extent of running (like really running) my first marathon last October. I was really happy. I achieved something! I was more or less fast and most importantly, I had a good \"normal\" weight, around 98kg. \n\nAfter that marathon I was feeling ready to start training for a triathlon or something like that. However, at the beginning of 2016 life got in my way. First, my girlfriend move to another country (which was really shitty), then I started writing my thesis, working a little bit harder and not exercising at all. I used to go for a 30 min run or to the gym, but suddenly doing exercise felt boring until I stopped completely. The result of this was me gaining a lot of weight (today I am 115kg).\n\nI went for a jog today, only 2 km, and I was feeling so heavy, slow and sad I had to sit down on a bench at the park and started sobbing, it was awful.\n\nDuring the whole process, lurking at this sub and reading about everyones achievements and stories has been really helpful to keep me interested in running. That's why I now turn to you guys and ask: Do you have an advice or anything that can help me get motivated again? Something that can help me enjoy running as I used to.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for 7 years, am I wrong for staying or will the fear I have pass given enough time?\nPOST: My fiance and I have been together for 7 and a half years and were supposed to get married this coming summer. We got together when we were teenagers and essentially grew up together. Starting roughly a month ago, she expressed concerns that we had only been sexually involved with each other, and no one else and wanted to consider opening up our relationship in order to explore our selves both sexually, spiritually, and personally. I did not feel comfortable with being in multiple romantic relationships, but I did agree that it was important to find our selves on an individual level. \n\nAbout a week went by and I noticed she was acting very different than her normal self. Over the following two weeks she slept with her friend four times, despite swearing to me that she had no feelings for him and that she would never cheat on me. She confessed this to a mutual friend and said was she going to end it with him as soon as possible, who in turn told me. I knew that I wanted to make things work, allowing her to have a second chance because I feel that she is worth having in my life, even if the pain was unbearable at the start. I kicked her out to her mother's house and forced her to make a decision on whether or not this was something she wanted or if she just felt like it was the right thing to do. Her conclusion is that our relationship is what she truly wants. \n\nI genuinely believe that she is remorseful, regretful of her choices and did not commit this transgression out of malice towards me, but out of a selfish desire of her own. I know that the healing process is very slow and delicate, and that maybe enough time hasn't passed yet, but I'm struggling to keep my self from constantly dwelling on the past instead of trying to look foward.\n\nWe are seeking help from a counselor, but in the meantime before the counseling begins, I need advice on how to take steps forward instead of backwards and how to remain focused on why I want this to work.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm about to graduate with a degree that I feel is now useless. I've always entertained the notion of going to art school, because I've been interested in product design/transportation design since I was a kid. I never pursued this because my parents were adamant that I enter a profession they deemed to be successful: law, medical, etc. Now that I'm about to graduate, I'm wondering if this would be an ideal time to pursue my long lost passion. What do you guys think? I know that it will take a lot of work and be expensive, but the prospect of landing my dream job is worth the risk.

Our school is pretty big in California so we decided to go their at night and film we got permission and everything. \n\nWe went there last week Wednesday at 8 pm and this is where the \"prank\" comes in. \n\nI was off doing something and I hear his friend yell \" emily come quick jack fell down the stairs\" I ran over and I see him lying there (he was pretending to be unconscious). I broke down I was crying, I was blubbering, I was screaming at his friends to call a ambulance, I kept begging for him to wake up. I thought he was seriously hurt and or paralysed  \n\nHe opened his eyes and got up like nothing ever happened and they were saying they were messing with me. I feel bad about it but I slapped Jack and I called him some nasty things and I stormed off. \n\nI love jack and I can't believe he would ever do that to me, I need an outside opinion is there any coming back from this because I don't even know any more\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Do I have have any recourse against my landlord?\nPOST: Been living at this apartment for a little over a year now, just resigned my lease with the landlord a month or so ago. Last night, SO and I found a huge growth of mold in a side room that is used for mostly storage purposes, though we also keep our liquor cabinet there. Now, we live in a garden-level apartment (AKA half of our living space is located in a former basement). Mold is on everything, to the point that some of our property is a total loss. Thankfully, our renters' insurance will cover some of the loss. \nHowever, after talking to the upstairs tenant, I discovered that the previous tenant in our apartment (who had been here for 10 years) had moved out due to severe mold growth. The landlords then \"replaced\" everything and redid the apartment. Upon signing the initial lease or recently resigning it, none of this was disclosed to us. I've never had problems with mold in the basements of past residencies so I wasn't necessarily expecting it here. There is nothing in the lease about liability for mold or loss of property beyond that the renter is required to have insurance (which we do). \nWhat, if anything, can we do about this? Is there a reasonable expectation for them to clean up this issue and resolve it completely?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [20/F] found out my bf [23/M] was cheating on me. He said he confessed everything, but I am still in doubt. Would it be wrong to contact the other woman over Face Book and ask for her side of the story?\nPOST: Alright, I'll try and keep this short and sweet. Bf and I have been together 2 years, and most of it has been distance. We broke up once, around our 1.5 year anniversary. There were many reasons, but one of which was because he was conflicted about feelings with another girl. When we were broken up, he slept with her. \nWe saw each other over break, and before agreeing to get back together with him, I asked that he tell me if he was unfaithful *not counting the break up.* I told him the only way I would take him back is if he told me everything then and there, so that we could both acknowledge what happened and move on. He said everything that happened was only during the break up.\n\nFast forward to this past weekend. We were both drunk, and it comes out that while we were definitely together before the break up, he fingered another girl. Things blew up, and I grilled him, demanding that he tell me everything. He was adamant that this last fact was all there was.\n\nHowever, I can't shake this doubt that maybe it really wasn't everything. It is killing me. All I want is to know the truth, if it turns out that he lied yet again, and that there is more to the story, I am leaving him. But all I have is his word. The only other option I see is trying to message this other girl on fb, and asking her for her side of the story. Now let me be clear, I am not going to bully her, cuss her out, or berate her. I plan on being as respectful as possible, and asking her if she would please tell me what happened between them.\n\nAll I want to know is.. is this a bad idea? Would this be crossing the line, seeing as we've never even met before? I know it is a difficult subject to bring up with a stranger, but would it be completely wrong to do so?

It seems like she is throwing away life and opportunities because she does have commitments like school and work, but she has been unemployed for 4 months already and total she was sent 1 job application. Also she is skipping classes and risking her school grant. It seems like she will barely pass her classes if she spends a great deal of effort starting now.\n\nI don't know how to deal with her doing that to herself. Specially since she requires  A LOT of attention and acknowledgement. It seems like if I don't give her attention or have sex with her. Her emotions plumber for days.\n\nAs for me, I keep my priorities in check and that sometimes means sometimes studying up until late. Because of this, if a few days pass and we don't have sex, she just sways away to her hole to watch netflix and tumblr for hours and hours.

I've always been very independent and have never imagined a future where I am being supported by someone else. My relationship with my family is neither close or negative. We keep our personal lives to ourselves and that is just what is normal for us.\n\nMy GF: She is currently living with parents, rent free, utility free, food available and ready when she comes home from her full-time work. I don't think she makes enough to completely support herself and is taking classes. She has a VERY LOVING and HEALTHY relationship with her parents. The complete opposite of mine and she is very lucky to have that.\n\nShe is not a dead-beat who leaches off her parents. She works very hard and has legitimate reasons (wage not enough and goes to school) to still live at home.\n\nBUT, even with all that, I still feel bothered. She doesn't need to pay rent/insurance/bills, everything goes to her and her social life. I've suggested to her to switch PT work and focus on school so she can finish faster but she says doesn't want to. By the time she finishes her degree and is able to START her actual career, she will be into her 30's.\n\nWhen I asked about her living situation, she says she doesn't need to move out and doesn't plan to anytime soon. I feel that she is too comfortable with her situation right now and takes for granted that time is a resource that you can't get back. I come over often since I live far away for my job and she still lives in my hometown. That means I stay over quite often at her parents house which makes me feel like I am overstaying my welcome (traditional asian parents)\n\nI feel like an ass because she has legitimate reasons to stay, but I just can't get over that feeling.\n\nAm I just over-reacting?\nTL;DR:"}

I was single for a while and my previous relationship was horrible so I feel like this could be really good and healing for me.\n\nMy only issue is he brought up sex the other day. He said something like \"have you thought about sex at all?\" and I just said I hadn't thought about it yet and we agreed that it would be best to wait until we know each other better & are more comfortable. The thing is I've never had sex before (I didn't tell him that yet, didn't seem relevant) so I don't know how long it will take for me to feel comfortable and \"ready\" to lose it to him. I feel like this could be a problem for him, considering the slight age gap. I know he's had sex before and he's a lot more experienced than I am, so it's probably normal for him to have sex fairly early on in a relationship. Which is honestly pretty intimidating to me.\n\nI've asked some of my friends and they all have different opinions - some say that if he's a good guy and he really likes me he'll wait as long as it takes, others say it's unfair for me to expect a 20 year old guy to not have sex until I'm ready.

I've now started a new degree (yay, debt!) and I'm meeting lots of new people. Over the last 2 weeks, I just don't feel that I'm 'in love' with her anymore, although I certainly have strong positive emotions towards her. She will often talk about getting engaged and I nod along but deep down I'm not that enthusiastic. I feel like I could be stringing her along with the promise of future marriage and sleep-walking into a future break-up that would be even more painful. \n\nOver the last few years, I've had periods where I've thought about breaking up. I feel bad for saying it but mainly because I'm not as attracted to her as I am some other people (I have a bit of a crush on someone - I've not cheated though). Since 18, I've become much more confident so I feel like I can aim higher - again, not a nice thing to think but I do. She's also been my only real relationship so I feel like I'm missing out on important life-experiences. \n\nWe get on really well although argue sometimes. Thinking over the last 6 years, I have amazing memories and she's been so nice to me. It makes me very sad to think I might never see her again. I know that if I break up it will be painful for me and an absolute heartbreaker for her. \nI don't feel like this is a sudden thing - the whole idea of break up has been floating around for years on-and-off. That said, I'm worried that if I stick it out, in a few weeks it all blow over and I just put off the problem. But I'm also scared that if I do end it, I'd regret it for the rest of my life.\n\nThere's also the added nightmare of sorting out accommodation at short notice and our many mutual friends that I suspect I might lose, although I've decided to ignore that for now and deal with that later.\nTL;DR:"}

I got her a bed set up, her bowls in the kitchen, all her toys...\n\nBut I feel like I just ripped her from everything she loved. Kitty Cat and her would wrestle each other all the time, she used to love \"cleaning\" Madison and would watch out for her in the yard. Her and my dad had a morning ritual together, with hugs and treats involved. Now she only has me and my boyfriend in a small apartment. No Kitty Cat, no Madison, no big living room to romp around in. \n\nI keep trying to remember that she'll have access to fenced-in dog parks now (which means off-leash), she'll have SO many new areas to explore and smell, so many new people to make laugh with her adorable little butt wiggle. \n\nBut she'll be alone the majority of the time. There is an added bonus that my boyfriend works from home, but it's not the same as wrestling around with Kitty Cat.\n\nI just wish I could explain to her what's going on and why she's here now. I'm almost wondering if bringing her here was a good idea. \n\nDoes anyone have any similar stories? Have I done the \"right\" thing by my dog? I'm normally not a doubtful person when it comes to decisions I've made, but she's the love of my life and I want her happy.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm [24/M] who just broke up with my [22/F] gf of 3 years.\nPOST: So me and my girlfriend lived to together up in NorCal. I started having issues with my finances and decided to move to SoCal for a job that was offered to me. We decided to stay together and things were looking out to be okay.\n\nHowever, we started talking more about our relationship and we decided to break up. She had been frustrated about herself (bad grades, work, being sick, and figuring out her major) and I was frustrated with myself (work, finances, and figuring out what direction to take my career). We were also frustrated with our relationship because both of our problems took a toll on the other and we became complacent and didn't do as much together and weren't happy.\n\nSo now we're trying to work on improving ourselves and be separate, but we are still talking and have good communication between us. We even want on a date a few days after the breakup: Cirque du soleil show, fancy dinner, romantic kiss, and a relaxing movie. The night before we cuddled on the couch as well. However, the following monday we went to breakfast and I brought up getting back together. She basically stated that she want's to be on her own and do things by herself and that we are better as friends than a couple (which I think is kind of a cop out since we are pretty great together normally). We definitely needed to work on some stuff though. \n\nI want to get back together because on that date I realized how well we fit together and how much I love her. I wanted to go on that date to remind us of how we were a few months ago before we became wrapped up in our own lives. I really think we made a mistake in breaking up instead of talking about what was going on with each other and truly having a partnership. \n\nShe's coming home for christmas and I'm not sure how to act. I know she doesn't want to get back together because she doesn't feel she's ready, but I don't know how to handle this weird relationship. She says she doesn't want to be in limbo. But we are definitely in limbo and I want to fix this.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: (26/M) with girlfriend (23/F) that lives in a perpetual state of 'what if'\nPOST: I've been dating my girlfriend for about six months now, and we are otherwise happy and discussing how our relationship might evolve. However, it seems as though every time we have a moment alone, it devolves into some line of questioning involving a 'what if' scenario about our future lives.\n\nFor example, today we were walking in the park together and enjoying the nice weather, and she randomly decides to inquire as to whether or not I'd be willing to take a job with significant travel requirements. I shrugged it off, since I hadn't even ever thought about the prospect of such a job, but she persisted and went as far as to say, \"I don't want to be a lonely wife someday.\"\n\nAt that point, I explained to her that everything is circumstantial and I'd never be able to evaluate a hypothetical job unless it actually came up, and then of course I'd include her in the decision and we'd make the best decision for us. But, she was unsatisfied with this answer and spent the rest of the walk moping.\n\nMy current job does not travel but once or twice per year, and I have not entertained any jobs that do, nor have I ever mentioned that it's something I would be interested in. So, it seems as if this was just something she was thinking about out of nowhere, and now she's all caught up worrying about it.\n\nThese situations are very common for us, and regularly involve wild hypothetical scenarios with no basis in the current framework of our lives. She's never aggressive about the questioning, just seemingly always very concerned. Many of these things are, in my estimation, far less likely than 1% of actually occurring.\n\nI can't get her to give up 'what if', and we have ruined countless great days and dates talking about things that are unlikely to even come up in our future lives. I want to be able to listen and communicate with her about her fears and concerns, but I'm at my wit's end with discussing things that are unlikely to ever happen.\n\nHow can I communicate with her more effectively and show her that I want to help her overcome her fears, but that I simply cannot answer questions about scenarios that don't exist?\nTL;DR:"}

In high school, I had a boyfriend (who started out as a good friend), but we dated behind my parents' backs and after 5 years, it got ugly and we broke up. In college, I went to a women's school, so I didn't have a lot of opportunities to casually meet guys. I'm pretty shy, and at the time was extremely depressed, so I didn't go to a lot of parties or try online dating. \n\nMost of the advice I've gotten over the years is to \"wait for a guy to make the first move\" and \"love will find you when you aren't looking\", instead of actual tips on meeting partners. I'm fairly average looking, but with pretty horrendous self-confidence issues, and I think people can tell that, which is why I've never been asked out or flirted with.\n\nCue now, where my life is moving in a positive direction and I really would like to start dating. Trouble is, I have no idea how. \n\nFor instance - there's one guy I encounter regularly (he's a frequent customer at the store I work at) who I chat with, and would be happy meeting up over coffee - but it feels weird and uncomfortable to just send him an invite or message, plus I don't even know if he's single. Living in a small, rural-ish town makes things harder - there aren't bars or meet-ups to go to, and going out to the nearby city is a weekend-trip affair. Most of my friends here are already in long term committed relationships too, some with kids, so there isn't a lot of 'going out'.\n\nHonestly, I'm looking for some concrete advice on what I can do or scripts to use to start up conversations. It seems like really basic stuff that I just missed the boat on, but I'm tired of it and want to do something to improve the situation.\nTL;DR:"}

Down at the fields, there were always games going on between the teams of the same age groups, and at these games, regular spectators (like parents for example) could be the 3rd base umpire, just for fun. Sometimes they would let the actual young kid baseball players do the umpiring.\n\nMy team was ranked 1st at the time, so I felt proud and kind of cocky to show up and be the 3rd base umpire. I asked a coach and he was totally okay with it. Eventually sometime passes and nothing really happens that involves the 3rd base umpire. I hear a \"ping\" as a batter hits a ball in another field, so I turn around to look, but at this moment a runner on second is stealing 3rd base and the ball is being thrown to the third baseman, a call for me to decide. I turn around a second too late, I hesitate and say \"out.\" There was an awkward silence from the players, the parents, and the coaches. But no one said anything and they silently agreed to the call. I felt terrible, because the team whose player I called out was a low ranking team, and they really could have used that man on third. It still bothers me to this day.\nTL;DR:"}

The city we live in has amazing restaurants and bars, and we like going out and trying new things on the weekends. He's offered to pay for me more, but it always depresses me and makes me feel like I'm not adding enough. I've told him so, and he says he doesn't mind paying. But with the rest of our relationship being so fair, I acutely feel this inequality. How can I feel at ease with this?\nTL;DR:"}

In the mean time he's built up more debt than he cares to know, and doesn't feel very good about himself.\n\nHe recently has been figuring out how to work hard, in the past year he has been working two jobs, I know he paid off one credit card enough for them to forgive him the remainder, but he has many others as well as school loans.  But even when he's improving, it's hard to see him face rejection, and the failures hit him harder because of it.\n\nI want to help but I don't know how.  He doesn't like taking advice, I know not to give it or he will do the opposite because he's stubborn, and I don't want to insult him by doing so.  I'm willing to offer him emotional support, but I don't want to give him pity.  I just want to be his sister again, and I honestly haven't felt like I have been for a while.  I think he just sees me as someone who will be more successful than him, and I don't like that.\n\nI had one idea, I'm going to start my full time career soon, and although I've got school loans, I'll be earning a pretty large salary (it's much more compared to what everyone else in my family earns).  I thought that once I'm settled and have some money to spare, I was going to offer to pay whatever he owes our mom.  I know to never give him money, and if I offer to do this I will make it clear that he never ask me for money.  Is this a good idea?  My mom thinks she will never see the money again, so I thought it would be nice for her to have it back.\n\nJust as a side note, my brother is almost 5 years older than me.\nTL;DR:"}

We ultimately want to get married. We're moving away from our respective families in about a month.\n\nAlthough we're very agnostic, our families are from different religions (Muslim & Hindu). Her family has been very accommodating towards my parents views and when we get married would love to perform both ceremonies and traditions to respect everyone's beliefs.\n\nMy GF and I are happy to do both as we just want to be together and do whatever we can to let everyone enjoy this moment with us.\n\nMy parents are pretty strict about exactly what they would like for my GF to do to go through an Islamic wedding ceremony. Although she has agreed to do it all, she asks that they allow us to do the Hindu ceremony as well for her family. I totally agree with her and of course we'll do both. My parents are absolutely against this and promise to abandon me (their son) and of course my GF (their to be daughter-in-law).\n\nWhat's the right way to go about here? I'm thinking we just do the Islamic bit for my parents and don't tell them about the other part. In that sense, they get what they want and they're happy. We will go on to do the Hindu bit for her family.\n\nMy parents are absolutely not willing to see any perspectives here and are extremely stubborn. They are not doing what's best for us but rather what is best for their beliefs.\n\nAny thoughts? What should we do? Should we just not tell my parents what they don't need to know (the Hindu ceremony)? I know this is not a healthy relationship with my parents but I want to try my hardest to keep them a part of our life before we can no longer deal with their unreasonable requests. They are hard-working folks but this is just beyond their depth of understanding and perspective.\n\nI love my girlfriend and will do what it takes for us. I know it sounds silly to \"choose\" my GF over parents but I would rather go with logic. My parents will likely do this with anyone that comes into my life.\nTL;DR:"}

This plan was sort of the best thing given to me.  And I don't mean necessarily forced, but just the best orthodox option, the ones that your relatives will expect you to do.  I do enjoy debate and politics but am not crazy about it.  I've always been good at school and this seemed to be the option to be safest to set me up.\nI was mostly passive with decision this as lawyers easily disregard females and acquire currency.\n\nThen something happened D:  I watched The Garden State.  No, I'm joking, but it's really hitting me that I don't want to take this pre-paved road of school, job, family, hometown.  My ticket out?  The army.  Now there are two main reasons that I do want to join.  Firstly, because it's something to have accomplished in life.  Sure, not everybody might not agree with supporting Big Brother or going to our wars but nonetheless, I don't think there's ever a place to plainly disrespect a soldier.  I've always wanted to do this sort of as an affirmation of my self-worth (sorry if that sounds narcissistic).  Then comes the benefits of college, housing, getting set up with jobs, going active so I can move to all the places I'd like to visit, etc.  So those who have served, what do you think of your decision?  whether it be positive or negative.\nTL;DR:"}

Today I was innocently looking through my fianc\u00e9's sent email looking for a file he sent to me when I found pages and pages of email responses to random girls on craigslist for casual sex. He included nude pictures of himself. I was absolutely devastated. He says he never has, nor ever wanted to do anything with these women, just get dirty pictures from them. I do believe on this.\n Once he even made up a whole story that someone hacked his computer and found a naked video he made of himself to give to me and was threatening to share it for money in case I found a video of him online. Turns out he was naked skyping with someone and they recorded it and were blackmailing him. More lies.\n This all comes as a huge shock to me because our sex life is/was our biggest problem. He almost never wanted to have sex with me or let me do oral even though I begged to do it almost every day. He claimed he just didn't know what turned him on or that he was never in the mood.\n We've been living together for 4.5 months, have thousands in nonrefundable deposits for the wedding... Before this he was absolutely wonderful. So sweet, kind and supportive. Our only issues were in the bedroom. Otherwise things were terrific. Since we were together we have always stated we had one very clear rule: 100% honesty. I was 100% honest with him about everything, and I thought he was with me... And regarding all that sex stuff- I am VERY open. I believe that monogamy is torture for males and am ok with an open relationship. The key is communication and trust. He also told me he had a porn addiction before we met, but when I asked about it he said since we met he almost never looked at it.\n\nWhere do I go from here? He has completely broken my trust and lied apparently many times to me. He says he feels like absolute dirt and promises to stop, just anything to get me back. I am devastated, I can barely move/eat/anything. I feel like there is a hole in my stomach and my heart has been ripped out. Should I stay or should I go?\nTL;DR:"}

These five years have been wonderful. Not always easy but I loved every minute we spent and had the feeling she did as well. The last years of our relationship have been hard on me. my father died. my job was demanding and my sister got really sick. she helped me through all of it. To make it short: I did lots of things I regret now. I worked too much and didn't spend enough time with her. since our breakup i realized that i did many things that must have upset her.problem was that i didnt realized it back then. I never cheated on her. but i smoked weed a lot. i was lazy. didn't do much to support her hobbys or interests. thing is: i know that i cant turn back the time and make up for it and should be trying to be happy by myself and meet new people. but I really, deeply love her. she is by far the loveliest person on earth. I truly want to spend my life with her. Im really glad for all the time we had together but it always reminds me of the fact that i fucked it up as well. sometimes we talk on the telephone and i try to be nice and seem happy but it crushes me every time.

Everything was good, and we started dating a couple of months later. Fast forward to now. While officially being a couple, it couldn't feel any further away from it. Sure we kiss, go on trips, and see each other as much as possible, but emotionally it still feels like we are just friends. Of the few months we have been dating, not once has she called me babe, baby, or anything of the sort (I usually call her babe, I thought she would maybe be comfortable with it by now). She will almost never text first, and certainly never call first. When we do text, they are few and far in between. I'll send her texts messages like, \"have a good day, I cant stop thinking about you\" only to have a reply that reads \"have a good day too!\" Its super disheartening.

Then while he is asleep, she notices that he keeps on getting texts from a friend and she checks it. Apparently, the friend said if he had met any cute girls at the club and he said that he was with her and that they are cuddling outside her house (true) and that she is getting touchy feely. The guy said 'what is wrong with that?!' and he said 'i just don't want to mislead her.' But she told me that in the car they kept on making out so what exactly does this mean? She did NOT go all the way with him but they did make out and there was some touching. What should I tell her to do? She doesn't really like the guy too much either but she doesn't want to feel used cause a guy did that to her a few months ago. She has yet to be in a relationship cause most guys don't treat her right - it's sad.\nTL;DR:"}

(UK)\nPOST: So late on the night of the 26th December, I was looking to book a hotel for a getaway with the gf. I notice that Expedia offer a \u00a320 off voucher for booking through their app - so I proceed to do this.\n\nThe price comes to \u00a388 at the checkout and so I make the payment. I then receive an email stating the price as \u00a3115.01. It shows that I used a voucher so the actual price of the hotel would have been \u00a3135.01.\n\nSo I've mysteriously been overcharged \u00a327 - I know this isn't a lot but it's about the principle at this stage.\n\nOver the last 10 days or so, I've called them 3 times and emailed them once. Every time they say someone will get back to me within 48 hours and they don't.\n\nI have a screenshot of the price at \u00a3108 (before voucher being applied) - I actually did this because it was the only place that mentioned free breakfast on the app.\n\nI finally spoke to a manager today who said that my case had been rejected but that he would email me asking for more information - he has not.\n\nMy guess is that as I was checking out, the price changed on the website and they charged me that instead. It looks like I started checking out before midnight and finished after midnight. But of course I was always quoted \u00a388 at checkout.\n\nBesides the fact that their app is clearly buggy, their customer service has been absolutely shocking. I've spent a lot of time on hold and a lot of money trying to get this sorted.\n\nAny suggestions on what to do next? Do I have a foot to stand on?\n\nThanks for reading.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend [22] and I [23] have been together for 4 years. Never had any trust issues before.\n\nA couple of days ago he got home a bit later than usual. I asked what he was up to and he told me he was at dinner with a friend. Okay, that's fine, doesn't bother me. Then he goes on to tell me his dinner was so expensive, and that he spent about $30. Out of curiosity I ask what place was so expensive that his meal alone was $30. \"Oh I paid for my (female) coworker.\" So he went to dinner with his similarly aged female coworker and paid for her dinner. I was pissed off. It sounds like a date to me. Especially because I don't know this woman, I don't know if she is interested in him, and if she were, him paying for her dinner wouldn't send the right signals that he's not interested.\n\nIt also pissed me off because I don't remember the last time he took me out. I bought him dinner when I got a bonus, I tend to do things like that. But I realize now that he won't pay for me unless he owes me money or something. He also makes about 20k more than me. Not to mention that while he's paying for this other woman I am home cleaning up his dogs piss.\n\nWhen I let him know that his dinner came off as a date and made me uncomfortable he couldn't comprehend why I was upset. He went so far as to mock me, telling me he was going to a friends party this weekend and he would probably chip in for her dinner, so I shouldn't cry. All I got from him was a \"sorry you feel uncomfortable about it\".\n\nAm I way off base here? Like I said, we have never had trust issues but this felt shady to me.

Overall, I have a pretty solid work history - I've been in career-relevant roles for the past 6 years, even while in school. There's only one blemish on my resume, and I'm not proud of it. \n\nAround a year and a half ago, I took on a position organizing a fundraiser for a small local group. Right from the get-go, this role was a disaster. The group was undergoing some major restructuring, and I did not have the support I needed to do thorough job. Additionally, the work-load, which was initially supposed to be around 10 hours a week, ended up being far more. The role wasn't a good fit, and it showed in my attitude (I was stressed out all. the. time). Anyway, long story short, I took the group through the critical period of organizing and supporting the fundraiser, but left around two months later. My leaving was difficult, and they made it very clear that they had expected me to stay. \n\nHere's the thing - I really want to clear things up with this group. Both for personal reasons (I know I didn't do a great job, and I want to let them know that I could have done better) and political (this is a small city, and I worry that word would get around). I'm considering sending an email looking to reconnect with my old boss. Has anyone had any success with turning a neutral reference into a good one by reaching out? Is this a horrible idea?\nTL;DR:"}

Should I assume sex?\nPOST: So a few years ago, I had a casual sex thing with my best friend at the time, over a period of about 5 months. To cut a long story short, we were both ridiculously attracted to each other and the sex was fantastic, with the added bonus that he was a really genuinely amazing friend. However it never became serious as we were both moving away to go back to university (we were on a 'work placement year' type of scheme). We were then both in serious relationships with other people for a few years and lost touch a bit, as it wasn't really an appropriate friendship to maintain.\n\nIn the last 6 months we've both become single and started to talk again (he helped me a lot through the breakup), and I'm now going to stay with him for a weekend in February. Can I assume that there's a good chance that this will end in sex? My primary concern, silly though it may be: would it be weird if I make assumptions about where I'm going to be sleeping, and turn up at his flat without a sleeping bag? Or would it be even weirder if I turn up at his WITH a sleeping bag? I'm very attracted to him and I can't see why his attraction towards me would have changed, but he is still first and foremost my friend and I don't want to make things awkward before I even see him in person, as it's been over 2 years since we last saw each other.

Growing up, I didn't have the best relationship with my mother. She has some undiagnosed and diagnosed mental health issues, and is incredibly impulsive and just a terrible decision-maker. She was a virgin until marriage at 21, and decided her children would be the same. The only sex education I ever had was \"don't do it\". No talk about safe sex, STD's, possible consequences, anything. She never even told me what to expect with my period. As a result (also of my terrible decision making), I had chlamydia and was pregnant by 16. \n\nMy sister is 7 years younger than me, and as the youngest, gets a fairly easy upbringing. My parents adore her, they have more money than they did when I was growing up, etc. however, as she has begun showing a very direct interest in boys, I understandably had concerns about sex.\n\nSo, she came up this weekend. We see each other maybe 1 time a year, so I took advantage of it. I pulled her aside to \"shop\", and told her I wanted to open a dialogue about sex. She was a little uncomfortable, but understood. I told her to always use 2 forms of birth control, how to avoid (if possible) bad situations where she could get in trouble sexually, and what to do if she wanted birth control and my parents refused to get it for her. I also told her (semi-scare tactic, I'll admit), about my pregnancy at 16. She was grateful, and sent me a text saying so. \n\nMy mon read the text thanking me for sex education, and is LIVID. Absolutely furious. Granted, I don't much care, as we are partially estranged and I am going to do what she won't when it comes to protecting my sister, but now I'm morally nervous that it wasn't my place, or she was too young, or I fucked up by talking to her about this stuff.

Our relationship was sorta rocky from the start, which led to permanent trust issues on my part. It didn't help that he continued to do shady things. I have no proof that he cheated on me, but I'm pretty sure he probably did based on multiple things I found on his phone, and the fact that he tried to cheat with me on the girl he dated after me. Instead of trying to reassure me he would never cheat he often just got mad at me for snooping, but often times I wasn't snooping I was using his phone for a legitimate purpose and just found something suspicious. He could always talk his way out of a the situation. But thinking back on the whole relationship it seems pretty clear he was likely cheating most if not all of the times. We probably broke up 3 times before our last \"permanent\" break up. Obviously the relationship wasn't all bad, we had fun times and he was often sweet, but overall he wasn't the best bf in the world or even the best I've had.\n\nAnyway a couple years ago we hung out a couple times( mostly just hung out and had sex) but we ended that arrangement do to a fight over something that happen right before we broke up the year before. Recently I had been thinking about him alot so I got in contact and we hung out for a few days, it was okay, but nothing great. I found myself wondering why I had been thinking about him so much after all these years. But now thats its been about 3 more months since I last saw him I have these feelings for him again.

This in turn has stressed out my Mother, and our whole family (I'm 20 years old, and I've got two younger siblings.) We still eat and we can still pay our mortgage, but things haven't been so great other than that. Canadian Tire is trying to get out of paying us for our losses.\n\nMy Dad still carries these injuries. He was an avid golfer, an avid skier and an avid ATV driver up until this happened. **There's a decent chance he'll never be able to do any of these things comfortably again**, and that's kinda super fucked up. I'm in a singer band and I keep imagining me losing my voice somehow and never being able to do something that I truly love ever again.\n\nPlease reddit, tell me how can I get my Dad more exposure? Can I somehow make Canadian Tire scared? He obviously has a lawyer and everything, but I feel like they're just gonna dick us around until we've got more exposure.\nTL;DR:"}

After almost 6 years together, i feel like I should be more upset than I am. I'm worried about myself, am I going to become severely depressed? Will I go crawling back to him in a month, begging him to take me back? I think I just need some reassurance from others who have been through this break-up before. He didn't do anything wrong, he loves me and treats me wonderfully. But it's just not the right thing for me. I wasn't happy, I know in my heart that I don't love him.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [22/m]My GF[20/f] of 6 years has stopped being intimate after major surgery.\nPOST: Throwaway account to avoid chance of her seeing this. \n\nA little backstory, my GF and I have been together for 6 years now and just last year we moved in together. We waited awhile till moving in together because she was still just out of highschool and starting college, so we didn't want the added stress of more bills. \n\nAt first moving out was great, we learned even more about each other and were having sex almost every other day. Slowly though I noticed  that us being intimate has become few and far between. I brought this up to her around 6 months ago and things got better for a little bit, but then I have a major surgery which didn't allow me to have sex without injury myself or tearing my wound. Throughout these 3 months I suggested that we still be intimate, but in other ways by just kissing and teasing each other. Then every so often some foreplay for both herself and I. This sadly only happened 2 times during my down time and 1 of those times I was left to handle \"it\" myself afterwards. \n\nBeing fully healed now and not being able to make love to my GF for over 3 months I was dying to have some alone time with her, but no matter what I tried she always seemed distracted, stressed out, or she missed her pill which caused an early period, so nothing worked other than her getting frustrated. Finally we were intimate a few days ago, which was started by me, and since it being awhile I didn't perform my best. After our 10 min. Session she seemed odd still. \n\nNow I am sitting here trying to figure out what happened to our relationship where being intimate became so small on the \"priority\" list. I have always loved to please my GF no matter what it was. This includes me going down on her every chance I can get and to always make sure she cums, even if my \"member\" fails to do that for her. I am planning to talk to her again about this, but am worried that it will go no where again or only help for the next couple months again. \n\nWhat do you think?\nTL;DR:"}

Our dynamic was great and we could talk about anything. Then came last year.\n\nIn October, her grandmother died and it sent her into a depression. This was only hightened when I failed to respond to her because I was too busy with my school work. As she continued to sprial down, I tried my best to be with her but it was hard. Here is where I made a mistake.\n\nI started talking to another girl in one of my classes. She seemed cool and it took me away from Jes. However, I never once had feelings for her. We did exchange books for our birthdays and I know this was wrong. I apologized but it only made it worse.\n\nFast forward to the end of the Spring semester. I help Jes by doing much of her school work because she couldn't do it. I wanted her to graduate because I knew once she did, she would become better mentally. We graduated and she seemed happier.\n\nThen she broke it off with me. She said that it felt as if we were too codependent. She said that she lost her identity because everyone saw us as \"the couple\" and not as our individual selves. She said it was her and not me. She felt guilty because I tried giving her everything and she couldnt give back anything. She said she wasn't ready to be in a relationship right now. She said she needed space. I cried, and I did it in front of her. At first I tried calling and seeing her but I realized that it would only make it worse.\n\nHeres the kicker, we work together. Although I don't come in contact with her at work that often, we do talk and exchange cordial hellos. However, I do miss her intensely and love her. I really do. Is there any way to win her back?

She's told me that if she moves to Louisville she'd love to try and make something work but that's not for another two years. I just don't think it's healthy on my part to be so caught up with her.

Questionable people entering and leaving, constantly yelling, door slamming, disturbances in the late night/early morning, constantly stealing electricity by plugging an extension cord in the hallway, etc.\n\nSome side information: The tenant use to have a dog and a child. I use to hear the dog whelping sometimes, almost like it was getting beat, but I couldn't see anything since it was behind closed doors. Someone reported an animal abandonment to the Ontario SPCA when the dog was constantly barking inside her apartment and while she was away for a couple days. Seemed like nobody was taking care of the dog. The dog is no longer there. I've also heard from other building tenants that the tenants daughter is being taken care of by a relative now.\n\nThis has been going on for months. The landlords hands seem to be  tied. Apparently the tenants \"guests\" can't be kicked off the property unless they cause building damage or caught doing criminal activity. Somehow she is paying rent, but I would imagine barely if she can't pay for electricity since she is resorting to stealing it. The cops are being called quite often but it seems they can't do anything unless they catch her in the act.\n\nOur building does have security cameras on each floor, but conveniently our apartment, and our neighbours apartment are just outside the camera vision so she can't catch her on camera.\n\nEverybody on my floor is frustrated. My landlord is frustrated. And it seems nothing can be done unless we have definitive proof. I was contemplating that my roommates and I (3 of us total) enter the hallway when she has the altercations in the night so we can be eye witnesses to the situation but it would probably be a bad idea and unsafe. I was wondering if we could setup a webcam to lookout the peephole and have audio recordings. At least that way we have something to present to the police without endangering ourselves. Though I'm unsure about privacy laws so I'm even hesitant to do that. \n\nJust looking for advice on how to solve this situation or give my landlord a way to evict them.\nTL;DR:"}

There's not much to be said.  I just feel awful that I'm even thinking this way when she's been so good to me, and we've been good together.  I'm hoping I can move past it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22 M] with my roommate [20/F], her boyfriend [29/M] has basically moved in.\nPOST: I'm a student/young professional living in NYC with my best friend/roommate, a 20 year old female art student, who I will call Lisa. (I'm gay, so no romantic attraction whatsoever.) This past January/February my roommate began dating a 29 year old man from Chicago, who I will call Billy, after they matched on Tinder while he was visiting NYC. Her boyfriend and I are very similar so we also became good friends. \n\nIn April Billy told Lisa and me that he was planning on getting a new job in NYC. In mid-May, during finals week, Lisa asked if it was okay if Billy stayed with us until June, when his lease began. I gave her permission. It is now mid July and Billy is still living with us. They both pretend he has a room of his own in a friend's apartment, but I know that can't be true. On top of that, he doesn't have a job lined up. He basically moved here to be with my roommate who is 9 years younger after 3 months of long distance dating!\n\nSo here is where things get tricky. Last summer my roommate was out of the country for two and a half months. During those months my ex-boyfriend basically moved into me. Also, my roommate pays more rent, so I'm not necessarily wanting them to pay a larger share (although I wish they would, but my ex did not so I would't expect her to). But do you all agree that her boyfriend moving in while I am actually living here is different than my ex living here while she was out of the country?\n\nHow do I approach this without alienating her or her boyfriend (who I still really like)? I don't want him to be homeless. But I also feel that, from the standpoint of a concerned friend, that their relationship is not healthy. Who moves in after long distance dating for 3 months? Also, my roommate's family is very, very wealthy, so she pays for most of his food and has even purchased him some very expensive designer clothing. I know how she spends her (parents) money is her prerogative, but it still seems a bit odd.\nTL;DR:"}

Over the past 3 months we have been fighting fairly regularly about communication mostly, and we've had many discussions and promises to continue working things out and then things will usually be fine for a week or two.\n\nJealousy was always a bit of an issue, but I had never given her reason to be. She always made a habit of reading my texts with friends or facebook messages, and I occasionally mentioned I didn't exactly love it but I had nothing to hide so it was no problem.\n\nThat is until recently. I met another girl through work, and I'm not particularly interested in her but we have some common interests so we had been talking on facebook on and off for the last few weeks. I didn't flirt with her or anything, but this upset my girlfriend enough to the point that we had another serious argument about it. \n\nI kept it platonic between myself and my facebook friend, but one day we had been talking more than usual (again, regarding nothing too serious) but to simply avoid the fight that I knew would occur I deleted the conversation.\n\nNow this was obviously a breach of trust on my part, and I kind of regret it because communication (something we could've easily talked about) is what we had aimed to be working on the most.\n\nHere's where things get even more complicated. As it turns out, she had logged in to my facebook account from her phone (she knew my password, but had never to my knowledge read any of my messages unless it was on my phone/laptop, in the same room as me) and was reading the conversation at the same moment I deleted it. So she was obviously quite upset, and understandably so, but she had breached my privacy further than any time before and now I'm confused as I know I made a mistake as well, but I don't know how to address something like this.\n\nAt the moment we have had an argument regarding it and resolved it for the time being, but I can tell that things aren't okay between us right now because it keeps coming back up, just in more calm shorter conversations.\nTL;DR:"}

I will also have to pay for books this semester, however I estimate my book cost will only be about 150-200 dollars at most if I can't find any free options online. This leaves me with about 300-500 dollars of expenses to pay for out of pocket for this semester out of my 3000-4000 I have in the bank. \n\nI was wondering, however, what pf would think of also taking out the 1000 unsub loan as well since it is a very low interest rate and would help keep me flexible in case shit hits the fan throughout the semester, as I will have money in the bank if I need it. My dad has agreed to pay for my food costs, as I will be doing my own cooking, but that could change and I like knowing that I have a cushion in the bank. Also this is my first semester in college, so I have no idea what other unforeseen expenses I may have to pay for.\nTL;DR:"}

The car at the very front is going about 5 mph trying to merge onto the parkway...but there are no other cars in sight. In other words, he's driving about 30 miles below the speed limit for no good reason. The car in front of me, a green (Honda, maybe?) understandably honks. Not obnoxiously, but enough to let the guy know to get a move on. The first car, a Volvo who I'll refer to as Bitchdick McGee, finally speeds up, heading straight into the right lane. Greeny speeds up and tries to pass on the left. BM VIOLENTLY SWERVES into the left lane to prevent him from passing. Maybe it was an honest mistake, but probably not. Ok. Greeny speeds up and tries to pass him on the right. BM again, violently swerves into the right lane to prevent the pass. Greeny moves left again, then right, but BM matches him swerve for swerve, driving right down the middle at one point, defending each lane like a basketball player protects his basket. This back and forth went on for about 15 seconds while I sat there astonished and unconsciously speeding to keep up with them. Eventually Greeny settled into the left lane behind BM, obviously not willing to mess with this crazy fucking asshole any longer. Unsure of what else to do, I snapped a picture of his car and license plate.  **reddit, my question to you is, is there anything that can be done to get this obviously unstable driver off the road?** I know I've often seen things while driving and said to myself, \"If there was an efficient way to do it, I'd totally report that guy.\" Well, reddit? What do you got? **Is there anything that can be done about this, besides complaining about it on reddit?**\nI'm headed to dinner now, but I'd appreciate any comments you guys leave!\nTL;DR:"}

The reason for this is because i simply dot like their personality for whatver reason. Its always bad becuase thats just usually the nature of breaking up as i understand it, but this girl is different. She comes from a bad background, abandonment issues, parental problems (her father, primarily, is a couple douche) etc...good person, but i just dont feel for her the same way she feels for me. Shes already claiming to love me, wants me around all the time etc. She thinks im the bestperson ever, and i make her really happy and so on...(besides the fact its only been about 3 months) i just dont feel that way for her, and in all honesty shes startting to kind of bug me. The last thing i want to do is hurt this girl but we got too close, too fast and if i break up with her i know it will really hurt her. In addition, shes has some depression issues and is not the most stable person, particularly given her current situation (kicked out of her house, parental problems etc) i fear for her safety. I'm not sure what to do. Also, how, when i do decide to end the relationship, do you do it without it seemingly coming out of the blue for the other person?

I'll just cut  straight to the chase.  \n\nMy gf she I (shes 18) met about 9 months ago and things clicked right away. I've always been the attentive type and I always put myself out the for her. We've never fought or had issues until a month or so ago. She's gotten busy which is fine.  She's in college, works as a manager,and just bought her first\n house. Now don't get me wrong I completely support her and understand.  But things just sorta feel off now.  \n\nAround the time she got the house I lost my job and have since then picked up another and am working full time. Well I'm not making as much money now and we were supposed to move in together and I'd help pay bills. Her father is also living there because of poor health but that's beside the point.\n\n Anyway what really bugs me is she's back to being friends with her ex and they talk pretty frequently which gets to me. Especially when she says I bug her by wanting to see her and help her and what not. I mean I feel like I get ignored and she talks to him because when she's busy working on the house she responds spottily and doesn't seem fased by it. However when I went over to help the other night they were messaging each other over Facebook very frequently which made me feel like shit. I'm also not in school yet but I'm starting in December and I'm working on my situation to help better myself and hopefully the relationship. \n\nI just don't know what to think, I get texts back like \"heyy\" when I say \"hey babe!:)\" etc. And \"k\" when I'm talking about something.  It's making me depressed and I haven't eaten for a couple days now. I don't know if I should break it off or suck it up and hope things get better.\nTL;DR:"}

He does not tell me a lot about the relationship he has with his ex, so i'm not sure how often he sees her but I assume it's very often because of his responsibilities for his daughter (he takes her to the gym, piano lessons, shopping, etc.). He also mentioned that prior to dating me they still had a friends with benefits relationship. I can't help but worry that there could still be old feelings involved. I'm not sure if i'm overthinking this. When we are together, everything feels great and he's really sweet and affectionate. He used to live with his ex but has since moved in with his parents after they broke up. He's planning on moving out, and has mentioned the idea of me moving in with him. Is it wrong of me to feel worried?\nTL;DR:"}

Because of that fact, the only choice I have in getting somewhere to live is to move into some kind of sublet or roommate situation. I am not a college kid. Yeah, I'm 23, so I'm not exactly old but I've been on my own for a while now and don't plan to go to school until the spring. In addition to that, I have a lot things I trying to fix in my life (getting my credit back up to what it used to be, working, saving up money, getting over a breakup), so I'm really not in a good headspace to want to be or attempt to make friends with anyone, even a roommate. I kind of just want to pay my portion of the rent, and just go to my room kind of thing. Is it fucked up to want that ? Do I have to try and feign interest in having a friendship with someone in order to have a place to live ?

She often turns around while saying nothing and makes straight eye contact for around 10 to 15 seconds. I tried to make a rational explanation of it all and put two and two together by assuming she acted this way towards all guys. I didn't start taking huge hints until another girl that I'm friends with in the class asked me if I was aware of how hard this girl I like was flirting with me.\n\nSo now here I am, interested in this girl that has been expressing her feelings toward me for over a month now and I have no idea what to do.

My wife and I have been together for 2 years, she just turned 30, I'm 26, and we only got married in July of this year, we found out literally a week before the wedding she was pregnant, but the wedding had been planned for 6 months, the pregnancy had nothing to do with it.  Our sex life is non-existent at this point, we've done it a few times during the pregnancy, every time we did (except at the beginning) she experienced a lot of discomfort, and was very critical and frustrated.  My wife took a new job towards the beginning of the year and it's very stressful, much more so than my own, she also moved in with me at the same time and she had never lived with someone before.  My wife also has diagnosed OCD (she just worries about everything, no counting or anything like that) and stress makes OCD way worse.  After taking the job, she upped her med dosage and the crazy/awesome sex life we had ceased to exist.  She went to the doctor who told her she has a low libido and they were discussing options (none of which were very good) when she got pregnant.  She is off meds now and won't take any due to small risk to the baby.

She doesn't mind me asking for sex so much as when I tell her that the way things are going is wrong and she should care more about my needs.

We've been close for almost 2 yrs, but lately it's been pretty \"best friend\"-y.  She's kinda bi, but mostly lesbian.\n\nShe brought up relationship stuff (indirectly - I think she was nervous), and nicely said I wasn't her type.  She said her comment was partly because I'd told her how gorgeous she was (right after learning she had lots of \"image\" insecurity).  I asked if I shouldn't say stuff like that, but she was surprised and said it was totally fine, and really nice.\n\nI didn't say \"you're not my type either\" (she's sensitive), but after it got awkward, she asked what women I'm into so she could be a better wingwoman.  Some of my descriptions (introverted, adventurous...) were pretty different from her.  She even said, \"So, not me.\"\n\nI was going to talk to her again, but the next time I saw her, she called me \"darling\".  Does that mean it's ok?  She calls me stuff like that sometimes, and it's not like part of her regular vocabulary or something.  She's also pretty affectionate towards me.\n\nI've called her \"cutie\" a few times (since the \"image\" insecurity), and it didn't seem awkward, but should I stop doing that?  Is \"cutie\" different than saying \"awww, you look so prettyyyyyyy\"?  It's essentially what I do for my sister when she's upset, except with a big hug, and replacing \"pretty\" with \"you're so gross\", and \"cutie\" with \"monster\".  She likes it :P\n\nAnyways, idk what to do about my friend.  She's so sweet and so special, and I want her to believe that, but I also don't want her to worry about breaking my heart, because that's not an issue.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [28F] friend I've [28M] been dating is insecure after stalking my ex in fb. Dating 10 months before 8 year friendship.\nPOST: So first of, thanks for the read. It al starts with this girl I've been friends with since almost 8 years. We really didn't try things since we were always at different realtionships, but starting this year I kissed her and things changed between us and we couldn't deny there was always something.\n\n Fast forward November, I don't really keep much contact between my exes but my last one decides to call me and we end up chatting a little ( nothing serious mostly just music) and she ends up posting a song I recommended her on her fb. Just to clear things up my friend and her aren't even friends and never were. So next day I end up seeming my friend pretty pissed about something (which happened to be the song I recommended and she happened to assume that I did recommend it to her, which in this case she was right) she got angry with me and lasted a few days like that. But she never told me the reason why, so I had to find out through some other friends.\n\nWe eventually ended up together again but last week the same thing happened and I since then haven't even had contact with my ex since I knew how things ended. I really care for my friend and I wish she could be the one. But things are starting to get pretty fucked up if she's gonna go stalking my ex and assume everything she posts is something about me or it was either a song or movie I didn't recommend.\n\n I tried telling her the truth but she is very angry and I can't figure what to do. She said she wasn't even gonna mention it and that she would be ok in a couple of hours after seeing that. But here's where I wonder if somehow I was also wrong by trying not to clear things up and do all the explaining, since I hate this kind of drama and want to avoid it from happening again.\n\nWe're two grown adults, I seriously don't get why this drama is happening. She's known me more than anyone and she knows I would never cheat or do something like that.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: I'm being set up with a girl I don't know but am interested in, and could use some advice\nPOST: Hey Reddit, got a situation here I could use some help with.\n\nI'm 24 and I've been single for nearly 2 months now. Previously, I was in solid LTRs (explanation below) for roughly 6-7 years and I'm completely out of practice as far as the dating scene goes. My recent experiences show that I have a tendency to get friendzoned before anything happens.\n\nWell, my sister had the idea to set me up with a girl my age that is in her performance group. I agree and get a name, do some facebook stalking so I know who to look out for, and a few days later I go to a performance. Then after the performance I go to where they're cleaning up and my sister introduces her to our mom and myself. I couldn't think of anything I could do or say in the situation with the overbearing-ness that was my sister and mom standing right there. So I introduced myself and that's about it. I am sure I came across as shy. We made eye contact for only a couple seconds.\n\nI'm definitely interested and don't want to mess it up.\n\nSo basically at this point I don't know any of her contact info and we're not friends on facebook. I'm looking for tips on how to proceed. I found the [how to flirt guide] this morning, is there anything similar I could reference? Should I let my sister continue to set us up or should I step in? When should I take the reins?\n\nLTR Explanation: For the last 6-7 years I suppose you could say I took the \"easy way out\" and simply started a relationship with an old girlfriend from high school or something. From what I remember, very little was needed in the way of flirting or building attraction, as I already knew them fairly well before we started dating.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I am deeply in love but feel toxic to my boyfriend's mental health.\nPOST: Boyfriend and I (both 18) have been dating for about two years now, after having been friends for a few years beforehand. I've always had very strong feelings for him and we are very much in love. But there are a few problems, and all of them are my fault.\n\nTo begin, when I said \"strong feelings\" I meant wildly, unhealthily strong. It has always felt sort of like an obsession. I miss him when I don't see him for a day, I feel overprotective, and I think about him when deciding what to wear, say, blog about, etc. To get the idea better, I found a blog post from the Online Counselling College that sums it up: I'll post a link in the comments.\n\nApart from that, I have a lot of mental/psychological problems and barriers, a lot of topics that set me off, and I've become wildly jealous when I never used to be. I hate it, because I used to be so relaxed and now I've become the stereotypical psycho girlfriend. I deal with a lot of anxiety and I fall into spells of depression easily as well, a result of a less-than perfect childhood. \n\nBasically I feel that at this point I'm holding my boyfriend back; he's very intelligent and driven and knows what he wants out of life, and has a lot of potential. He deserves someone who's stable and will help him become successful rather than someone he has to take care of. But as I said before, I'm extremely attached and our lives are rather intertwined at this point. We have a lot in common and were the seemingly \"perfect couple\" that our friends were all assuming would be happy long-term. I think my boyfriend to be my best friend, since almost all of my other friends have become distant, and I can't imagine what I'd do without him. In the ideal situation I'd figure out how to become stable again, and continue on how we used to be. But I'm definitely facing a lot of problems that therapy hasn't seemed to fix, and I feel like I'm not making any progress, so the longer I stay I'm  making my boyfriend's life harder.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU By Rushing a Preflight Walk Around\nPOST: Well this actually happened last summer.  I'm a flight student and, at the time, was training for my commercial pilot license.  I got onto the ramp and to the airplane a little late and my instructor would be there soon.  I did a quick walk-around and hurried back inside the plane to get the current weather information and a clearance.  Well my instructor showed up and we started the plane up and went to the runway.  I got my takeoff clearance, got on the runway, and accelerated.  Now for the fuck up.  My preflight was so rushed that I forgot to remove a cover off of the tubular sensor located under the left wing that gives me an airspeed indication (how fast I'm going through the air).  Oops!  That's really really really important information that I don't have now!  Normally, it takes a little time for the gauge to kick in and start reading more than zero.  Initially, I thought it was just taking a little longer to kick in, which would have been unusual, but not too bad.  Later on the takeoff roll, my 6 a.m. drowsy mind realized why my speed was still showing zero and that I was a dumbass.  Too bad I took so long to put it all together because I was running short on available runway and had to decide if I was going to lift off or abort the takeoff.  I wasn't 100% certain if I'd stop in time so I lifted off because I knew for sure that we had enough speed.  Of course, we couldn't do the training flight without airspeed indication so I had to land and take the plane back to the ramp.    I won't be making a mistake like that again. That was embarrassing because normally, I'm very meticulous in the way I do things - especially when it comes to checklists.  Also, the consequences of missing an item on a preflight inspection can be a lot worse depending on what was missed.  The school charges by the total time the engine is running so because of the amount of time spent on the ground waiting for a takeoff clearance and the added instructor fee, my little lap around the airport flight ended up costing me $250 *cha ching* :(\nTL;DR:"}

And the fact that she is ugly.\nPOST: I have been dating this girl for a few months now and I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. At first I did not really see this as anything long term, but gradually I have started to appreciate every little thing about her. I have started to picture us together in the future, travelling together, starting a family. \n\nThe problem is that I've spent most of my life working my ass off and have not really had much time for dating or relationships.  I'm close to finishing my PhD and I always imagined myself spending some time after that dating and finding out what I want. But now I suddenly find myself in this relationship that I can see potentially lasting forever. \n\nI think about this a lot, for example after after a recent conversation where she was telling me about some of the awkward dates she had in the past, because I know \nthat it also helped her figure out what she wants and to realize that I'm the right one for her. A part of me wants the same experience. I am afraid that I will always be looking back and regretting not to have tried anything else. \n\nConfession: While writing this, I finally had to admit to myself the biggest reason for my hesitation. It was difficult to face it, but I have to be honest. If my girlfriend was perfect there would be no problem, but in the looks department, she is a 5, while I am a 9. I don't want more dating experience just to make sure that my current girlfriend is perfect for me, but also to convince myself that a \"traditionally\" prettier girl would not make me any happier. Because the fact is that I know that my girlfriend would make me happy, and that I can make her happy. \n\nI know that I can't just tell her that I love her, but that I need a few months on my own to find out what I want... \n\nAre there any solutions to this problem? I realize the obvious answer is \"you just don't want to be with her, end this\", but that simply isn't true.\nTL;DR:"}

I could cry thinking about how pure and unconditional his love is for me....he inspires me and teaches me so much about how beautiful love is. \n\nBut then I think of myself, and I just can't compare.

I understood this and wanted to be with her, so i said yes even though i didn't really want it, and yes i told her that. \n\nNow about 2 months later we are having serious issues. We both love each other and both see a future with each other, but the openness is killing me, i told her that but she cant have a monogamous relationship, but neither one of us wants to break up. We are out of ideas. We are at a standstill and not sure how to proceed from here. Any ideas guys?\nTL;DR:"}

I've wanted a pug dog for an extremely long time. The first bad sign is that I purchased a one year old male pug before we even had time to settle in. Browsing /r/pugs daily caused me to be over ecstatic for my first dog.\n\nIt's been two weeks and he's grown more aggressive. My girlfriend and I both work fulltime so he is by himself for 8+ hours a day. The bottom floor kitchen and bathroom are connected so we gate him up in there with his bed, toys, puppy pads, food. He would cry for long periods of time. I purchased a Thundershirt and it's helped with his separation anxiety. \n\nThe problem is is his growing aggression when we finally come home. He runs around chewing up misc items, licking, playful biting, etc. I left him alone for one hour last night to shower and found my glasses chewed up, poop on the carpet, etc. When my girlfriend came home to find the destruction, I have never seen her that angry. She informed me she hates the dog, wants me to get rid of him, and the decision for either him or her.\n\nI love my girlfriend and I love my dog. I believe that although a dog is a lot of hardwork, the payoff and reward is great. By teaming up with training a dog it helps us if potential parenthood happens down the road. I'm not sure what to do - obedience school, patience, stricter training etc;\nTL;DR:"}

We went out drinking every night and there was a lot of bars etc. So me and my friend, let's call him T went out while the others were home (Yes, fucking lame). So it was about 10 minutes to go in to the small town. So there wasn't a lot of people outside because the clock was 22am and the nightclubs opened 23 am. We sat down at a small bar, not a lot of people only 6 guys talking to the security guards. We had a beer and a smoke and we talked for a bit. \n\nI got very fucking drunk after an hour drinking so we decided we would go and check out the [nightclub] So it was still 10 minutes before the nightclub opened and there was a huuge black security guard setting up  parasols (Why set up parasols in the night?) So we sat down and T were eager to speak to the Danish guys sitting on a bench right next to us. So I sat there alone drinking a beer (I can't remember what happenend next but I fell asleep). The huge black security guard woke me up and said \"I guess you're done for the night\" and poured out my beer. \"Hey I wasn't finished with that!\" I said and he looked at me. \n\nI got up and started to walk to the entrace and said that I wanted a new beer. He quickly followed me to the bar and bought me a new beer. I was just about to go out when I slipped and faceplanted right into the fucking security guard from behind. He turned around picked me up and fucking threw me out of the club and said that I could never come back. What a great night out.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know why but I'm okay with ALL other aspects of sex before the actual penetration occurs. I give great oral, I'm a very sexual person, but as soon as we start to have the actual sex, I completely shut down. I'm not sure why but I get really panicky and the last time we had sex after it was over I went to the bathroom and cried. I'm away at school in a different state so whenever he visits I find a way to distract him and in the 3 months before I left I kinda just didn't let him have sex with me. I go back for thanksgiving break soon and I really want to have sex with him but I'm afraid that I'll feel the same way. It's honestly always been like this, in other relationships I just never enjoy the sex and because of my aversion to it it always wrecks the relationships. Also, this comes with an intense fear of pregnancy that my mother gave me when I was younger. She always told me that I'd get pregnant if I EVER had sex and she hasn't allowed me to go on birth control and bad things would happen if she found out that I did.\nTL;DR:"}

Immediately after impact, the driver (female) and passenger (male, boyfriend) got out to see if I was okay. They both said they were in no pain and wouldn't file an insurance claim or anything like that. Highway patrolman came and we got everything straightened out.\nOne week later, I got a call from my insurance provider (Progressive). They said the other party filed a claim and the passenger was experiencing neck pains. My insurance went up, but I thought that was it.\n\nFlash forward to last week. I got another call from Progressive. Basically, the neck injury is substantial and the passenger wants $15k to cover his medical expenses and $63k to cover pain and suffering. I have 21 days (from last week) to respond or they will file a lawsuit. Progressive sent me a copy of the legal document they received from the other party's lawyer and they also sent me a letter to explain it. Progressive says they will cover up to $50k if it comes to that.\n\nI don't know much about lawsuits or anything like that, and I don't have much money to my name.

I made an 1860 and I didn't care to take it again. I applied to the school during the first available time during my senior year. I didn't apply to any other school because I knew that was the school I wanted to go to and I would be easily accepted. No surprise, by November of my senior year, I was accepted. I was offered the opportunity to apply for a scholarship from the school, which I took it up and got the acceptance package in December. A full. Fucking. Ride. With dorms and meals free as well. Knowing that I would be secure with all this, I decided to take college classes to accelerate my college career. I went to the local community college and maxed out my hours while still going to high school, and finishing all my core classes by the end of my senior year. Now, all during this time, I had in the peace of mind that I was going to get a full ride to the school of my dreams and get to study what I wanted to (business). I wasn't obsessed over applying for other scholarships because I wanted people who really need the scholarships to get it instead of me who already had a full ride. \n\nNow, 2 weeks before school starts, I get a phone call telling me that my scholarship is terminated, along with all my housing and meal plan because I got 1260 (reading and math) instead of the 1300 requirement. Not to mention that I had to drive back and forth to campus to give them paper work that I already gave them 6 times. The same paperwork.

If you were to look at it on her side you would just think she is just a good friend. Now I wouldn't be confused at all if she hadn't been the one to initially show interest in me which I took as a cue to ask her out. I'm not sure whether she just hasn't had much experience in relationships because of her age or whether she just doesn't feel anything for me now.   \n\nI plan to confront her and ask her about what her feelings are, I'm prepared to let her go if that's how she feels. However I really want the relationship to work if she wants to and I'm just not sure how to explain this to her. I have been waiting to do so because she has exams (my first gf broke up with me during exam time and I'm definitely not putting her through that) and maybe it's just a matter of her being so busy.\nTL;DR:"}

I went to r/confession and some people told me to talk to my gf about it (ive also read a lot of articles about how to get rid of this fetish, because I am ashamed to be a cuckold and they said that they might go away if i talked to her). \n\nSo today I talked to her about it, expressed all of me thoughts and feelings, and she tells me that she is also kind of turned on by other men having sex with her as well as me (she would never cheat on me). So we start discussing this further and she tells me that she would like to have a threesome with one of her friends that she used to work with. \n\nHere is the problem: This guy has texted my girlfriend multiple times about her leaving me for him and how much he loves her and all that. ( told her that she could still text him because he is her friend and that I trust her)\n\nThis was a wake up call.\n\nAfter she told me that, I grew nauseous and couldn't even look at her.

However, in my experience a lot of guys that I befriend eventually see me more than a friend. 80% of the time, it's never platonic. Some of my close ones have admitted to liking me once upon a time, and I've even had a one night stand with one of them. But I never felt anything more than friendship with these guys.\n\nI'm in a serious relationship now, and of course, still seeing me as their friend, they often invite me to events. Sometimes one-on-one, sometimes with a group of friends. As respect to my boyfriend, I don't want to go see them due to past sexual encounters, and also knowing they have liked me before. I know I would never make a move, nor would they as they know I'm taken, but it's the principle of respect in a relationship.\n\nThe thing is, how do I tell all my guy friends this? I can only make up an excuse to not make events so many times. I obviously can't bring up my bf, because it's not like he's forbidding me to see them. But I would be uncomfortable with him seeing past flings or girls who have liked him before.\n\nDeclining so many events with guy friends have sadly dubbed me as \"flaky.\" And I've also had someone I thought was a friend insult me, saying I'm anti-social and a bitch for not hanging out with him. Of course I was able to see his true colors and it was his loss, but I think I still owe it to my actual real friends an explanation.\nTL;DR:"}

I haven't gotten salty or anything and was happy she wasn't lonely and stuck at home all day anymore.\n\nHowever, a few nights ago, she got angry at me because I wouldn't call her until she fell asleep (something which we used to do all the time) and accused me of being jealous of her friend getting more attention than me. \n\nIn reality, I was playing games with another friend had chosen to keep playing with him over leaving him and prioritizing her like I used to. I explained to her that we'd barely spoken for almost a month and I had simply drifted away a bit. This was what prompted her anger.\n\nAm I wrong to have done this when in the past I'd have prioritized her? She feels like I should be more accommodating and support her trying to build a strong friendship. I, on the other hand, haven't given it much thought and simply made a decision based on what I'd rather do at the time. I tried to explain that I hadn't made a concious decision that I would \"drift away\" from her, it had just happened and told her that I'd have been happy to do it if I wasn't busy.\nTL;DR:"}

There's definitely been multiple rough patches, repeated on-off relationship rollercoastering. I moved away 2 years ago for school and it's been long distance ever since.

At this point, I realize that the relationship hasn't progressed to anywhere real and we're back to square one. I sort of resent the fact that he is not willing to make sacrifices. I haven't been happy in this long distance and I felt more and more unhappy ever since I learned that he was interviewing.

In the past, I would describe to a mutual friend how frustrating you are where she convinced me to discuss my problems with you.

We even share life chaning intellectual conversations that bare our souls in front of each other while feeling connected on certain things.

She of course did not take it very well and was crying as I left. \n\nLiterally not 10 minutes after I left her home she was sending text after text asking, \"why I would do that to her\", \"she would've done anything for me\", \"she now knows what heart break is and didn't think I'd be the one to cause it.\" She sent me another text very early in the morning the next day and asked if I was cheating on her...

We proceed with the original plan.. \n\nThe last one was while in the forest. We were a good hour into the trail when we deviated off the trail to see some site seeing.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/cats\nTITLE: Not sure if this is the correct sub, but I need help with a cat that pees...\nPOST: So I have a 3-y/o female cat which was a feral rescue kitten. She is well cared for, the usual drill... But she never really adapted to using a litter box. She usually finds a corner, and pees. Over the years we have trained her to use the litter box, but she occasionally has accidents. This one spot in particular, well I can't say it's entirely her fault she pees there but I'm having a heck of a time training her not to go there. Basically, we have a laundry room in our condo where we keep the litter box. Since it's a condo, we can't put a cat door on the door to the laundry room, so we are forced to leave it open. A few months ago, this door was closed somehow while we were away for a day and the cat peed and pooped right in front of the door. I cleaned it using enzymatic cleaner, but since it's a carpet floor, I imagine some scent remains. The cat still occasionally pees and poops there, literally 3 feet from her cat box which is cleaned often. In the past, I have used a PetSafe scatmat to deter her from doing her deed in the corners, etc, but this spot is tricky... I do not wish to deter her from entering the laundry room where her literbox is located by using a scatmat. I also am allergic to a lot of repellent sprays, and I can't seem to find something like an x-mat which is small enough to be placed over the offending area. I should also note this door she poops in front of is in a high-traffic hallway.\nTL;DR:"}

She hasn't even tried to get to know him because when we first started dating, my boyfriend made some stupid jokes to her about \"going vegan\" and she immediately got defensive and complained he was trying to \"convert\" her.\n\nOf course, I went to bat for her AGAINST MY SO. My boyfriend and I almost broke up over that (which is totally reasonable in hindsight). But we stayed together and now have a very strong, healthy, communicative relationship. \n\nRecently, him and I have decided to move in together, but we're moving down to Florida because that's where he's from.

She works in retail selling furniture and there is a guy there, we'll call him \"L\", who has had a severe infatuation with her.\n\nShe's told me she has more respect than that to make face at work and she's adamant that nothing is going on. However...\n\nWe have off schedules (she's off Wed/Thurs and I'm off on weekends) so be barely see each other. When she gets off work at 6 PM on some days, she immediately goes out with L to \"drive around\" and \"smoke\" weed. She comes home hours later, sometimes midnight or 1 AM reeking of pot and then goes to bed. Sometimes she stays over at a \"friend's house\" if she really doesn't feel like seeing me.\n\nJust last night she went out again immediately after getting off work and he picks her up at our apartment. I glance out the window and his car is horizontal at about a 30 degree NW direction from me so I can't really see straight on. It LOOKED like he kissed her when she got in, but maybe it was just me convincing myself. **They've also been seen together going to movies, out to eat, etc.**\n\nAnyways, she says she and I aren't working out because I treat her poorly (I don't) and I'm boring because all I do is come home, go on the computer, or go skateboarding. She's been living pretty much free for the past 3 months; she hasn't paid anything towards rent/utilities, cell phone, etc.\n\nEverything in the house was purchased under my name on my cards. I'm not afraid of her taking anything because I believe I have ownership in this case.\n\nWhat's your view on this kind of specific situation? Do you think she's cheating? Is she just hanging out with him strictly because she wants to escape from it?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I'm [19m] not sure what to do or think in complicated LDR with a girl who's distanced herself [18f] from me\nPOST: I'll try to make a long story short. I've never had a serious relationship with a girl, and last summer, I met a girl from work. We became very, very close, and ended up spending the summer together. We were inseprable. I'd never felt so happy and content with myself. It turned into one of the best summers I've ever had. We were always telling each other how much we liked one another. We were dreading the end of the summer.\n\nThe big problem is that I decided to take a gap year before college, in Europe. The second the summer ended, I was gone. Jane said that she wanted to keep in touch everyday, and I was more than happy to do so. We kept in touch nearly everyday via Facebook message and text, skyping only a few times. We always talked about how great it would be when I got back from Europe, and how much we missed each other. That started around August last year, and had been going on up until about two months ago, in April. I was making the majority of the effort to stay in touch all year, and it seemed that she genuinely wanted to keep in touch and liked talking. Come April, she pretty much just stopped. The Facebook messages stopped, and whenever I texted Jane, it was very clear that she wasn't interested in talking. Whenever we did text, it was always all about her. I'd ask all the questions, and she'd usually respond with one word answers. So rarely did she ask even so much as, \"how's your day been?\" There were some other instances where it was extremely apparent that she was distancing herself from me.\n\nI get back from Europe in a week. I've been waiting to see her all year, and now I'm freaking out, because it seems very obvious that she isn't even interested in communicating. I've given up putting forth effort because I'm so sick of the one way street. Does all this mean that she's completely uninterested in being with me this summer? Sorry if this is very convoluted and rambling, I've never written a post before.\nTL;DR:"}

We've always had an incredibly open and honest relationship and can talk about anything without judgment or resorting to petty fighting. \n\nRecently he got a new job 8 hours away from our hometown. Switching schools would have been too costly and the job market in his new town was lacking so we decided to do long distance. It's been tough but we talk on the phone, Skype, and he's able to occasionally visit about once a month. His job takes up a lot of time and he's often busy . \n\nHe left for his new job in a hurry and wasn't able to clear out all of his stuff from his old place so the past couple of times he came to town he's been sorting and gathering what he can. His old roommate is moving soon so he has to get all of his stuff out asap or it'll be thrown out. \n\nUsually he'll let me know when he's in town and I'll hang out while he tries to sort through all his stuff . He hasn't been able to finish yet and blames me for a lack of productivity, as we both distract each other easily when trying to get stuff done. He's mentioned coming into town without telling me so he can finish cleaning out his old place but I made it pretty clear I'd rather know he's in town and give him space than have him keep me in the dark. \n\nI found out he flew into town this weekend without telling me and initially gave him the benefit of the doubt. His work schedule is insane, often 12+ hours a day, so maybe he just didn't have time to contact me. I gave him a call and asked what he was up to and he told me he was relaxing in (town he lives in).\n\nI'm incredibly hurt knowing he lied to me and is in town without trying to see me.

What do?\nPOST: So I found a beautiful apartment in an amazing neighborhood in New York City on Craigslist. The rent advertised isn't completely ridiculous, but the situation has smelt sketchy to me since the first email. The folks renting it out are an old couple that are retiring to Dublin Ireland and were looking for someone responsible and committed to rent to. That's where I come in. After about a week long interaction, including me sending a resume' and a copy of my state ID card, they have agreed to mail me the key and security code to the apartment to check it out. They say if I don't like the place, I can send the stuff back. Here's the catch. Because of the value of the apartment, as they claim, they are sending the key with a local insurance plan that adds about 4 times the cost of shipping to the price of the package. They are asking me to first transfer money to their assistant in London (whom they have given full name and address of) so that they are sure that I will not just take the key and run. I see where they're coming from, but transferring money BEFORE getting something seems like a shit situation to be in. I requested that they send me some sort of proof of either personal ID or ownership before I send the cash, so that if something happens I have something to fall back. I'm still nervous though, and not sure where I can be left legally.\nTL;DR:"}

I should add at this point that I have some form of Aspergers (diagnosed, I'm meeting a behavioural psychologist specialising in ASD to help with understanding interpersonal relationships soon which I am looking forward to but that is a another story) and I have not had a lot of experience with women.

In the meantime I was dating other people, getting my degree done, getting honours, starting my postgraduate course and generally becoming a better and wiser person. \n\nNow she's back in our country, and she is doing some of the subjects that I did in my final year of my degree. She asked me whether I had any notes and advice, which I handed over (I got first class honours in my degree so I feel beholden to hand over notes in that situation). We kept chatting about things via facebook and I kept advise her. I am working at the University where I used to study currently and I asked her whether she had time to meet up for lunch, to which she said yes.\n\nOn one hand, I am looking forward to meeting her because as I said before, she's a good friend (we have some common interests re nerdy stuff) and it's been quite a long time.

My first time down the diet trail I lost a good bit of weight, about 75lbs total.  I got down low enough (180 or so from 255) that my wife commented my cheeks were looking sunken and I was looking overly skinny in general.  I recognized this as a red flag and stopped my diet since it can be pretty easy to sink into an eating disorder.  I still had some back handles though, and some padding on the belly.  but I also was low on lean mass from dieting pretty hard the last time around.  And there was no doubt some loose skin that overly-critical-me was calling fat.  \n\nSo I spent the spring building up some muscle.  I'm on my way back down from 200 to 180, and I've still got the same problem areas.  Leftover back handles and a little belly padding.  I definitely have more definition from the extra lean mass I built, but I'm starting to worry that by the time I get to my goal weight again I'll  be looking too skinny (like, unhealthy skinny) in my face and arms while my problem areas remain.  \n\nI'm wondering if this is just something that it takes a few cycles to get rid of, as my body gets better at partitioning fat when I go to do lean mass building then dieting again.  it seemed like when I got back up to 15% bodyfat during my build cycle that I looked a lot better than I did at 15% the last time I was there.  It's a total vanity goal, but I'm looking to get a 6-pack so I can say I had one once in my life.  And I'm 100% willing to get it through careful planning and hard work.

I'm very near my weight goal, yet am inexplicably recently unable to lose weight.  In fact, if anything I'm gaining.  Does anyone have insight into what's going on?\n\n**Stats**\n\n5'3'', female, started diet at 157 pounds, goal is 113 pounds, currently 121.6 pounds.  Avoiding sugar & carbs, reducing calories.  Light/infrequent exercise.\n\n**Background**\n\nI started my diet in January of 2011, weighing 157 pounds.  I began by avoiding carbs and sugars, and later reduced my daily calories as well to about 800/day.  As you can see from [my weight chart over the past five months] this has worked pretty well.  Pretty well, that is, until about two weeks ago, when I became stuck around 119.  Suddenly, no amount of calorie reduction will get me lower than 119!  Over the holiday weekend I ate delishuz BBQ, and predictably went up to around 121.  Yet still, nothing will make me lose weight from there.  I've tried eating less and less to try and make my weight go down, but nothing works.  I have to admit that for the past three days I've eaten no food at all and only drank water, coffee, and Diet Coke, yet still my weight [will not go down and has slightly gone up]  I'm only 9 pounds to my goal, and I have no idea what the problem is. I don't even see how it's possible to gain weight over three days of fasting.\n\nSince it may come up, I'm fairly sure I'm not pregnant since I have an IUD, but I'll get that tested today anyway.\nTL;DR:"}

Should I run through ankle/knee pain?\nPOST: I ran XC for four years in high school, 8 seasons total including 2 years of winter/spring track.  Six years later I have now decided to get back into running with the goal of running some local 5k races and eventually PRing again.  My 5k PR in HS was ~18:42 -- not terrible but not great, so now that I'm in my early 20s I'm sure I can do better.\n\nI've been running now for about a week.  I wanted to start off slowly so as to build a solid base and avoid injury.  Every day I have been running 3mi with a 5-minute break in the middle, during which I stretch and catch my breath.  I've been doing this at a very easy pace, about ~9:00-9:30/mi.\n\nBy the fifth day my ankles and knees were hurting pretty badly, to the point where I was basically hobbling around my apartment all day.  I took a day off of running yesterday, and today I went back and only did one loop (1.5mi).  Total mileage for the week is ~19 miles... nothing crazy.\n\nI'm wondering if I made the typical mistake of doing too much too soon?  I doubt that because I don't feel like I have been pushing particularly hard, especially in a cardiovascular sense, but maybe it was too much too soon for my joints?  FYI the trail I use is dirt, so this isn't just a case of over-impact on asphalt.\n\nEither way do you think I should run through the pain, with the expectation that my joints will strengthen over time?  Or should I give them a few days to heal, so I don't risk injuring myself more seriously?\n\nThanks in advance for the advice.  I'm new to this subreddit and it looks to be a pretty cool place.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been fighting more, not speaking much, etc. \n\nWe had our prom and after-party on the 20th, and I tried not spending all my time with my other friend group as my girlfriend usually gets jealous. So anyway, I tried spending more time with her. I danced and apparently 'gripped' her hands and waist. I don't recall doing this hard, I just held affectionately (in my head, anyway). Move on to later to the after party and I want to be with her, naturally because she is my girlfriend. Obviously wasn't looking for sex or anything like that, I just enjoy being with her. So anyway, we all got drunk, partied etc. I stayed with her when she was passed out drunk to make sure she was alright, too. I just thought I was being a decent boyfriend, making her seem wanted and cared about.\n\nAnyway, flash forward to a couple days ago, and she says she (and her bestfriend) was 'scared' of me. I have always been quite possessive (she has, also, in fairness), but she says I was extremely possessive. I'm always described as a gentle giant by my friends and even her, and I've never visibly even got angry in front of her or my friends. I'd never dream of hurting her or anyone she cares about, either. I'm just really upset and don't know what to do.

I've convinced myself that this girl is either really into me or is simply using me for attention/whatever...

My ex and I broke up last December but we've also kept in touch every day; he recently wanted to get back together. The guy I'm talking to has a good way of knowing when I'm upset so I eventually told him and he insisted I cut off all contact with my ex. He pressured me in person into sending him a goodbye text and occasionally asks about him. It's hard for me to just go cold turkey on someone I've talked to every day for 5 years so when he finds out we still talk he turns a bit verbally aggressive. He has a right to be upset since we're actively aiming for a romantic relationship, but I've told him that I think he's being a bit pushy over the issue. In response, he cooled down and apologized, telling me he just wants me to try for us. Of course I totally understand why he would be upset over me still talking to an ex who wants to get back together with me, but I can't tell if his actions are a sign of being manipulative/aggressive. It might be too early to tell. \nAlso it's a little vague right now but I think he's a bit clingy. I've questioned it since we first started talking and he constantly asks if he's too clingy, too. But this too is hard to tell because I've never been in a relationship with someone who was really there for me, so I welcome all the attention he gives me. \n\nHonestly, normally I would walk away from this but I've never met someone I've had so much in common with before and who does so much for me and shows as much affection as him.

I (20m) have a history of depression and confidence issues, which has led to me having very little sexual experience and zero romantic experience (I've never even been on a date).\n\n During the summer, I was talking with a friend (lets call her D) who I've become rather attracted to, and in an enormous leap of faith, I asked her out. I've never asked anybody out in my entire life, and I was elated when she yes. We resolved to work out details when school resumes. We continued talking off and on, exchanging what I percieced as somewhat flirty messages.\n\nI should now mention that D (21F) is a bdsm practicioner, as is G, her ex. G (21 M) is our mutual friend. I've never tried it, but I'm curious. She messages me a month after the initial agreement, asking if I'd be play partner to both of them. I agree, thinking that G's presence would be in a mentoring capacity.\n\nLater on, I hear from G that they're going to get back together, leaving me unsure of where I stand. I realize me and D's prior agreement has been negated without my knowledge, which I feel hurt about, and I'm not sure if it was done intentionally or not.

Originally I only did it once, but I loved it so much I felt an actual compulsion to do it every time. \n\nI wore a bird suit...a suit of feathers, feathers as black and beautiful  as an eternal everlasting void.

When the delivery man put the pizza down, I screeched as loud as I could and ran across the lawn flapping my arms.  The delivery man cursed in astonishment and leaped backwards. As I ran towards him, arms flapping and head bobbing, I squawked loudly and shrieked \"Squuuuuuuuuuuak I'm a Pizza Bird! Pizza Bird! Squaaaaaaaaaaak!!!!\" When I got to the pizza I would peck the box and squawk until the delivery person left. \n\nI did this about 40 times in 2 months. 3 places banned me from delivery officially, but 4 others expressed annoyance and reservation about delivering to my home. \n\nI forced myself to stop when I accidentally made a new delivery woman cry from terror when I jumped out of a tree performing my Pizza Bird routine.

Anyways, it was an electrician who told me that he was changing the light fixture on my front porch (my apartment unit is in an old house) because my landlord thought the street corner was dark, and he told me that he had a key to get inside to check the wiring in the switch that I had to my outside porch light.   \n  I didn't think much of it, I just thought he was putting up a more modern, updated light fixture so I didn't really question it then. I get off of work that night, and when I get home there is a bright ass light on my porch. My neighbors were outside, so I thought maybe they installed a motion detector light. 2 hours later and the light never goes off, and I personally cannot turn it off because the electrician came into my apartment and put a flat plate over where my light switch used to be.  \n    I flipped my breaker, and the light is wired up to my electric, so my landlord is expecting me to pay for a dusk-to-dawn light to stay on allllllllll night every night because he thinks the street corner is dark at night.   \n    I normally receive a typed letter taped to my door 24 hours before something like this occurs for maintenance issues or anything else, but I never received anything for this.

We're currently long distance but that hasn't really proven to be much of an issue. Basically, he's always been an extremely quiet person and isn't in to talking that much. This really threw me off at the beginning of our relationship, I thought he was always mad or bored with me or something. I found myself holding back telling him things so we'd have something to talk about when we were together. \n\nEventually I guess I got used to it? It was certainly never happy about it but I guess I was just like 'whatever I don't have to deal with this now maybe he'll change or some shit'. He hasn't. \n\nSo we'll go to bars some times and he basically won't say anything the whole time, and I'll ask him how he is and he just responds with \"Fine, how are you?\" like it was some sort of greeting or some shit. Like I'm actually asking him how he is, why is this hard for him? And recently his brother passed away and he really has barely talked about it, and I try not to pressure him because obvs this is a really personal thing that I have no experience of. It's not like he's a stupid person or something--he definitely is thinking about things, he just never articulates them. It's making being with him progressively more difficult--it's very hard to be with someone when you can't support them (because you don't know what they need), they won't tell you what's going on in their life, and honestly I don't enjoy hanging out in silence. \n\nSo I guess have multiple questions: Why doesn't he talk? Am I ever going to get through to him or should I break up with him? Is there anything I can do to understand what's going on with him?

He was very clear that he did not mean he thought I was abusing her - he said that while I was critical and did ask for changes from her, my requests were \"well differentiated\" and didn't cross boundaries.  But he wants her to go to additional therapy on her own, with a female therapist.  He said she needs to decide if she can grow a thicker skin or if she needs to break up with me.\n\nMy girlfriend was pretty upset with his advice.

All of a sudden, this girl, completely serious and unaware that we were joking, starts divulging all of the details that led up to and included her first threesome. \n\nNow, I realize that some people are more casual about sharing their sex life and whatnot, but I could definitely tell that the alcohol played a large role in her sharing her experiences. What has me so hung up, though, was how she included the word FIRST!!! This girl came off as super innocent and certainly not the type of girl that would seemingly have a threesome (let alone more than once!), but I guess the quiet and innocent ones are the ones you need to watch out for!\nTL;DR:"}

You know that guy best-friend of yours who you get the somewhat sinister satisfaction of moulding? I'll be like him. Except I'll also be your mysterious european penpal, which is a bonus. Obviously I'm not expecting my correspondents to be the font of all womanly knowledge - but I hope I'll get some new perspectives.\n\nWhat will we uncover together? That my standards are too high?

I was gone in total for about 15 months. Of course, now myself and my girlfriend have caught the travel bug, and have spent the whole time since coming back saving up for another work visa trip in Australia. The problem is, anyone I've talked to at MSI (provincial healthcare) says that I have to live in the Canada for at least 5 years before I can live in another country again for a year or more and retain my healthcare coverage. This just seems wrong to me. Healthcare being one of the things that Canadians seem to take a lot of pride in, and it can be taken away for a few fits of wanderlust? I mean, I'm a Canadian citizen, I'm not obtaining citizenship somewhere else, it's just a visit (albeit a long one). I honestly thought the agent I talked to was full of shit, but I've had it repeated upon calling back. Does anybody else from Nova Scotia (or any other province for that matter) have this problem? Are they full of shit? Or if not, should I just not tell them I'm leaving, what would be the repercussions?  I know of Canadians, though not first-hand and not from Nova Scotia, who have taken several long trips abroad within short periods of time... does everyone who does so have this problem? Can they really stop my coverage?\nTL;DR:"}

Very few times have I ever felt anything for them, but I have had the feeling of infatuation towards a few- never lasting long, burning out quick. I understand I'm young but it's becoming insulting to hear \"give it time, you're still young\" I'm more emotionally intelligent than most married couples... Been on some amazing dates, romantic moments and treated like a king, but all I feel is this almost shallow or empty feeling. I'll give an example of this guy/28 I met and was in the company of for about 3 months: We met over drinks and enjoyed nice conversation- clicked very nicely, awesome sex, awesome communication, got the type of affection I need (petting, physical) but all that time was in vain really, he thought we were going somewhere and asked me in a corny but sweet way to be his boyfriend and I declined. He was in tears and asked me \"Why? You asshole! You don't even look like you care!\" \"piece of shit!\" But that's my fault, I didn't have any feelings for him like that, I should have seen the signs that he was falling but I just indulged him I guess, till it blew up in my face and tried to be honest. Now I spend my time hooking up with randoms, most want to see me again because they \"like\" me I tell them not to expect more from me. But why? Why don't I have more? Why is it when people start to have feeling for me is when I realize the most that I never had feeling for them?\n\nI need someone to talk to about this- no one I know has been able to help me, haven't asked best friend but I doubt she'll have the insight to resolve this (I don't mean this in a mean way, shes honestly my life)\nTL;DR:"}

This is a place that has been operational for some time and I have purchased from several times in the past. I purchased the items online as they are out of state.\nAfter not receiving the items for over a week I checked to see if I had been charged, which I had. When I checked my order status online it said it was processing, so I sent them an email asking for the order status- no response. I had a busy week, so I didn't think about it until a week later. Sent another email- no response.\nThis is when I attempted to call them and I found all their phones have been disconnected. I did some googling at this point and found that the store had closed sometime around the time I made the order. Evidently loads of people were ripped off and there are several news articles about it.\nThe thing is, their web site is still functional. You can still go there and buy something, and presumably never get it. This feels like blatant fraud/theft to me.\nSo my question is, is there anything I can do to secure a refund or at least make sure this person doesn't get away with this? Is this criminal or civil? I have already filed a complaint with the BBB. The purchase was less than $100, so not worth hiring a lawyer...\nTL;DR:"}

This was going on up until today, getting worse each day, and today it was break up ba bam. I feel like her friends had some influence on her decision though.\n\nShe told me how she wasn't sure if she wanted to continue the relationship because she simply lost interest about 3 weeks ago, coincidence? I could see she wasn't interested; not answering my texts, and overall the relationship became one-sided, and she basically avoided me. So when she told me that she simply lost interest without reasoning, (\"Its natural\"), it felt like she dropped me once she got tired of me, kinda like a toy. I don't feel horrible, breakup-wise since I saw it coming 2 weeks ago, just feel used really, which is the sad feeling. I was more mad/annoyed that she didn't talk about her feelings with me beforehand, and felt like she pretty much lead me on since then. I talked about the situation with two of my close girl friends, one said that Emily lost interest, the other one said that Emily was nervous. She was going to uni faraway, which was a good reason, in my mind, why she broke up, so I won't be holding her back. However two days ago we talked about us, since she was acting differently, and she said she wanted to stay together after summer...ouch. \n\nShe was a super nice person, so when I asked do you want to end this relationship today, she immediately answered yes. Got whip-lashed by the sudden and sure response, it took a second or two to register since she never acted this way. What really annoyed me was how she straight up avoided me rather than fix the problem.\n\nI don't really know what to do as of now, besides motivate myself to be a better me. Any advice? Thanks for reading too, needed to vent out a bit.\nTL;DR:"}

The major problem in my life currently is my mother. to make this a little shorter I will say that she has had an extremely rough life all around. Coupled with her abusive childhood she was diagnosed with cancer 5 years ago and has been battling with several reoccurrences. This is why I choose to stick around and not give up. My mother is very mean to me and started being cruel when I started high school. She says thing to me like \"You can't wait for me to die\" and \"I hope you fucking drop dead\" on a daily basis, she scratches me and hits me and hits me with things if I do things with my family. She does not like my fathers side of the family (The only family I know) and yells at me if I try to have a relationship or visit them. She claims I \"Left her when she was dying\" and that when I come home I don't spend time with her, but its because I can't stand to be at home in my small apartment and get abused. She really brings me down and I am done trying Everything I do is not good enough. Her excuse for everything is that she is sick and dying but even when I do spend time with her I devote my whole day, she does not wake up until 1pm and leave the house until 5pm.

So we have been together about 2 months officially and its long distance. We still have the moments of lovely dovey which is something that both of us enjoy, but as of recent both of us have had a bit of stress on us. Starting off with me it was hard for me to sometimes have fun doing stuff together, not because of her, just because of my current situation that I was in. Now with her she is stressed out and she said she needs some space. Before this we spent about three and a half months straight talking every day all day, now she wants more time with her friends(which is ok by me) because she has had to end relationships based on controlling boyfriends and people who have wanted all of her time. I just want to know if this is normal behavior. Sorry I couldn't be more descriptive about this, including personality but I will update tonight answering questions about the type of people we are.

She has always been kinda \"new age friendly\", and this guy is a reiki master, does biomagnetism, the whole package, so she fell hard for him. They were pretty happy together, and 4 months into the relationship they decided to have a baby.\n \n\nIt was all pretty cool, he was always talking how now we were a family, that it was gonna be great to have a baby, yadda yadda yadda. Until last week, when, out of nowhere, he told her that he didn't loved her anymore and that he had a new girl. We were pretty shocked, and while my mom suspected the girl had a thing for him (they are co-workers, he's a teacher at a local highschool, and she saw them together a couple times while going to pick him up), she never thought he also had a thing for her. \n\nAfter the initial shock, we were expecting him to move out, but he had a talk with my mother and says it's best for the baby that he sticks around, in case he's needed for a run to the hospital (she has been passing out at least twice a month), and now my mother is confused, letting him stay for a couple days.\n\nSo here we are, the \"I can get you to the hospital\" thing is bullshit since she has plenty of friends and family to spend this month with, starting with me, but when I point this out to her she starts avoiding the subject, since she still loves him and hopes she can make him come back to her. So I would love to hear some objective opinions on the subject, because I think it's awful for her and the baby to be under this kind of pressure with the a--hole in the house, but who knows, I'm biased by the amount of hate I feel right now.\nTL;DR:"}

The only reason I am around C often is because we all run in the same group of friends. M constant badgering about C seemed so unnecessary. M was constantly worrying about if we spoke, what we talked about, and other things. M said that C made him nervous because he claimed that C always went after the girls he was into and ruined it for him. It seems M is at the end of his rope with C and he can't take it anymore. The only way I can explain their friendship is using the word frenemies, constantly throwing digs at one another, but have tons of history together. Fast forward to the to the bar this last Saturday. C takes me aside tells me he has feelings for me and later that night tries to kiss me. I tell him that the conversation is inappropriate and that I am not interested in him. When I am back with M later that night he asked if any funny business went on. I lied and said no. Later in the weekend M and I decide we are no longer going to be together. He basically apologizes about overreacting and taking the C thing to far. The entire time all I can think is his he was completely justified to be worried about C, yet our entire group of friends is taking C's side about M overreacting. If I tell M what went on that night he would be furious, confront C, and lose all his friends because unfortunately they will take C's side. Do I tell M what happened? We aren't going to date so in removing myself he would keep all his friends. If I told him he would completely go ape shit on C.\nTL;DR:"}

She finds regularly working out a lot harder to motivate herself for. I invite her to the gym every single time I go, and she always says no, but then she tells me that the way I look makes her feel bad about herself. I don't know how to handle this, reddit, and it is escalating. She was crying to me about this last night, and it is \nsomething that she brings up more and more, and I don't know what to tell her.\nTL;DR:"}

She was a year old at that time, and spent her entire life (until rescue) in a puppy mill.  She's adorable, sweet, super timid, very submissive, not aggressive in the least.  \n\nOver the months, she's opened up to me - but not my husband - and she's actually a super goofy dog.  She plays with our other dog (almost 4 years old), gets along with the cats, loves to run outside, does great on a leash!  \n\nBut my husband?  Nope.  Terror barking *all the time*, no matter how hard he tries, no matter how much he interacts with her.  She's terrified of him.  \n\nAnd at night?  HA!  I haven't had a solid night's sleep since we got her in June.  I'm just a *little* tired at this point.  Just a little.  I don't need more than 2 hours of sleep at a time or anything.  =/   Doesn't matter if we crate her, let her roam - she does not sleep through the night.\n\nSo we talked to the vet.  The vet gave us Shen Calm, which is a powder, and we're supposed to give her 1/2 scoop, twice a day.  After a week, we up it to a full scoop twice a day.  \n\nWe're on day 2.  I don't expect this shit to work.  I expect this to be a $40 waste that probably just upsets her stomach and further destroys our carpet.\nTL;DR:"}

We are both very much in love with each other and we love each other as well (acknowledging the difference). I'd say we do not fight very often if at all. However, when we do have a confrontation, it is usually because she seems sad about something and I try to ask what's going on. She doesn't talk about anything without me bringing it up. So after gently trying to get her to talk to me about something for a bit, she responds and tells me what is wrong. It is usually simple enough and I am usually at fault for the problem, but the reason she feels sad is because she blames herself.\n\nOther confrontation emerges when I am upset about something and bring it up. I am more forward when there is something I feel is off. Not angry or upset or worked up at all, I just calmly bring it up. When I do this, she usually blames herself completely and apologizes a lot. This makes it hard to talk to her, because often times I am partially at fault. But all she does is apologize and tell me she will be better, and I don't feel like we get anywhere. She isn't brushing it aside, because she doesn't care.

I myself don't mind staying at a hotel which offers all inclusive, but my generall impression is that hotels such as this are often a bit away from central areas - and that im therefore risking spending 2 weeks mostly with people in their 60s.  \n\n**Length**: 14-16 days. \n\n**Budget**: Approx: 1800 - 2300 USD per person. \n\n**Climate**: Warm and nice. Tropical is fine by us.  :) \n\nI think the bottom line of what im asking for is this: Could any one recommend a destination which there are all inclusive hotels, but also a social scene/area where younger people/backpackers travel too?\nTL;DR:"}

We known each other for 6 years but been friends for bout 2 1/2 years. There is interest coming from both me and her. We have held hands, kissed and done [other things] but i'm not sure how to go about it. I had a crush on her for years but I was to chickenshit to asked because I was scared of hurting her (emotionally) and I reside myself to try and stop feeling for her that way but eventually I just couldn't do it and asked her.\n\nI'm using this as a opportunity to know her better (that's what dates are for right?).

I just asked her out for a third date, and we're going out on this Saturday.\n\nSo, things seem pretty good. We have good conversations, and both dates lasted a while (4 hours for the first and 2.5 hours for the second).\n\nWe haven't really gotten physical at all (like we haven't held hands or anything like that, and we just hugged on the first date). Still, we've hung out for less than a week, so I'm not really worried about that too much.\n\nThe problem is that I seem to be the one who initiates things (I asked her out for all three dates), and she seems to have her guard up sometimes. Some of our conversations have gotten into personal subjects, so it's not like she doesn't feel somewhat comfortable around me. But, I can't tell how quickly we \"should\" be moving forward.\n\nI guess she got out of a long-term relationship about 4 months ago (I'm pretty sure her ex broke up with her). So maybe she just needs to take things really slowly to build up confidence again? She seems like a confident person, but maybe she's just afraid of getting too close for now?\n\nI've been in a few long-term relationships, but they usually either move a lot more slowly (unlike here, where we'll have 3 dates in one week), or much more quickly physically (like, sleeping with the gal in the first couple of weeks).\n\nMy question is this: How do I know if she wants to keep moving forward, or if she's just agreeing to dates because I keep asking?\nTL;DR:"}

Here, I plan to bump up my credits per semester to about 21. I will attend Spring, Summer, and possible Fall semesters here until I get my associates, which I will then attempt to transfer to UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara). There, I plan to do the same thing; take an extremely large amount of credits per semester to graduate as soon as possible.\n\nMy question is this: Has anyone gone to any of the two latter schools?

I wonder if I am wording things wrong?  Can anyone give me some advice as to how to get him to open up about this?\n\nI know part of the problem is that he's scared about graduating college and how he's going to find a job and I think that is a block for him, he can't see past that fear so he locks up.\n\nAlso, on a side note, he gets frustrated easily.  I think he has some mild anger problems and when something upsets him I get the brunt end of it (I imagine because I am the only person he feels like showing these emotions to) but he doesn't understand that this isn't fair to me and when I try to explain he locks up and assumes I'm accusing him of being a shitty boyfriend. \n\nI do think he needs to open up more, but I think that somewhere along the lines I am failing with communication.  I feel like the way I communicate with him has to have something to do with how he is reacting, am I right?\n\nI believe in making this relationship work and I know he does too, so I want to find away to break through this communication failure.  I'm not looking to break up with him (unless I find out we don't want the same things out of life) I am looking to make our relationship better.\nTL;DR:"}

We had our silences, well it wasn't uncomfortable, more like the fact that we had nothing to say. There was no intentional physical contact although he doesn't recoil if we accidentally had some. \n\nHe made me laugh, and I made him laugh sometimes. I don't think I felt a spark, but I am attracted to him. Whenever he speaks, he makes strong and intense eye contact, but I can't read his eyes at all. (is that a sign? haha)\n\nHe was surprised that I never had a bf before though. \n\nIt was weird and from what I know, he detest \"teenager relationships\". He sent me a text asking if I got home.

Two weeks before our first appointment, he calls me out of the blue and says he doesn't want to do it anymore and wants to break up. I was shocked. 1) because I thought he wanted to work on things and he was the one who brought up counselling, and 2) because he was breaking up with me over the phone. \n\nI mean, that's pretty shitty, right? I feel like if you're in a relationship for 6 years, the least you can do is break up with your partner face-to-face. We live in the same city. \n\nI'm pretty hurt and, on one hand, this is a person I spent a quarter of my life with, so I feel like it's crappy on my part if I just forget he exists and refuse to speak to him again. On the other hand, HE BROKE UP WITH ME OVER THE PHONE. AFTER 6 YEARS. Am I overreacting or is that just unacceptable? I'm not mad over the break-up - if he wants out, that's fine - but the method stills bothers me.\nTL;DR:"}

What can I (30F) do to help?\nPOST: I really need some advice. My boyfriend and I have been living together for about 9 months now.  He was laid off in the first week of October. Since then I think we've had sex once. I've brought it up a few times and he just said he doesn't feel confident and mostly gets quiet and seems sad.  Then in turn I felt bad so I have mostly stopped saying anything because it hurts to be turned down.  Otherwise, he is very affectionate. We kiss, hug, hold hands etc. all the time. I'm struggling with if I should just be happy with that and find a way to swallow my ginormous sex drive somehow or if there is just no hope. \n\nAs a background, before we moved in together I thought we had a pretty good sex life and he seemed very attracted to me.  Since we moved in together it slowed way down and now there is nothing. He says that since he makes less money than me and now none, he feels very stressed and it has killed his libido.  I guess since this issue didn't matter much before we moved in together I didn't realize he would feel this badly.  I try to be as supportive as possible. I have never intentionally made him feel bad. I don't care about how much money he makes. But it's starting to be that I feel bad that I'm doing well and that's not very fair. I don't know what to do to fix things or if I can.\n\nSorry if this is rambling!

I had just purchased and engagement ring and was planning on purposing in the next couple of weeks.

She said I was perfect and everything but that she needed to figure herself out before she could be in a relationship.  \n\nShe is 23, 24 in Oct.  She has always lived at home simply due to circumstances.  She has been looking for a real job, currently a barista, but she wants to work in social services and the job opportunities are very limited.  She said she has always relied on other people for her happiness and to take care of things for her and she wants to do that for her self.  She wants independence which I understand but don't want to accept.  \n\nI still feel like she is my soul mate and this will allow her to mature and grow as an individual which was my only complaint with her while dating (immaturity at times).  \n\nI guess I want to know if anybody else has experienced something similar and if you ended back up with the person you left or not.  Also, if you can relate to her and give me some insight into how she is thinking for my own piece of mind.  I know people will break up for years then end up back together and it may simply be blind hope to keep my emotions in check but I truly truly believe we will end up together.  I have been through other break ups and have never thought that so being this sure of something after just being dumped is a new feeling for me.\nTL;DR:"}

He goes to the hospital to check it out, the ER to be specific.\nOfficer in front asks him if he has Ebola [big scare back then (in October)] -- irrelevant, just thought I'd share. Anyway, he is sent in after waiting for thirty minutes. Nurse asks him what he has, he replies that he had a tick, pulled it out, and just needs to check out if everything is okay.

I'm desperate and looking for some advice about eye infections in cats. \n\nSo a little background, about 2 months ago my cat Gibson developed some kind of eye infection. I hoped it would go away on its own but after a few days I decided to take him to the vet. My vet never saw an ulcer or a lesion of any kind but he had a really bad entropion, so we began treating him with various eye drops, be it anti-bacterial, anti-viral or anything else that may help. \n\nFast forward a month and after weekly visits and changes to his medications and we've seen no improvements. We decide to board him at the vet's office for better more consistent treatment. After 10 days they send him home and decide that if his eye isn't looking better in a week that the doctor will tack his eye to make sure the entropion does not effect the healing of his eye. \n\nWelp a week later there had been some improvement but the vet didn't think it was enough so we begin the eye surgery. The doctor sent Gibson home last week with an E collar to keep him from messing with his stitches. I had to go out of town for a few days for school. I made sure my best friend and roommate were able to take care of and medicate him properly while I was gone. \n\nFinally, I get back today and examine Gibson's eye. He is keeping the infected eye open more for sure which is great but he was displaying severe depressed-like behavior. I take off the cone and that's when I notice he is not opening his good eye anymore. I peel it open and it appears that there is now another entropion in what was his good eye. \n\nI am completely lost and feel helpless that after treating him or 2 months and spending close to or more than a thousand dollars that he is really not getting much better.

She had mentioned him maybe twice in passing saying shed gotten together with him and a couple other friends. \n\nOk so I sort of wish id read more now just because I don't know if there was cheating or if it was just an inappropriate text message.

I also don't really feel like I can trust her anymore.  \n\nOh one last thing we had said to each other that either one of us could go through the other ones phone if they wanted to.

He's really great and is one of the most responsible and sweetest person i've met. \nim used to dating really terrible guys who really treat me bad and I can honestly say hes the first guy i've dated that's actually awesome and motivating.\nthe only problem is that he finds any excuse not to have sex or even touch me or kiss. from oh you smoke I cant kiss you (when this didn't bug him in the beginning) to i'm tired and I don't want to touch your boob (sorry for the tmi). whenever I try to initiate anything he'll have some excuse like I have a headache or saying \"later ok?\" or my family is home (even when they're not).\nso now we only do it about once a week and when we do its not like he even cares about how im feeling and its really boring. and we spend a lot of time together so im just very confused because he makes me feel unloved.\n\nI've tried to bring it up to him but he just uses the same excuses. when we first started dating we did it all the time and It was more wild but now its just always missionary and about 10 minutes.\n\ntheres been a few instances of E.D. so maybe he is embaressed about that. but I dont understand why that would make him want to stop kissing me too. \n\nalso I know he likes spending time with me because he always tells me to come over or takes me out for dinner or on a date but he just doesn't want to go further then that anymore and im really feeling unloved and ugly.\n\nbasically I want to know if some guys are just not into sex as much as my ex's probably were and also how I should bring this up to him without making him uncomfortable. \nin the past I said \"baby is everything ok? I feel like you don't like me anymore\" and would respond I love you and get annoyed with me and say that hes just not a very cuddly person...\nTL;DR:"}

I also had no job lined up and no friends or family here. \n\nIn the past two years i have learnt a decent amount of the language, but i still find it very hard to speak in social groups. It is to hard for me to follow the conversation, and i need time to think of what to say myself. I have managed to get a good job and i am earning reasonable money as a teacher here. But now i feel like i have plateaued in what i can achieve here. \n\nAlso i have no real friends here and no family here. Not speaking French when i arrived meant i could never get to know anyone. And my job also means i work late most nights of the week. I spend my evenings with my computer or watching tv with my gf. And i feel so lonely.\n\nAnother problem is my gf seems to make no effort to move her life forwards. In two years i have worked my way into a good position financially. She has been unemployed for a year. I workout, she is putting on weight. She has no ambition in life, and refuses to help herself. I think about the sacrifices i made to come to her country, and what i have achieved. And then i think about all the advantages she has and the lack of effort she is making.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Ever helped in an emergency situation and then disappear quickly after? Story is inside.\nPOST: I once was waiting for a bus outside a big downtown mall, having a smoke. There's a little sort of alcove off the side of the doorway and me and a guy wearing a security guard uniform were standing about 30 feet apart. Around the corner, in the security guards blind spot a large, 6'3' guy in a floral print shirt steps over and hits the guy with a haymaker. The guard collapsed straight back, like a board being pushed over. I walked around the floral print guy as he ran off, screaming. I went over the guard and sat there with him as I called 911 and advised him to lay still, not move. A few minutes later an ambulance and police officers arrived. By this time there were a dozen people hanging around. As the paramedics helped the guard I told the police my part of the story about what happened. I then noticed my bus was coming and took off, forgetting the incident.\n\nMaybe three weeks later I was walking downtown a few blocks from the site and I heard someone yelling at me. I took my headphones out and saw the security guard running up to me. We stood there talking for a few minutes and he explained to me that he remembered nothing of the incident, except my face. We ended up talking for a while, he was a student from somalia who was a guard part time. Thankfully, he had no permanent damage, and we're buddies now. Love to hear any other amazing stories too!\nTL;DR:"}

The thought of it makes me sick.  The debt added onto the backs of families, the materialistic nature of it all and the danger associated with having over-weight Americans fight over a cheap TV.  However, it isn't really like that at all. Sure, the corporations make quite a bit of money, but they are going to regardless.  That isn't inherently a bad thing.  For the most part, they provide goods that us, the consumer, wants/needs.  That's an open market, no biggie.  \n\nMy experience this morning:  I woke up at 730 to drive down the street to the nearest Staples.  I've been wanting (yes, wanting, not needing) an Olympus Pen camera for about 6 months.  I'd done my research, asked around and decided to wait it out.  I wanted to see if I could save some cash on an item I knew I was already going to purchase.  The deal wasn't great, but I got a few freebies along with  my camera for the same price.  \n\nI entered Staples around 7:45 and the big crowds were still there.  However, there wasn't shoving, yelling, pushing or anything even remotely close to that.  Most of the shoppers simply walked around the store, picking up the goods they wanted and headed to the register.  If someone needed some space to walk around, everyone obliged and moved without incident.  It took about 20 minutes to get through the line and make my painless transaction.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with that?  I don't understand this blind hatred towards Black Friday?\nTL;DR:"}

Now after stooping to the new low of snooping I didn't catch him in his lie today, but caught his huge lie from about 5 months ago.  I feel like shit for snooping.  I know its awful.

I am laying in bed next to him sick to my stomach with anger and hurt and I can't even tell him because I only found out by snooping.  I think I married a compulsive liar.

They went out when I was away for the summer but broke up after like three weeks because of reasons I won't get into here. \n\nHe really hurt her (he had sex with her then promptly broke up with her.

He texts her all the time, and a lot of the time its when I'm with her. \n\nI just have no idea what to do. He's a genuinely likable guy and he's cool to hang out with. I don't think he understood how badly he hurt her (she was his first real gf), so it's hard for me to be angry at him. On the flip side, I don't like her talking to her ex, even if he was our friend.

He began stalking her, and she got a restraining order in her state. That order expired, but she moved to another state for graduate school, which is the state where I met her and we got married after dating for several years. We were under the impression that the stalker didn't know what state we lived in, although we did know that he was continuing to stalk other women (my wife was contacted by the lawyer of another girl he was stalking a couple years ago to make a statement; we don't know what came of that) and he occasionally sent a rambling, bizarre letter disconnected from reality to my wife's parents who still live in the same state as the stalker. This was annoying, but it was occasional, and we've pretty much ignored it.\n\nThe problem now is that wife received a letter in the mail recently from the stalker that had our home address on it. It did include a return address for the stalker.\n\nThe question is, what legal options, if any, do we have?

She said she was going to go take a shower and I could check Facebook/email/whatever on her laptop while she did so.\n\nInternet was already open on the laptop and there were a lot of tabs open, one of which was Reddit so I went and clicked on that one. It was logged into a throwaway account so being curious I clicked on the username. I found that she had posted to several GW-like subs, with posts dating to the beginning of our relationship (which is a year and a half long now) to the last couple of days. They weren't extremely explicit photos, but were pictures of her naked breasts, butt, or her in her underwear. This bothered me greatly because first of all, all of this was done without my knowledge. And also, it just makes me feel so weird to know that other guys out there are looking at my girlfriend's naked body. So then I clicked onto her messages, found a lot of guys sending her all kinds of creepy PMs telling her what they want to do to her, etc. From what I could tell she didn't reply to any of these. \n\nSo I confronted her about it after dinner. I told her how it made me feel that she was putting naked pictures of herself on the internet, allowing other guys to see her naked and not telling me about it. She apologized, said that it was wrong of her not to tell me, but it is her own body and she's not cheating on me or anything. We talked about it for a while, and ultimately didn't really come to a conclusion on it. Ideally I would like for her to stop doing this. But she believes that she should be able to do what she wants with her body so long as she is not physically cheating on me with these guys or even talking to them at all.  I've never been in this kind of situation before and I don't really know what to do. I need advice either on how to convince her to stop doing it, or how to just be okay with it because is she really doing anything wrong? Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

Help!\nPOST: So...\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years now, and we have known each other for 3 years. We met over Internet and he lived 30 miles from me, but moved to my city for university. We were in love when we lived far away from each other, but officially got into a relationship after he moved here. We are great together, we share a lot of interests and love the same food and similar important stuff, so moving together would be awesome, wouldn't it?\n\nBut. He is very used to clean spaces, while I was raised in a white trash family of 9 with stains everywhere and a rundown house. I learned to ignore messes and I have become better at being clean, but I do acknowledge being a bit messy. That is a small issue.\n\nThe bigger issue is that I am a huge introvert. I just want everyone to fuck off after a long day at university and stare at my screen for a couple of hours. My boyfriend is the opposite. After a long day, he wants to cuddle with me and kiss me and have sex and talk a lot and be affectionate. Thankfully, I have managed to not become irritated at him for this because we only hang out about 4 days a week, but I know that it would strain me horribly if this would happen DAILY.\n\nI am scared of us not being compatible, because I see how rejected he feels when I try to create some space after a long day, but I don't know what to do about it! I have no issues with being affectionate all the time during weekends or other free days, but god I hate being social after a day at work.\n\nHow can I mention this issue and maybe solve this issue without hurting his feelings? Can I change in any way? How can I become a less messy person when I do not see the stains or dirt?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskDocs\nTITLE: Prolonged throat discomfort (several years) now accompanied by strange structures in phlegm.\nPOST: First I am a 29 year old white male, 5'11\" and about 200 lbs right now. I take no medications and have no known allergies to plants or food. I have had throat irritation accompanied by increased/constant mucus production starting sometime around June of 2012. The mucus is generally clear although it can be speckled with green or white blobs depending probably based on if I have a mild infection or whatever. The mucus is very viscus and sticky (it can be kind of blobby) and has a salty flavor. It feels like I have something resting on the back of my throat that can be moved around by attempting to clear my throat or by repeated swallowing but never really goes away. I have gone to both my doctor and looked at acid reflux, anxiety, and finally went to a specialist to get my throat scoped with no results and a final diagnosis of globus hystarious or something along those lines, so basically it was imagined. The sensation and markedly increased mucus production has never gone away.\n\nTwo months ago I coughed up a very odd piece of phlegm which was clear with some bits of white kind of like usual, however it had a very springy and durable white coiled structure in it about an inch long and maybe the width of a .5 pencil lead when not stretched. At first it almost looked segmented like a worm or something but I don't know. I passed it off as nothing because it could easily be a one off that my body made via fluke or whatever. However it has happened twice more since then and I am thinking it has something to do with my condition.\nI have taken a picture of it but the quality is somewhat poor. It was hard to get the camera to focus on it.\n\n \n\nIs this something to be concerned about? I haven't been able to find anything about coiled mucus structures in phlegm so I am kind of at a loss. Side note; it lost all springyness/stretchyness after sitting out while I was writing this.\nTL;DR:"}

This doesn't come naturally to me.\nPOST: My wife and I have been happily married for almost 10 years. I'm an easygoing guy, and my wife has always been assertive and stubborn--a relationship dynamic that we have approached with respect and that has served us well. However, we've been exploring some BDSM play over the past year or so, and my wife finds that she *really* loves being dominated, and not just on a sexual level. It's an intense source of comfort and stress relief for her, and she has begun to crave it both in and out of the bedroom. \n\nMy problem is that she expects it *at all times*, and she gets upset when she feels like I'm not being assertive enough. \n\nI don't know how to explain the way this makes me feel. It's a mixture of embarrassment and frustration, I suppose. Like I explained above, I'm not an alpha male by nature, and I've always been comfortable in that skin. I like being a dom in the bedroom sometimes and occasionally putting my foot down in the real world. But I don't know if I can play that role 24/7. I'm not Christian Grey or Gideon Cross or whoever-the-hell. \n\nSo I ask: Should I explore this lifestyle and try to acclimate myself to a permanent dom-role because it means so much to my wife? Is she being unfair or unreasonable? Should I push back? Am I being spineless about all this?\nTL;DR:"}

Long time lurker, first time poster. I need a bit of advice. \n\nI have been with my boyfriend for 2 years now. We've lived together since about February, and I feel like we've hit a bit of a rut. We both work typical normal work hours (8-5), and once we're done with work during the week we go home, put the TV on, and watch it until bed. This has become routine. At first, I had NO problem with this - we both work, I go to graduate school at night, so we're both exhausted by 6:00 PM. The trouble is, I'm starting to notice that it feels as though we're living the same day over and over again - we don't really have in-depth conversations like we used to anymore, we just zone out in front of the TV until we go upstairs to pass out. \n\nOn the weekends, we usually get out and do things since we have the time and energy to do so, but during the week our conversation is a minimum. I cook us dinner, we make a few comments throughout whatever TV show or movie we're watching, we go up to bed, and pass out. Our sex life has taken a bit of a hit too - I have a HL, while he's always had more of a LL than me, but now we only have sex about once every 2-3 weeks. \n\nI love my boyfriend very much, and I know that he cares about me, but I don't know how to get us out of this rut.

I eat meals with people in my class and occasionally study with someone in my class.  Other than that, I find myself with no one to hand out with, sometimes due to my limited free time.  I often spend days going to class, work, meetings then staying in my room or studying by myself. This makes sense, as the college I'm attending is quite prestigious and I have a high workload, but I can't help but feel lonely and jealous of my friends and bf who are always hanging out with people at their school.

The industries I'm trying to get hired in are downsizing, and I have little to no experience (I took paid jobs instead of unpaid internships during my college summers). This being the case, I was absolutely ecstatic when I got home two nights ago, turned on my phone (which had died a few hours earlier) and had a voice mail from a company looking to get me in for an interview. My phone volume was low, so I turned it up and tried to press the button to repeat the message. However, my phone is a bit old, and the touch sensors are a little off...so I accidentally deleted the message. This wouldn't be a problem except that my phone, like so many others I assume, does not record missed calls if it's turned off- only messages.\n\nAll I have is the area code (Sacramento, CA). Yesterday I tried contacting our phone provider and got access to the list of incoming calls on my phone number, and there was no trace of said area code.

We had a customer service department that made up about 8 people; all female.  They were all very nice to me (after all, I always fixed their problems), except for one.  She really wasn't nice to anybody.  You probably know the type.... overbearing, always thinking her problem was more critical than others, harrassing you by calling you 10 times in 30 minutes because you hadn't dropped what you were doing and run over to her computer immediately.  That kind of stuff.\n\nAnyhow, it was an easy enough job and I usually had free time to conjure up ideas of how to pay people back that messed with me too much.  I also worked later hours than most so I could \"work\" uninterrupted.\n\nThis particular lady always complained about little stuff; very little stuff.  That's how I got my idea.  After the CS dept left for the day, I started going over to her desk and would do things like (carefully) break the lead in her pencil. I would try to do it where the break was inside the wood area.  She would try to write with it and the tip would snap off.  I would do this to every pencil in her desk.  I also would take the cartridge of staples out of her stapler, drop a small drop of super glue on the under side of the staple cartridge, let it dry and put it back in.  Her stapler would jam and she would curse.  I would also dip the end of her pens in the super glue and let it dry.  Then when she tried writing with them, they wouldn't and she would throw them away and order new ones.\n\nAfter about two months of this, I overheard that she had gotten yelled at by management for \"excessive use of office supplies\".  She remained a bitter person, but it was satisfying to listen to her complain all the time about how shitty the company's office supplies were.  \n\nIt was the \"perfect\" revenge.\nTL;DR:"}

I moved out of our apartment in South Carolina where we were living at the time, to NYC to start completely over. \n\nI didn't talk to him for three months while living in NYC and after some cooling off, we decided to see if we could repair things. We have been working through things since and we decided to move back in together 1 year after our break up (Nov. 2015). \n\nThis morning, we woke up and were both looking at our phones next to each other when I see he received a text from a female friend that said \"I miss you too\". I asked him if I could see their thread and he passed his phone over and it showed he texted her at 12:05 a.m. \"Miss you\" with the emoji with tears coming from its nose, and about a week ago, he wrote her a message a 1:26 a.m. saying \"Thinking of you and miss you\".

I don't care if you're guy, girl or whatever- you do NOT get to make passes at my guy! I can't tell if my boyfriend is oblivious, if he likes the attention or what. For simplicity's sake, we'll call his gay friend B. B will send my boyfriend like 20 unsolicited messages a day- messages that are very clearly not platonic. B will say things like \"thinking of you :*\" \"we should definitely hang out more ;)\" \"**what are you wearing?**\" What the actual fuck?  I was going through my boyfriend's instagram photos last night and B has liked and commented on **every single photo.** It's disturbing. Sometimes my boyfriend will post workout photos to whore for likes or whatever and B is always the first comment with some awkward emoticon shit. Yesterday my boyfriend and I were clubbing and I swear to god I saw B trying to follow us.\n\nDo I go to my boyfriend with this? I've been paying attention to B for a few weeks now and I am positive B is sexually interested in my boyfriend. My boyfriend has problems with checking his text messages so he will only reply to like 4 of B's messages a week but I know he reads at least half of them. B and my boyfriend aren't super close friends or anything. However, they do have the same friend groups. In my ideal world, my boyfriend would cut B out of his life (block him on whatever) and I wouldn't have to worry about any of this.  I don't know if it's OK for me to ask my boyfriend to do that though. I've heard some horrific stories about girls coming between \"bros\". Am I in the right here? I have all of the passwords to my boyfriend's shit so I can post more messages if it helps. I know my boyfriend is objectively attractive physically but I am not ok with this random dude basically stalking him.\nTL;DR:"}

We sat next to each other on the first day  since neither of us didn't know anyone else there, so naturally we started talking. We have been sitting next to each other since then, chatting about various things and it feels really natural talking to her even though I usually have trouble talking to women. \n\nThe main issue is that she has a pretty busy schedule in school and but I'd love to get to know her better. The fact that she seems genuinely nice and is really pretty makes me feel like I will be beating myself up if I don't act on this. But I'm a really hesitant about asking her out as we don't really know each other that well.\n\nI feel as this might be a really stupid thing to do, but it's eating away at me and I feel like I want to break my habits a bit and act on my feelings for once. But I'd really appreciate some input from an outsider. This is slowly driving me crazy and I really don't know what to do!\nTL;DR:"}

I was out on my balcony enjoying the nice weather with a mug of hot green tea, a big glass of ice water, my phone with a plethora of reddit to read, and a citronella candle to keep away the bugs. Quite the pleasant evening if you ask me. \n\nAfter an hour or so outside, duty called. I headed to the bathroom to take care of business so I could get back to my post outside. Approximately three minutes later I heard a frantic banging on my door accompanied by muffled screams. I recognized the urgency of the pounding so I jumped up and got to the door without even wiping. \n\nBefore I fully open the door my neighbor started running through my apartment holding a bucket of water and yelling, \"YOUR BALCONY IS ON FIRE!\" As he scurried to the back I went to the fridge and grabbed my large Brita tank of water and demonstrated my vast diction muttering, \"fuck fuck fuck fucking shit fuck fuck fuck fucking fuck...\" \n\nLuckily my neighbor caught the fire early and was able to put it out before I even got there. I never leave candles unattended but the one time it slipped my mind I almost burned down my home. I'm not sure how I could sit next to a candle for so long and then be betrayed by it after only minutes alone but it happened.\n\nSo there I stood. Panicked, embarrassed, relieved, thankful, and with a shitty ass. The damage isn't bad, only a few boards to replace which I will have no problem fixing. It could have ended so much worse though. I've been saving up to move across the country in a few months and without renters insurance I could have been screwed to the max. \n\nEven if he hated me I'm sure he would have helped me put out the fire but let this be a lesson to all. Always be kind to your neighbors, they may end up saving your life. As a thank you I bought him some good Great Lakes Brewery beer and a pack of his favorite smokes. I also told him I owe him a emergency fire extinguishing to which he replied, \"That won't be necessary, I'm not as stupid as you.\" Touche good sir, touche.\nTL;DR:"}

Senior cat (18+) acting very weird with the arrival of new kitten (7wks).\nPOST: Hey guys. I have a very old tuxedo cat named Furball who has always been a huge grouch. We think that she was adopted as a feral kitten and never really got socially domesticated. She is very antisocial, keeps her distance from any and all other animals, and only cares for me and my boyfriend.\n\nFor an old cat she APPEARS to be doing extremely well. She has no hair loss and only very slight color fading around her white spots. She moves around really easily, she still eats and drinks plenty, has always maintained a healthy weight and still uses the litter box. She even comes around for the occasional scratch behind the ear. I always thought she was in pretty good health.\n\nLast night we brought home a new kitten. They didn't even interact before we put the kitten to bed. But since last night Furball has periodically been going crazy. Yowling super loud, rubbing her face and body on everything, and now she leaves the room and cat-screams and also walks around like she did when she was in heat many many years ago. Right now she's been in her in-heat position (booty in the air) sitting right next to me for like forever. Furball was never fixed but she also hasn't been in heat since me and my boyfriend have had her (11 months).\n\nCould she be in heat? Does the new kitten have anything to do with this? Furball only very occasionally yowled before, and she hasn't at all since we moved to our new location 2 months ago. I have no idea what's going on and I'm just wondering if any of you have a clue.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. Also, I'm taking the both of them to the vet next week, but since Furball won't let me walk away without leaving the room and screaming I'm pretty deperate for advice.

I was probably a little too rough in dragging him away and got a bite for my troubles. He has bitten me in the past but he never did it hard and skin was never broken. Since it never really hurt I was probably too sure of myself in dragging him away.\n\nThe initial bite hurt a lot. It was on my hand inbetween my thumb and forefinger on the fleshy bit. Pretty much sliced me half an inch and it was bleeding for about 3 minutes. It's hard to tell exactly how much I was bleeding since I immediately ran it under a cold tap until it stopped. From there I balled up some toilet paper and held it there.\n\nI woke up with a swollen hand. My palm looked like it had been slapping ass for the duration of my slumber and is still purply pink. The swelling has been going down pretty nicely and I am coming ever-closer to a comfortable clenched fist.\n\nThe Wikipedia article for rabies doesn't confirm or deny much. It seems as though the mental state of my dog should be the biggest clue. If he doesn't have rabies then neither should I.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\nHe's a 4 year-old Rottweiler (omg aggressive breed, destroy it! hurr) and I've had him for 2 and a half years. I don't know much about the previous owner (friend of friend of moms friend). He isn't aggressive towards people and is always chill with strangers coming up to him.

The relationship itself is solid but I've recently started having doubts as to whether she is the right girl for me as well as some other issues. \nThe first issue is that before we started going out she was a very promiscuous woman(when she first got to college she would go out drinking, black out and hook up/have sex with with random guys). Whenever she says hi to her guy friends, it gets to me that she may or may not have slept with them. I don't know if that's a personal issue with me not accepting the new person she has become and getting over her baggage or whether it's something I should address with her. \nSecondly, she's a very happy person and i like that quality of her a lot but I would like it more if she would express her full range of emotions with me. I've brought this up with her and she says that she thinks she is boring and she doesn't know if she can be anything but just content with everything.\nLastly, she isn't really passionate about certain things. Whenever we are deciding what to do it is up to me to pick something. I enjoy that she wants to share what I like but I also wish that I could figure out what she's really into and share that special bond in her life.

I'm really only down about 10 lbs from the \"normal\" weight I've maintained most of my life as an adult, but I'm going to let myself have this one.\n\nThe thing that really excites me, this time, is that - unlike brief and unsustainable periods of loss in my past - I'm actually doing it in a way that will work. Before, I've been spurred on by the loss of an ex and by disliking myself, thinking that I needed to lose this weight to prove this or that. And in the past, it's failed because the motivation wanes, or I got injured and stopped for a while, or my lifestyle changed and reintroduced things like unhealthy food or alcohol.\n\nWell, this time I've been through it all. I've lived relationship woes throughout this, but they're not why I'm doing it and neither ups nor downs have affected what I'm doing. I'm still living in a city where I can eat or drink whatever I want, but I'm *choosing* not to rather than denying myself the availability. I recently suffered a serious knee injury playing sports, but rather than quitting the gym entirely, I've found ways to work out despite it - without worsening it, of course.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I don't know anymore, what this is...\nPOST: I've been in a long distance relationship for 7 months, with this girl from Germany.\n\nRecently we've been arguing, but it's more her arguing and i just keep quiet because 1. I don't want to continue it and 2. because I cannot argue back to be honest, she'll have a go at me if i do. Recently when playing competitive games, shes been having goes at me, because of us losing. 99% of the time it's not only my fault but to her it's all my fault. She will call me names, leave the call, shout at me ( but as soon as i raise my voice, she has a go at me for raising it). She even said this after me raising my voice, \"I raise my voice, I'm allowed to do that! You're not! You can't f__k me up, I can f__k up anyone.\"\n\nShe makes it seem as if I'm always the problem and I'm the one that needs changing. You know, i love her, i really do but it makes me wonder if she really does love me... Some of the things she does and says it makes me think if another couple would do that to each other. \n\nI like being in this relationship most of the time but when this happens, i just feel lost and lonely. I would never leave her, i guess i want to give her the satisfaction of her leaving me, I also don't want to give up on her but with all this i don't know.\n\nIt's funny because when she needs me I'm always there for her, she can call me whenever, but sometimes when i call her she gets all mad at me. \n\nI cannot leave this relationship, mentally I'm already screwed, with depression and stuff and she is the only thing that can make me happy. I'ts just when she gets mad, she takes it out on me verbally and it makes me think. But yh I've become so dependent on her that i don't see the option of leaving... So I'm just so done and lost... Maybe i should just put and end to everything, with this relationship and my life, then i won't have to worry about anything...\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Is it okay for your partner (M18) to not think you're (F19) special if they value you?\nPOST: Bf and I have been dating roughly 10 months now. We jumped into a relationship very shortly after his exgirlfriend broke up with him. Initially I'd have never guessed the current issue would have been a problem, it was so nice to have my emotional enthusiasm about my partner matched (I have a long history of dating emotionally unavailable and mildly abusive people). My only original concern was that I wouldn't live up to the gap his ex had left.\n\nFast forward to today and things have slowed down as things tend to after a little bit. Valentine's Day was rough I have sunk a lot of effort into crafting a handmade gift of a rose made from all his favorite science related things, really tried hard. He didn't really look at it and that hurt and I mentioned it to him, he kinda glanced it over and said it was very nice.\n\nWe went out to dinner and I was mentioning a guy (earlier in life) who had decided that he fell in love with me though we'd never been on a date, kissed etc. I was just kind of speculating because I think someone stating you have that kind of bond with someone else without knowing them is tricky and not always real. So I posed the question why this guy has decided such a thing.\n\nHe responds with \"Well I mean you're only human\" I wasn't certain what that meant so I asked him to elaborate and basically he says that he doesn't think there is any special reason that guy did that because inherently people aren't special.\n\nI have a feeling he may have noticed the shift in my mood at that point because later that night he mentioned that \"I didn't have to be special because he values and cares about me\". I understand the sentiment, but I'm having a hard time reconciling it in my head. I absolutely adore and love this guy and think that he is absolutely special and that's why I dated him and I think it hurts a bit to not have that same enthusiasm. \n\nHearing others perspectives would be very appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

The hair straightener burned two marks into my mom's $700 Persian rug! \n\nI freaked out, and instead of telling my mom, covered a pillow over the marks on the floor, then went to work.

It lasted two years, my depression that I refused to treat ended it.  I'm getting treated now and I'm determined to recover.  I called some help lines, got lined up for an appointment, and got a number to call when I need to talk to someone immediately.  I tried the depression subreddit too, not sure if it's helpful yet.\n\nAnyway, she said we could still be friends I think but I can't tell if we are not, I was too busy crying the first few days to comprehend much.  Sometimes I can't tell if I'm friends with someone unless they sort of announce it to my face because I have no people skills.  I want to ask but I'm not sure if that's appropriate?  \n\nI'm also worried she's going to get into another relationship before I can be with her again because it happened in the past and it sucked for me.  I want to ask her if she would wait for me while I got better but I'm worried the answer would be no or she'd be offended.  On one hand I realize she left me because I needed to be hurt enough to take real action.  On the other hand I'm scared because she left me and only now that she's gone I realized how important she was to me.\n\nThe really messed up part is that now I think I am starting to understand how she felt during our relationship.  Often times she would talk and try to have a conversation and I would shut down and be quiet because of my problems or stubbornness.  Now I keep hoping she'll say anything even if it hurts because she's been so quiet.\nTL;DR:"}

However, I've since become very content with how I look and know that my boyfriend is crazy about me. I was disappointed to find that this newfound confidence did not solve all my problems--especially because I was sure that my low self-esteem was the root of all evil. \n\nMy ex used to take advantage of me very regularly. I was typically never sober/too weak to say no. I adamantly avoided sex with him, but I could never fully escape it--mainly because of guilt. I always felt extremely used and isolated afterwards but because it was my first relationship I had nothing to compare it to. \n\nYears later, I never thought these experiences would still affect me. Though, I guess it's because I mainly just tried to repress what happened (and why I thought the problem lie elsewhere). My boyfriend is aware of what used to go on in my previous relationship and never pressures me. He's so kind and I absolutely trust him, yet there are still sometimes I hesitate to be touched. I hate feeling this way. \n\nHow can I work through these feelings? How can I communicate better with my partner to overcome this?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me, (20M) with my girlfriend (20F) of exactly a year and a half. I can feel she doesn't have the same spark for me, but don't know how to proceed.\nPOST: So let me just go ahead and give some back story here. My girlfriend Jane and I have been together exactly a year and a half. We started dating at the end of our freshman year of college after we had grown very close as friends during our first year. \n\nShe was the first person I had ever slept with, and I was her third. We have had some ups and downs in our relationship, but mostly ups. I love her more than anything, as she is the best friend that I have ever had and is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. The problem is, I'm starting to get pretty confident that my feelings are not mutual.\n\nI sometimes feel as if she wishes, and I can't say I don't sometimes think about this, too, that we would make better friends than significant others. I don't hear the \"I love you\" in the same way anymore, we rarely have sleepovers or have sex anymore (we used to at least sleep in the same bed pretty much every night together). She says it's because we're both so busy and we never get up in the morning on time for work or class when we do have sleepovers. While I can't argue these things, it still hurts my feelings. \n\nThe two of us used to spend every waking moment together. So much so that we started to drive each other crazy. These past six months or so we have really grown in being able to spend time apart and with our other friends and not getting jealous or petty. This has been refreshing, and I think great for our relationship. But now I feel that she may enjoy the independence too much. I fear she is starting to find that she has more fun without me than when we are together. But I don't think she has the balls per say to break up with me, either.\n\nI don't know, I feel as if I'm rambling at this point. I'm not sure anyone is going to be able to make sense of this situation, but I would appreciate any efforts.\nTL;DR:"}

Headlights somewhat dipping into the end of the pool and the bumper stuck itself through one of our windows. My heart started beating and my mind started racing as I see a man, I shit you not run out of the car naked with nothing on but boots. I hauled ass to get my dad because shit was about to get real. He of course didnt believe when I said a man ran away naked with just boots on and he left his DeLorean in cruise in our pool. My dad finally got up out of bed and followed me to the scene of the crime where the man had reappeared trying to rev his car out of the pool.

I am a worry wart, especially about finances, any probably more than I should be. The reason for this post is because recently I had a bedroom \"accident\" (twice within 2 weeks... thanks trojan), and I'm waiting to find out if the seed stuck or not. I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year and had already been thinking of proposing when it gets closer to our second anniversary. I'm in a good full time engineering job, and I know I'm in a better position than many friends who already have kids. But I had plans to replace my car for a more reliable one, stop renting and actually buy a house, etc.\n\nHow many of you all were set up before having a child, and how many readjusted your plans accordingly?\n\nSorry for the long post, and maybe its a bit personal, but honestly I sometimes feel like I'm a little over reactive or critical of things.\nTL;DR:"}

I cheated on him and at first came clean. he forgave me and we started dating again, but I continued to cheat on him, for whatever reason. I'm not sure what my motive was, but it's not really excusable. so yeah, he is not letting go of me though. he essentially tells me that he cut me so much slack because I'm emotionally fucked up from my family life and that he cares about me too much to see me go without some help. he cares too much, so it hurts him and he can't let go. he knows that I am not really the person that did that, that I can be so much better than that and that he wants to be with the \"real [me]\" in the future. it's all kinda overwhelming to me, and it's getting in the way of his life. I don't know, I think things would be better off if we just stopped talking. we've tried to before, but ultimately both of us caved. does anyone have any advice for helping him get over me and for me to have the willpower to go through with my decision to go nc with him?\nTL;DR:"}

I have no problem with it, more power to me, etc, etc. I'm having fun, no one is getting hurt. Except Mark who gets offended and calls me out on it, saying I was easy and my hookups with other guys are \"disgusting.\" I'm normally a calm person but this absolutely infuriated and hurt me, since he was talking (bragging) about his sexual conquests as well, making him seem extremely hypocritical, in my opinion. I've since stopped talking about personal things with him, but I am still pretty angry.\n\nThe problem is that we will be living together next year, and I don't know how to proceed because he said some pretty hurtful things and continuing our friendship would be pretty difficult.\nTL;DR:"}

As an example, disagreements tend to come when we have plans to meet up, and she says she can't because she has to go clean her room. Unfortunately we're both really busy, and probably wouldn't be able to meet up for another week so I suggest (not angrily) that she could clean her room a time other than when we had agreed to meet up. She then gets really mad, saying I'm pressuring her and usually there's nothing I can do/say to change her mind. A couple times I've gotten fed up and very mad, and it's convinced her, but I don't want to make her do things, at the same time, we need to have more seriousness about commitments to plans.\n\nI know there's underlying issues with her family who pressure her a lot, and her mother always wants her to be home when she's not at work. Her family is Indian and in a very tightly knit community and I'm white.

She'll sometimes cry for hours when my girlfriend won't do something she wants her to, telling her she's putting her in so much pain and how could she be so negligent of her own parents and family.

We had been good friends for a long time and that developed into a very intense relationship. We had a bad breakup but about six months ago we made up and became friends again.\n\nI'm not sure we should be friends. The problem is that I love her. At first I thought that I just really cared about her because we had been so close in the past, but I realized that that was just self-denial. I try not to let this show at all so that we can continue to be friends, but its hard. \n\nOur friendship isn't terrible but it's inconsistent. We could text all week, and spend an entire afternoon together, but then she'll more or less ignore me for a week after that. Sometimes I feel like she's my best friend, and sometimes I feel like we're distant acquaintances. I figured out a while ago that I have no control over this so I just let her do what she wants. It's really draining though. I have to constantly adjust my expectations, actions, and emotions to make this work, and its making me miserable.  I don't think I do anything wrong either. I'm nice to her, maybe every once in a while i'll text her too much, but I do my best to respect boundaries, so I'm kind of confused. \n\nMy question for you is how do I make this work?  I'm pretty sure we both like and care about each other. However, this relationship isn't really healthy for me. While it may be unfair of me, I need consistency, and a degree of closeness with her for this friendship to work. We're both people that do what we want so i feel like if thats what she wanted then there wouldn't be a problem.

I'm a junior, but I transferred here so I'm still in my first year on campus. I've fallen in with a group of people who are part of a club on campus, and more specifically with a group of sophomores that is usually me and three girls. I see these people on a very regular basis, we eat dinner as a group basically every day of the week, and lunch together a few days a week, as well as club activities and other things.\n\nLast semester, I realized I had feeling for one of the girls I hang around with. At the time I was still new to the group and wanted to know her better before I asked her out (I'm very shy). As I've gotten to know her more, my feelings for her have strengthened and we've become closer (I would consider us friends), though I've never openly flirted with her because I'm shy. I'm a very sensitive person and feel very strongly towards her. I feel now like I've reached the point where I feel like I should ask her out if I want to have a relationship with her. \n\nBut the problem is that I'm worried about the repercussions if she says no. I'm very sensitive and have basically no experience, no previous relationships, never even held hands with a girl. I don't think that my friends or her friends would all hate me, but it would be very awkward and painful for me to see her if she says no. I'm also somewhat socially insecure. I've worked to combat my insecurities and have come along way simply hanging around with them like I do now, but I'm worried that I'll fall back into the way I used to be if she said no, like I'd start to think I was boring and unattractive. And my friends in this group are literally my only friends at college, so it's not like I could leave the group. \n\nI want to be realistic and realize that she's probably not going to suddenly fall in love with me.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: my (19f) boyfriend (19m) freaks out about my gay friend (23m)\nPOST: Hi all! I'm in a bit of a pickle. My boyfriend and I have a complicated history. We were best friends for about 4 years before we started dating. We dated for 9 months before he felt he needed to break up to become closer to God and I agreed but ended up an atheist. We were in a strange limbo for about 6 months where we thought it wasn't going to work because of this difference but we found we couldn't stand to be apart so we started dating again about 3 months ago. \n\nDuring this limbo stage I met a guy on an app called vine. We became close and we gave each other our numbers so we could talk more frequently. We became super close and he helped me feel less alone during the break up and I helped him find his confidence to admit that he was gay. He's honestly one of the people I'm closest to because he lives in Ohio and I live in Florida and it's so much easier to open up to strangers than to your friends some times. (I have issues with opening up because of a weird history of suppressing my feelings so fave to face emotional talks are weird to me)\n\nThe real trouble starts when I get back together with my boyfriend. He hates my best friend. So much so that even if he sees the name pop up on my phone he gets incredibly upset at me. His biggest wish is probably that I stop talking to my friend completely, which I think is ridiculous. We're just close friends that helped each other through lonely and dark times and I don't want to stop talking to him. My boyfriend won't listen to reason and even if I tell him that he should just get over it, he flat out refuses, as if he wants to stay upset. It's gotten to the point that I have to put my friend on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode when I'm with my boyfriend so that he won't pop up on my screen and \"trigger\" him. \n\nI just want to know if I'm being unreasonable.\nTL;DR:"}

She is attending an arts college for a year before going to university and i'm moving away in a few weeks to my university a two hour drive away. I spent a week at university at the start of summer to meet people on my course and (as i always have) i made friends with some of the girls on my course more than the guys. This really set my girlfriend worrying about my fidelity even though I have never given her a reason to mistrust me before. Except for one time when in a club after jokingly discussing a polygamous relationship I got really drunk and offered her up to a guy who nearly took me up on the offer before realising I was incredibly drunk. After this we took a two day break (a period where we cut all communication and let things cool before discussing issues) in which time she was talking to a guy on her street who wants her pretty bad, they even arranged to meet before we started talking again and she cancelled. I found this out a month ago and it shit me up pretty bad I confronted her about it after he text her while I was using her phone and opened the message as it came in. I really want to just tell her that she has no reason to freak out when she is three doors away from some one she can be with if she so chooses and all the girls I'll be seeing and spending time with are already just friends. It frustrates me and I want tell her how I feel but I know it will end up confrontational. I also really want to ease her trust issues. Any help or advice would be majorly appreciated. thanks guys and dolls :)\nTL;DR:"}

I had only recently gotten over a really bad break up with an ex so it took a while before I noticed her and developed a crush on her. \n\nAbout two weeks ago I introduced myself and made small talk and asked her out. I asked her if she wanted to get lunch or hang out or something the next day. She said she might be busy so she sent me friend request and told me she's message me if she was free. She forgot to message me the next day but Thursday of that week she sent me a message apologizing for forgetting and offered to reschedule to next week or until after her midterms were over. I agreed to that and about 2 weeks have gone by and her last midterm is this Thursday. \n\nI saw her in class today and when we were making small talk I found out she had a boyfriend. She just casually mentioned it. There was pizza in class and she wasn't having any because she's lactose intolerant. She was taking a box of it home and when I asked why that's when she mentioned it was her boyfriend's favorite kind. I just left after that. I did see her on campus a few times with some other guy but I never saw hold hands or anything like that so I just assume they were friends. \n\nWhy would she agree to the date and offer to reschedule when she has a boyfriend? Maybe she didn't realize I was asking her out? Also should I still pursue her if she messages me and actually wants to go on the date? She seems really sweet and id like to get to know her more and  I've been known to be pretty persistent when it comes to girls but it seems like a bit of a moral grey area to date someone who has a boyfriend and \"steal\" her away in a sense.\nTL;DR:"}

Her dream has always been UCSF, literally one of the best med schools in the country. She got invited to interview, and shortly after found out she was on the waitlist. As of 3 weeks ago she had about 6 acceptances (which is ridiculously amazing), and we were planning on going to USC. She found out she got in at UCLA, which would be a much cheaper option and a MUCH more prestigious school. We were super excited and signed a lease for a beautiful apartment on the west side, signed a lease, and bought a new bed. \n\nNow of course, 4 days ago she found out she got into UCSF off the wait list. A huge part of her wants to ditch out on LA and move up to SF, but she doesn't want me to resent giving up all my work and connections and friends down here. She wants to go on an adventure while we still can, before we have kids and stuff. Part of me wants to support her in this endeavor and move up but at this point it would be a huge ordeal. Breaking a lease, finding a new apt in San Fran at the last minute (we are insanely busy through the first week of August and couldn't start looking until then), probably burning through all of my savings doing so.\n\nIs it worth it to pursue this dream? I feel like I would be giving up a lot in LA, but what's wrong with a little adventure? Is moving away from all of our family and friends (support system) during an extremely stressful time stupid? \n\nThere are so many potential regrets either way and we are paralyzed by this decision. I'm afraid of holding her back, and she's afraid of holding me back. The financial difference at the end of school could easily be over $100,000 in loans, about a 40% increase.

No huge disasters so far; good flow of communication; the occasional visit to each other's home states.  And I miss her more than ever these days.

He is a 6-yr old cocker spaniel who hasn't been fixed.  He was able to drag himself around, and he could put some weight on his back legs, but he couldn't control them.  I took him to the animal emergency center in my town and they told me that it's most likely he's had a ruptured disc in his spine.  \n\nThe testing to check exactly what the problem is was estimated around $1,600.  The surgery to fix the problem was estimated at $5,000.  The alternative treatment is medicinal therapy, including anti-inflammatory, steroids, pain meds, and muscle-relaxers.  According to the vets, if 'deep pain' goes away, then there is no hope of reversal without surgery, which is not an option because of money. They also said that if he doesn't heal in the next two weeks, then he's not going to heal. \n\nSo, I want to know what to do in the next 2 weeks to give him the best odds of healing.  So far, all I've been told by the vets is to give him strict \"bed-rest\" in his kennel, only carrying him to the yard a few times a day to potty.  If he doesn't heal, then I may need to put him down depending on his condition - either that, or have him in a wheel chair, \"expend his bladder\" up to 6 times a day, and keep a diaper on him for his BM's.  \n\n[Here's Mikey.](\nTL;DR:"}

She seems to be getting more desperate, and I'm worried she might do something crazy, need help about what to do next.\nPOST: I'm not usually one to ask for advice on forums, but I could really use some advice/perspective. Here is the story:\n\nI dated (aka hooked up with) her for about 2 months at the end of college (I was a senior, she was a junior). I never got the impression that it was any sort of real relationship, though I did like her and thought of her as a good friend. Anyway, after I graduated, I moved across the country, and we have been keeping in touch as casual friends (sharing tales about our lives, keeping each other updated, etc. nothing romantic). Lately she's been sending me messages hinting that she's \"in love with me\" and recently she even sent me a text that said \"I love you.\" She's also been insinuating that she's planning on moving across the country to Chicago (where I live) to be with me. This was an issue in the past, and I've spoken with her about it, about how I didn't reciprocate those feelings, but the talk didn't seem to work. Now I've taken the approach of just cutting off all communication with her. I don't respond to texts, calls, messages on facebook. Anything. Instead of her taking a hint, she seems to think that this is me sending her a message that I hate her, and I'm worried she might hurt herself, though I feel like it would hurt her more to tell her straight up that I'm ignoring her because I don't want her to be a part of my life. I was hoping that she would take the hint and that would make it less painful.\nTL;DR:"}

However there are some things that I am having some trouble with.\n\nThe first thing I should mention is that she has recently (but well before I had met her) begun a fairly successful run at being a camgirl.  This fact does not bother me, in fact I find it quite exciting, but it is related.\n\nShe was quite upfront with the fact that she had been in loving polyamorous relationships in the past but was perfectly happy being monogamous.  The thing is that for the past couple years she has been in contact with a man who she engages in phone sex with.  It is more than just that, he is a good friend to her now and has acted as a confidant and counselor through some rough patches.  He also acts as her advisor and moderator for her cam-girl activities.  She wants to continue having this relationship, and I do not feel that it would be right of me to ask her to stop.  However, I am having trouble accepting this part of her life.\n\nAny advice would be welcome.\nTL;DR:"}

This is the biggest reason I have distanced myself from her. I feel that no combination of words will ever make her realize how much she's hurting us.

Her tantrums used to hurt me but I've basically put a wall up and now they don't, but that wall is what's keeping me and my mother apart.\n\nMe and my siblings cannot stand her. My father cannot stand her. I want her to change but she just won't. I've explained to her countless times what's wrong with her but she just won't listen. I just need her to see herself from a point of view outside of herself, but it doesn't seem like she's capable of that kind of thing.\n\nDo I keep trying?

I go running 4x a week, so he does have basis for asking my advice. A couple of years ago he worked out a lot and got really fit, but that has deteriorated recently due to school pressures, and now he is having trouble fitting into his old jeans. After giving him the standard motivation ideas, including sleeping better, decreasing future medical bills, preserving mental health, etc., he said that those ideas helped him cognitively but didn't motivate him to actually get out and exercise or control his diet. So I explained that I stay motivated to keep fit by reminding myself that I want to look good for him the next time we spend time together. \n\nWhen he said that still doesn't motivate him, I (stupidly) tried to work into the conversation that when he was really fit a couple of years ago, I was extremely physically attracted to him. The goal was to try to use me being attracted to him as motivation. I immediately regretted opening my mouth, since I am still very physically attracted to him and I know how badly remarks like that can damage self-esteem. He was - understandably! - upset and hurt, but had to leave the conversation to start a shift at work before we could work it out. \n\nHow do I make this right? I feel like such an incredible ass and I am completely aware of how badly I screwed up. We won't see each other again in person until August - how do I convince him that I love him and think he's a studly human being without being able to initiate sexy time and prove it?\n\nOther details: We've been in a committed relationship for 4 years and have normally had very good communication.

I need some help concerning an issue that has recently come up in my life. My father is a Southern Baptist preacher, and I am a agnostic with neo-pagan tendencies. I decided to be what I am instead of pretending to be a Christian when I was 16. Because I was still in high school, my father and I had some rows, but we got through them together and now he fully accepts me for who I am. As you can see, this is not the issue I have difficulties with.\n\nWhen I was 17, my father's church started struggling, specifically in it's youth (7th to 12th grade) department. The youth \"minister\" was a dick to all the kids, and some of the elders of the church blamed it on the kids, saying that they weren't responding well to the \"minister's\" \"selfless\" services. Being the Good Guy Greg I am, I thought that if he saw that someone in the youth trusted him, he might stop being such an asshole. So, in confidence, I told him about my religious preferences. Nothing changed, and he resigned as the youth minister a few weeks later. However, as soon as he was out of the youth ministry, he began petitions against my father saying that he was unfit for the position of pastor. His reasoning being that if my father could not \"raise his kids right, then he will not be able to lead others.\"\n\nSeveral months have passed since then, but his petition has grown in strength and my dad is at serious risk of losing his job.

I try my best to remain partial, and only act on serious tip offs, but I still think about female friends, even from college, that I never asked out. Are there any tips or ideas you guys could give someone to change their view so that not every new female friend is someone I eventually consider asking out?\nTL;DR:"}

Me and this guy have a horrible history of verbal confrontations during freshman and sophomore year, junior year we made up but it was obviously tense. He hooked up with my now girlfriend before we started dating, and then I started having a thing with her and he brought back emotions from freshman year and ruined a party for me claiming it was cause of our past rather than the girl.\n\n2.5 months later I've told my girlfriend he bugs me , he does kickboxing  with my girlfriend and they talk quite a lot sometimes up till late nights. He recently told my best girl friend that he's gonna try non-stop on new years to hook up with her. I'm currently not in the same country as her (though I will be for New Years) and I'm really nervous something might go down, cause she goes a little crazy when shes drunk.\nTL;DR:"}

But that's pedantic anyway. I'm 21, and I have never had a relationship or sex, any woman I have ever fancied has not liked me back, and vice versa for the one (maybe 2) women who've fancied me. This tells me that I am unattractive, or at least bad with women. I cannot imagine myself ever being in the throes of passion, I went on rateme and the general consensus was that I am a 5. Who has a honeymoon period with a 5? Who can't keep their hands off a 5? I can only imagine what if must be like to desire someone, and be desired in equal measure. I have a pretty solid idea how my love life will go. Somewhere between now and 30 I'll meet my first girlfriend, I won't be particularly attracted to her, and I won't plan for it to be long term, but complacency, free sex, and societal pressure will lead to me marrying her and living out my days as one of those married couples who pretty much tolerate each other for the tax breaks and seriously screw up their kids. I'm also worried about being someone's backup plan, like some woman might just settle for me. I'm not good looking or charismatic, I'm funny, clever, nice and stable. I'm boring old Mr Reliable. Basically saying, im the guy the girl marries but doesn't fantasise about and will possibly cheat on. I pay the bills but I don't get her hot and bothered. Is there hope? Are any of you less than attractive guys who have also found happiness with another?\nTL;DR:"}

We have both been seeing other people for the last year and a half, but we kept seeing each other and basically living together. Back in January of this year while I was at a wedding, I hooked up with a friend of a friend [36M] who lives in a different city. We started talking and texting long-distance, and I went to visit him again a few weeks ago. He does not know about my non-monogamous relationship but he does know that I see other people. Now I think I fell in love with this guy, and am definitely done with the other one because things have gotten progressively terrible. I'm ready to change and get away from the old dude, but I don't think I'm ready for a relationship yet. The new guy is amazing but I was blindsided, I wasn't ready for someone so incredible to step into my life, haven't even started processing this terrible relationship that is just now ending. I think about new guy all the time, and really think I could be totally happy and in love with him and be an amazing girlfriend, but I have this bitterness to get through first. I know I need to sort my head out but I don't want to lie to this guy, hurt him, or make him think he's not special. I think we were both not expecting to have feelings for each other. He also has tried to distance himself from me a little bit lately, I think because he has noticed me being weird about certain things (being really vague about what my life is like and who I hang out with). He was coming from a dry spell/being single, but I'm not. I want to be on the same page and I'm willing to change. I'm seeing him again soon, I could have a talk with him... or not?\n\nOh also, I am moving to his general neck of the woods (about 3 hours away) for work later this summer, so it's LDR now but not totally crazy to think about future possibilities - or is it?\nTL;DR:"}

Immediately after that last long run, I iced as usual - except I couldn't find the usual cloths I use to wrap my ice-packs in, and successfully gave myself a cold burn on the back of my heel. Yes. I'm an idiot.\n\nFour days after this, having already missed my first taper run, I bandaged up and went out for 5 miles. It was painful, but I ran through it. The result was a nasty blister right on the back of the burned heel. Did I mention I'm an idiot?\n\nSo, here we are, two weeks out, and I've learned my lesson not to try and put my trainers back on until this thing heals. I'm not worried about the injury itself for race day, as it's healing well and there's still time. What I *am* concerned about is missing more taper runs, and I wanted to poll the sub to see if there were recommendations for exercises / routines that could be done at home that might in some way keep me in fighting form.\nTL;DR:"}

It's easy to look like a slob when you're chasing deadlines. House in shambles, sweatshirts every single day, takeouts for lunch (or none at all) and one a week house-cleaning session (if you're lucky to get the time). It's even worse when kids entered the picture - less sleep, more missing deadlines and much, much messier house. \n\nMy spouse flipped his shit last night, when he saw I hadn't mopped the kitchen floor.

Long story short, he treated me like crap 3 years ago when he dumped me twice because he wanted to get back together with his ex-girlfriend. Granted, we were never dating seriously; only went out on 4 dates in restaurants each time and had just makeout sessions before he disappeared each time, I feel hurt. I was so young and stupid and took him back every time he came back. He did not even have to work that hard. I was openly waiting for him arms open, ready to forgive. I guess, I was just desperate for male attention and just wanted to prove to myself that a guy would come back for me.\n\n3 years later now, however, I find myself deeply embarrassed. I cannot believe he I put myself through that! He was so rude and disrespectful and so careless. Even though, now, after 2 years of dating, I find him to be sweet and caring and kind and very in love with me. He says he wants to marry me and I want to marry him too.

We went to pick her up but she was still getting ready and so I met her mother and the first thing she told me was 'Oh John I've heard so many wonderful things about you. Mary is always talking about you!' \n\nMary was clearly a bit embarrassed though not sure if she just didn't want me to get the wrong idea. There's this guy she's kinda seeing??? They're not boyfriend and girlfriend but they're pretty close, so I didn't think too much of it in the moment. She dismissed it as that it was just for helping change the headlights on her car one time. \n\nAnyway Mary went upstairs to grab her purse and while the mother and I were alone she began asking me questions about if I went to church, how often I went to church, which church I went to, my job, what my job entailed, if I was happy there etc. Which I just brushed off as typical parent wanting to know more about a friend of her kid. \n\nWe went out, had a good time. 2 of my friends needed to use the bathroom by the time we dropped her off and apparently couldn't hold it so they went back into Mary's house and while they were all preoccupied with the family dog the mother came up to me and tried to clarify that what she had told me earlier about Mary always talking about me was simply an overstatement 'she talks about a lot of people.' That's when I first became a tad suspicious but I decided to help her out and replied 'Yeah, well she's just a good person, she's got a great heart.' Her mom then put her hand on my arm and whispered to me 'I'm so glad you said that.'\n\nSo am I reading into this too much or is there something going on here and she's been talking about me in a 'I have a crush on this guy' kind of way to her mom?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Which banks will refinance a 30-year private student loan?\nPOST: I have a private student loan that was originated through Citibank years ago. It recently got sold to Discover. It was a 30-year $40,000 loan. The monthly payment is $325. So far it's been churning for years and the total balance is still above $40,000.\n\nI called Discover to ask about refinancing the loan or getting a new (shorter) loan term. They said they bought a bunch of loans from Citi and frankly didn't have anything to offer. They even suggested finding another bank who could offer a better value and taking the loan over to someone else. \n\nI feel like at this point the best option would be to make a lump-sum payment (probably $10,000) and then refinance the balance into a 15-year loan with roughly the same $300ish monthly payment. I have enough in savings to make the lump sum payment and over the length of the loan this will save tens of thousands of dollars. \n\nTwo questions: 1) does this seem like the best course of action? 2) which banks even offer something like this? My preliminary research and phone calls have turned up bupkis. Most banks don't seem to want to deal with private student loans.\nTL;DR:"}

I had this girl in quite a few of my classes sophomore year of high school (I am a junior now) and had developed quite the crush on her. Me, being the little shy kid with bad hair, would not ask her out because I figured I would get rejected and it would be award around her for the rest of the year. So the year wraps up and I hate myself for not asking her out, but the show must go on so I distract myself from my thoughts of her however I can. Come July I still can't get her out of my head, the World Cup (was with Netherlands) was a pleasant distraction but overall I was still pretty sad.

Lo and behold, we end up talking 6 hours through the night! We keep up talking for hours daily for two weeks, and even managed to get together one time with a few other people, but with other people so it wasn't a date. After two weeks she travels, and every time I try to talk to her I get one word responses. I figure it was just that she was traveling sand didn't have time but even after she came back she wouldn't talk to me. The new school year starts and we don't have any classes together :( so I cant really talk to her much in person, and sometimes she would avoid any room I was in, poking her head in then leaving. Now I was very confused. So I keep up talking to her hoping she would eventually warm up to me again, and eventually she sends me a message saying why she was ignoring me and that she felt immature. What's funny is that as I replied to that message, she was online, but never sent anything else. I tell myself everything will be ok, but yesterday my friend saw her flirting with this guy that has seemed to have been getting close to her, so I'm not so sure.\nTL;DR:"}

His Dad.....not so much.\n\nWhile his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad's side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom's house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom's that night. \n\nAnd ever since then, they've still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to \"take him away\" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.\n\nI just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.\n\nI just don't know how to proceed; how do I win them over? How do I handle feeling like the black sheep when I want to spend the rest of my life with this man, despite how his Dad and his stepmom are acting?\nTL;DR:"}

When I ask her out she doesn't give me a no, and her reason for not saying yes is that she's afraid to the eventual breakup. \n\nI asked her what her feeling were towards me and she told me that she saw me as a best friend until things got \"different\", she wouldn't elaborate on what that I meant. She says that when I ask her if we're in relationship or not that it bothers her because she doesn't get that very often so she'll just run away from the discussion or try to avoid it.\n\nI cant figure her out.

It's a long story, but I found out after the fact that Mary and Kay hate each other and can't be in the same room together. I was super stressed about it, but then I ended my engagement I hadn't thought it since.\n\nNow I'm engaged again, and I'm ready to put together my bridal party!!! Although my FH has changed, the ladies I want to stand up with me have not... but I have no idea what to do about Mary. I don't really want to ask her to be a bridesmaid, because Kay has been like a sister to me for 20 years, and I do NOT want drama or tension when the bridal party gets together. I'm worried that Mary will assume that she'll be asked and get really offended when she's not. What's the etiquette here? Is there one?\nTL;DR:"}

He likes knowing that a particular story has been vetted by the upvote/downvote system, and since a lot of reddit posts are rather geeky, then it matches his interests well.\n\nNow do not get me wrong, I love the geeky posts, as I am the supergeek in the house, but if I wanted new stories to read, I just go to google reader and go through my 70+ tech, videogame, sci-fi, psych, and everything else RSS feeds.\n\nSo, what say you?\nTL;DR:"}

I've always wanted to live out a S&M fantasy as the dom and the co-worker is very handsome as well.

She gets annoyed easily, has said she's tired of being in a relationship. Physical intimacy is all but gone. I work from home, she doesn't -- we only see each other a bit each day, but she still gets easily annoyed. Some days will be awesome, others horrible. It's like we go from having fun to her being aggravated the next.\n\nThe thing is, there's no way out. We're under a contract to be here for another year. So if we do break up, what then? How do I handle that? I have an office with a couch in it that I'm more than happy to use if I have to -- my office is pretty badass, actually. I'm just not sure how to handle the emotional aspect of it, other than getting really, really drunk.\nTL;DR:"}

I need a girl's advice!\nPOST: I was at a very intimate and psychedelic concert Saturday night. I had glimpsed this very attractive girl and soon near the end of the concert she made her way over to me. I was asking myself if I should make a move seeing that she had positioned herself in front of me in a very tight environment. I never really understood how these kinds of situations work. I'd always see this kind of thing happen with friends of mine but I never really had it happen to me. I didnt want to be that creepy guy that just grabs a random girl.\nAnyway! We ended up getting closer and I began to hold her hand from behind and we became very physical. Not sexually. There was no limit to how close our bodies were too each other, becauae of this the live experience of the music was enhanced, and she seemed very into it. It felt so intimate and appropriate. Like the feeling you get when you give somebody a very passionate hug. After the concert she told me \"thanks, I needed that\"\nShe took off and I figured maybe she's going through some spit. So I followed her to tell her goodnight and we exchanged names. As I left I gave her a kiss on the forehead.\nTL;DR:"}

There's a coffee shop that I kept going to for about a month or two and there was a cute girl that always kept a conversation going with me. She had a bunch of aspect about her I liked and she even somehow seemed nervous around me! But anyways the last time I saw her I was in a hurry and as she was putting the cash in the register I just walked away and said \"Thank you, keep the change!\" She looked a liittle disappointed. But anyways ever since then I haven't seen her there. I never asked her out because I was waiting to start my new job first. Maybe I'm just incredibly unlucky and she changed her work schedule and I happen to not go every day she works.\n\nSo what I'm wondering is if I should ask the other baristas about her? Maybe see if she just started working at another coffee shop? I'm really bummed out that I missed my chance to ask her out. I should have done it sooner. And I'm not sure if asking about her is kind of weird... For some reason we never exchanged names completely. So I'd probably just be asking about \"the redhead that used to work here\". Is that weird?\nTL;DR:"}

No I don't believe AA works, been there, done that. I prefer coming home from a tough day at work and enjoying a couple decent beers. That being said I can see what drinking every night is costing me, financially and spiritually.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [23F] with my bf [24M] of 2 months, am I selfish in wanting more affection?\nPOST: A little background at first. We've been officially together since April this year but have been hooking up since October last year regulary. We had a deal that we can also see other people but tell each other, so basically something like an open relationship. I've had a rough breakup in September 2013 so at first we didn't want a serious relationship, just wanted to have some fun together. But after a while we started to develop feelings for each other. He had more feelings in the beginning and in April he said he wanted to be with be. After about 2 weeks I agreed. \n\nThings went downhill from that point. Before we were together he was really nice and caring and was always there for me and wanted to spend as much time with me as possible. After starting a real relationship he became more distant. We still saw each other almost every day but only when we hung out with his friends (which became my friends too over the last months). He'd sleep at my place too but there was so noticable less affection from his side. Last week I talked with him about it and he said he needs more time for himself. But we barely see each other during daytime and when we see each other in the evening with his friends I'm trying to avoid him, since he wouldn't really talk with me anyways.. let alone any sign of affection. So what he wants are some days in the week when we don't see each other at all.. not even when hanging out with our friends. He said I should try to find friends of my own. I asked him if he still wants to be with me and he said yes he wants that and he doesn't want to break up, just needs some time to miss me again.\n\nOn friday I left town for 10 days just to give him some time alone but I'm really stressed because he doesn't even communicate via text with me. I know he said he wants to be with me but on the other hand he doesn't show me that at all and is just distant as if he doesn't care what I'm up to.\n\nAm I too clingy in wanting to recieve more affection from him?

It was quite big so I fit a small bed in there. This was during the summer where I'd wake up at 2pm and go to sleep at 5am playing video games and doing what every on teenage boy does...\n\nHowever, I got curious one night and decided to make a homemade fleshlight. I google \"homemade fleshlight\" and after looking through carved watermelons, to warm banana peels, I saw a DIY sock and condom fleshlight. I made this lil sucker and it was quite awesome. Now for the fuck up. I used this heavenly contraption and when I was done, I threw it in a random drawer, deep down where no one could find it.\n\nOnly a few days after, I had a flight to Colombia to see my family. I was gone for maybe a week.\n\nI got home & everything was perfectly ok, until my grandma seemed like she wanted to talk to me about something. In my head I was like \"Sure grandma, what's up?\" She proceeded on to say that she was cleaning her room when she came upon some funky smell. At this point I was dying inside. \"One of the drawers had a foul smell and I looked inside to see what was in it\". I was dying of embarrassment. She then went on and said \"Look it's okay.\" Then I was like, phew! Homemade fleshlights aren't so bad! \n\n\"Listen, I know you're at that age to have sex..\" \"When did you bring a girl over?\" \"Was it here or in Colombia?\" \"I won't tell your parents\" And she kept going on how I'm not suppose to keep a used condom after I have sex.. \n\nThere was no way for me to tell my grandma I had made a fleshlight and that I actually didn't smash a girl in her closet.\nIt was quite embarrassing if you ask em.\nTL;DR:"}

Recently I dated a middle eastern man, I was really into him. When we first met I was a little worried that he was Muslim and thought that would be our biggest hurdle (although I don't know much about Muslims I wouldn't be completely opposed to it, like I said I am open minded), but found out he was Catholic and I am Christian so I thought it could really work between us. Then, I found out after a few dates that he was not allowed to date me because I am not of the same ethnic background. He wouldn't introduce me to his friends or family because I am Caucasian and this is not allowed for him. I guess this is common so in one aspect, I understand. But in another I'm a little angry and feel like it's a little racist (maybe that word is a little harsh). I just can't imagine moving to another country and then only being able to date someone from America (although I've never had to go through that so maybe I'm being insensitive) Anyway, have any of you been through this?

It'll help you understand why I think what I think.  We met at work the summer before we were married.  At the time we met, we were both in shaky relationships. We started taking breaks together, then lunches, then going out for lunch together, and you get the idea. We made the decision to leave the bad relationships we were in.  He moved in with me, and we got married that October. \n\nSo here's what has my feathers ruffled. This morning, I logged into his tablet to print a note for UPS. He has a generic delivery note saved on his tablet so its a quicker process to use his.  While scrolling to the right file, I came across a note. \n\nIn the note, he addressed it to 337, a number we have no real association with.  He mentions helping them with a desk, I'm assuming carrying it into their apartment. He then goes on to give them his number, saying that he has trouble making friends and to text him if they want to. \n\nI don't know if this was ever delivered to anyone, the gender of the intended person, or if he ever talked to anyone.  I did not purposely seek out this note, as I (until this morning that is) fully trust my husband and there has never been any kind of trust issue between us. What should I make of this note? How, if at all, should I bring it up to him? The date on it was in June. It's been a full month since he wrote it, so I don't know what to think. \n\nPlease don't be cruel in your replies, Blunt is fine but not cruel please.\nTL;DR:"}

Her aggression towards other dogs has really come out only in the last year (she's about 3), and before that we used to be able to take her around other animals without any problems.  Some switch in her brain just flipped one day at the dog park when she got into a fight, and she hasn't been able to socialize with other dogs except our lab since.\n\nWe've tried all we can to contain her, including building a giant play area behind the house surrounded by an eight-foot fence topped with electric wire, which she has **no fear** of climbing.  We've tried every kind of lead imaginable (she has wriggled out of or destroyed every one), and my dad even once tied a small medicine ball to her harness to deter her from jumping only to have her drag it behind her when she escaped.  She runs like hell when you chase after her and ignores all attempts to call her, but she usually comes back after a few hours (after she's had time to piss off the neighbors, chase cars, etc).\n\nOther than our own sadness, we can't get rid of her because it would devastate my brother and our roly-poly black lab, both whom whine constantly when she's not around.  Extra exercise and playtime hasn't really helped alleviate her \"boredom,\" if that's what you could call it.  She's obedient when she's contained and we try to be affectionate when she returns from running off, but once she's off on her own it's like \"fuck you, people who feed and love me, it's my show now!\"  She's really a sweet dog to have around people and is very playful and affectionate, but she's so unstable when she's loose and so difficult to contain that we don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

He's a larger dude, about 6'5\", and in pretty good shape- he runs daily but also drinks/smokes quite a bit. My issue is, whenever we have sex, he gets SO SWEATY. Like, looks like he jumped in the pool kind of sweaty. It kind of kills the mood for me, because he sometimes drips on me (which grosses me out) and he gets so slippery that it's distracting!!! It's also making my acne break out, and I am 24 and don't want to be dealing with that shit so far out of my teenage years. Plus, I have to wash my sheets constantly because they get all damp and smelly. Our solutions thus far have been to keep a sweat towel close by or to hook up in the shower. Just wondering if there are other Redditors who share my troubles. Obviously excessive sweat is not a deal breaker for me, but if anyone has helpful tips or advice I would absolutely appreciate it!\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/running\nTITLE: Aerobic Capacity Vs Physical Fitness. Am I normal?\nPOST: Hi Reddit! (First post so please tell me if i do anything horribly wrong.) I noticed a phenomena that I presumed is relevant only to new runners. This might be a completely usual thing and, if so, I apologize for taking up your time! I'd be interested to hear your opinion.\n\nI'm a new runner; I'd say I've been properly interested for about 3 months. I find that on my runs I'm gasping for air within the first couple of kilometers. However as I struggle on, maintaining my pace, I seem to need to breath less and less. Eventually by the 12km mark I'm breathing intermittently with my mouth shut.  Around the 15km mark I seem to hit a wall energy wise and start failing to maintain a pace as everything gets 'clunky' and forced. However even then my breathing is very easy.\n\nI'm asking you guys if this is a normal phenomena for new runners? Most reports I've come across suggest that most new runners are limited by their muscle soreness much more than a shortness of breath? If it is interesting why do think its occurring?\n\nAnyways some relevant facts that might help your ponderings: \n1) I'm a mid-20s male ~90kgs\n2) I'm NOT asthmatic \n2) Over 5km I'd struggle to maintain a 4:30/km pace\n3) For the 15ish km runs I run about 6:00/km pace\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I'm in no way concerned about this. I'm sure as my body adapts to my activity everything will normalize. Just thought it could be interesting to ponder about. :)\nTL;DR:"}

Does anybody else have stories like this?\nPOST: I'll go first. I was in the 5th grade, and a girl asked me out over Yahoo! Messanger. She said that lots of guys were after her and that I have to hurry with my decision; I said yes. The relationship went well for the first few days until she got a little too comfortable. \n\n     She kept slapping  me in the face because that was her idea of playing/flirting. I told her to stop but as a kid, she didn't. I got tired of it and broke up with her. Ironically, she slapped me and stormed away. She started telling everyone that she broke up with me because I was ugly and kept slapping her...wow. All the girls at recess kept chasing me everyday and beating the living fuck out of me.\n\nLater on, she tried to make me jealous by going out with my best friend and hugging him when I came around. She even wrote poems about me and read them to the class; \"AculticFly is so ugly, he looks like the grinch. Blah, blah, blah.\" I didn't show any interest, so she stabbed and cut my with a rusty bobby-pin on the last day of school. Your turn.\nTL;DR:"}

While we were talking the other day though we got to talking about sex; I brought up our kiss at the end of one of our dates and how she seemed very shy and nervous during the whole thing. She then told me that she's never even held hands with a guy until me so it's all pretty new to her and she's embarrassed about it.\n\nShe isn't waiting until marriage or anything along those lines, she has just never been in a relationship before. She told me she doesn't like the idea of being a prude and that she does want to try having sex eventually but she is nervous about doing it. \nI told her that I'd like her to be comfortable and I wouldn't pressure her into anything she wasn't ready for.

I have explained that I don't need to attend the class to her, but it seems she is having the same response as this thread, so I need to make it more clear to her.\n\nThe masters is by coursework, not research. I do not intend to do a PhD. I intend to become a practicing clinician.\n\nI fucked up at the start by missing 3 one hour classes in an introductory subject on a topic I am not familiar with. This is because the class is at 8am and I slept in. There is no excuse for this.

I did not make it clear enough that missing the other two subjects is actually the default position, and by going to class at all I am doing more than is necessary of me.\n\nMy problem is with M noticing that I am often not in class and mentioning this to me and others.

She just laughed it off at first, then told me she didn't want our friendship to end (we go along very well, making the other laugh on a daily basis on our 60k+ messages long FB conversation). She didn't want to say that we'd be just friends forever either.\n\nI was kind of confused by the situation I put myself in. After that one party where I saw them together again, I completely broke down and ran back home in tears, kicking & punching the walls. Stopped all conversations with her for about a week. Then got into the friendship again, like before. \n\nI don't want her to be just my friend, neither do I want to jeopardize our friendship because of some drama I built up on my own because of overthinking stuff. I can't help to imagine possible scenarii when she complains to me about her boyfriend, about stuff he's not doing right etc.. Then I proceed to feel guilty.\n\nAt times I think she's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and at other times I just can't even stand her presence and become angry. Should I do something ? If, yes, what would that be ? I really feel I can't move on in my life if I don't get a definitive answer from her, and that sucks.\nTL;DR:"}

I hate being called pet names unless it's by my boyfriend. Usually I try to ignore it. If someone says \"How's it going babe?\" I just act like they asked without calling me babe. But if someone starts trying to hit on me I generally don't respond or I respond coldly (depending on what it was. One guy kept asking me if I thought he was special over and over again and I made no effort to sugarcoat my answer). I don't see it as appropriate because I'm at work and I'm just trying to do my job. I'm also at a loss on how to respond tactifully when someone says \"You so cute!\" in baby voice like I'm a puppy, when said puppy talker gets angry that I didn't thank him for his puppy talk, or when someone says he's disappointed that I won't tackle him on the way out of the door if he leaves without a receipt.\n\nThe biggest issue I have is getting pissed off about it. I would like to just ignore these people and forget about it, but instead I'm incredibly annoyed. I know there are groups of people who would say I should be angry but at this point I just want to get on with my day. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

(:\n\nAnyways I'm 21 years old and I've never been in a serious relationship. Now I have had flings here and there but nothing serious because as soon as I feel it getting serious I start to panic and feel smothered and end up breaking up with them and mostly I'm already having my eye on someone else. I remember a couple years ago I heard somewhere that cheating was genetic and I don't know if it's true but I seriously think it is. My father cheated on my mother multiple times and even though I say it didn't affect me because I was too young to understand I am starting to think it did. I can't do relationships because as soon as we put a label on our thing I start to flirt with other guys and basically I act more single than when I am single. I would much rather be by myself and I hate having to answer to someone. I couldn't care less about what my partner does.\nAnd another thing, I can't do PDA. When I see other couples doing it I just think how fake it is. I know they aren't going to be like that forever. I know that while the girl was hugging him he was checking out the chick that passed by.\nAnd like I said I've had flings here and there but I've mostly been the other woman. When I see a guy that's in a relationship it's like I'm suddenly attracted to them and I won't stop till I make them stray. It's never gotten serious like leaving the wife for me but it's just mostly flirting and making sure they go home thinking about me. \n\nI can honestly say I don't want to be in a relationship anytime soon and everyone tells me 'when you meet the right guy' but I'm starting to think that I'll just end up fucking it up with every guy. I'm not sure if I have 'daddy issues' but I do want to know how to overcome my fear of commitment.\nTL;DR:"}

I messaged her and asked her what's up and she said she wasn't too sure about our situation and I was like what do you mean. Apparently she started to become afraid and not sure about our relationship because we never established that we were bf/gf even though she would text me in the morning and say she misses me, hell I even have booked Annual Leave to go on holidays with her. Now she says she's so sorry that she didn't know we were exclusive and she assumed we were in an open relationship (she is very selective with relationships and hadn't had sex for over 2 years before seeing me) I said I assumed we were in a relationship because of the way she and I were acting. I was going to ask her what we were but I became shy and thought the way we were going was awesome. Turns out because she was afraid and didn't want to get hurt she also started seeing another guy while also seeing me. Also not sure if the other guy knows about the situation, but I've talked to her and I just asked her where do I stand as I will not be option 2. So now I'm waiting for her reply, if she says she doesn't know and wants to continue hanging out well I guess it's over for us as I don't think I should be option 2 to someone she's known for a week. \n\nSo yea it's a pretty big fuck up, she is such an awesome chick and I fucked up. My last relationship started the same way as well, ex that I was seeing didn't know we were in a relationship so hooked up with a few guys and then I hooked up with her friend when I found out... and that was the kickstarter for us to be in a healthy relationship for 5+ years.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm just not sure who else to ask, and I figured there might be a few people on here who can relate.\n\nI initially started to gain weight due to several medical reasons (hypothyroid and PCOS added weight, chronic pain prevented activity.) Then I struggled with bulimia and binge eating, which was a major contributor to my weight gain. Over the past year, I have worked hard to build up my self-confidence and to put my self-worth in things other than my weight and my appearance. I have been learning to love myself, flaws and all. All this was before I could even consider losing weight, because I knew I had to get in a healthy mindset before I could truly succeed at getting a healthier body.\n\nAs I lose weight, I find myself becoming more and more confident in my body. I'm excited to feel as great about the outside as I do about the inside! It's a great motivator to keep working towards my goal. \n\nBUT - I'm worried that I'm starting to put more and more self-worth into my body again. Regardless of whether I maintain a goal weight or gain it all back, I'm scared.

She usually ignores me except to talk about going out with other men in the evenings. If I ask about spending time with her in her free time she says she's not sure she can, then immediately and pointedly makes plans with anyone else she knows, and leaves.\n\nShe was my best friend for five years. She was so excited for me to finally be here with her, all the way up until I actually was. Now she's giving me every indication I need to leave her life as soon as possible, while never saying it outright.\n\nI've been very patient through all this, trying to give her the space she needs. She says I'm not doing anything wrong, but she just can't stand me any more. Only a month ago she was very excited to live with me.\n\nI feel so awful right now... I've looked forward to living with her for years, only to see endless proof that my best friend now hates my existence in her life. I spent thousands of dollars to move here, and found some great job opportunities, but now I'll be moving again a month later.\n\nI don't even know where I'm moving from here - I have no job and no real direction.

It's rough, but there are breaks when the good times are just so good. \n\nShe can't find employment in her field and I'm sympathetic to that.

Long story short, I feel like I do everything for both of us. \n\nI don't really want to break up with her, as we share a large social circle and I love her, but I feel that she treated our roommates better (when we had them) than she treats me alone.

For majority of our relationship, he was a rather careless boyfriend that had a lot of growing up to do, and didn't realize what I meant to him until it was too late. (when I moved away to another state) He wasn't a bad guy though and we stayed friends because we get along well and our final breakup was amicable. \n\nHe got a new girlfriend the beginning of this year, and while it did sting at first, I eventually got over it and I was happy for him. But as their relationship seems to get more serious, I'm starting to feel somewhat bitter and comparing our old relationship to his new one. When we were together, he barely took me out anywhere or spent quality alone time with me. Most of our time spent together was with our group of mutual friends. With his new girlfriend, they seem to always be going out to various places and just spending a lot of alone time together. I also put in a lot of effort when we were together while he mainly just coasted, but now he seems to be the opposite. I know it's very petty of me, but basically I feel like I was \"cheated\" by being a dummy girlfriend for him all those years; someone that had to go through all those shitty experiences for him to learn how to be a better boyfriend and now his new girlfriend reaps all the benefits.\n\nI've come to terms with the breakup and don't wish to get back together, but I still can't help feeling this way. Has anyone ever gone through this? How do I get past this? I know people might suggest to cut off all contact/unfollow on social media but I would prefer not to do that since we're still good friends and that would make it awkward...\nTL;DR:"}

I brought it up one time and he was really hurt, so I haven't brought it up again.\n\nI just wish he wanted to spend money on me sometimes. It kind of hurts. I'm not asking for him to pay for everything, I would not want to see him spending all his money, it would just be nice to feel like he loves me enough to *want* to pay for things, especially when he knows I'm struggling. Even when he asks me out to a restaurant he doesn't pay for my meal, we always split the bill, and sometimes I end up paying the tip for both of us. I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable or if my worries are valid. Please let me know. I find myself angry with him because of it. In the beginning of the relationship I used to surprise him with food and then stopped when I realized it wasn't being reciprocated. He is very smart with money and doesn't like to waste it so maybe that's why. \n\nMaybe I'm being a bitch, but I don't think things should always be completely equal all the time, there are exceptions. I'd like it more if he paid for dinner one time, and then I did, etc. It just kind of hurts that after 2 years I can count on my one hand the number of times he's paid for a meal for me.

I admit the reason behind my not liking him is irrational, but whatever, the guy is an idiot. He lives about an hour away. Last time I went to a party of his, it was completely cliquey and very hard to get in on the private, jokie-joke conversations the guests had with each other, because they all work in the same industry. I tried telling my fiancee this, and she doesn't understand why I feel the way I do about it. I can't booze it up and pass the time in a stupor because I have to drive. Got any ideas for entertaining myself?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: What do I(26M) do for Valentines Day during 'rocky times' with my wife(24F)?\nPOST: Okay, so this is my first time doing something like this so any responses are greatly appreciated. My wife and I have been married for just over a year and a half. Since the beginning of December she has told me that she doesn't love me. We have been working through it as we have been together for 8 years and she feels like she owes it to me to at least try. We are currently in couples counseling and recently she admitted how much she loves me and she has been confused and she will do anything to make it work. \n\nI have wronged her by not celebrating holidays and making them special for her. Almost losing my best friend has made me realize she isn't the only one who needs to change or work harder in the relationship. I have never been a fan of Valentines day due to it being a corporate holiday encouraging you to go out and spend money--something I haven't had until recently. I pay all the bills while my wife pursues her dream of being an actress in LA.\n\nSooo I am wanting to make this coming Valentines day special for her. We live just North of Los Angeles and I am having trouble brain storming some ideas. I want to make this extremely heartfelt and special for her, but still we are dealing with a rocky relationship. I am not sure if going all out will be 'too much' e.g planning an outdoorsy day spending the day together and ultimately having a picnic and going out for dinner later. It's only been a week since she started showing my affection again, kissing, but nothing more. I feel confused because I don't know what the boundaries are, but she tells me to \"act normal\". I cant act normal knowing she was on the verge of leaving and nothing has really been the same since. Knowing a little about my situation what advice do you suggest? Do you need more information? Thanks guys!!\nTL;DR:"}

At my school, this teacher for AP World History used to let us grade our own test (Yes....he did) and whoop-dee-doo, kids started to cheat by changing the answers when we went over them. One day, he told everybody in our class that he took pictures of the test before we went over them and anybody that changed it, he would know. So he gave us an ultimatum, turn ourselves in and not get kicked out or he'll submit all of the tests to the principals. The class freaked and about 15 of the kids turn themselves in. At the end of the school year, the day after our AP Exam, he told us that he lied and trolled us all.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm currently 17, a riser senior in high school. He got me a job *essentially* working for someone in his lab.\n\nWith my my dad and his boss' help, I was able to get a grant for $2500 for doing work for 10 weeks from a big medical association. 9-5 M-F for 10 weeks. around 400 hours. \n\nApparently it's the university's policy to not have volunteers, so because I got the grant I'm now on payroll for $10/h. SO between hourly pay and the grant, pay total for the entire summer is around 6500. after federal/state/city taxes closer to 4900. Sure I'm still a dependent so I'll get the difference back once tax returns come. ANYWAYS that's obviously a lot more money than I need, and as of now my parents are putting it all in the savings account at bank for college fund. However I'd like to have some cash for things like  buying bits of technology, going out to see movies, and the like. Of course my parents are willing to give me bits of money here and there, but I like the sense of independence having and financing on my own gives.

I definitely don't 'love her' like I used to, but I dream about her (not sexually), which I find really weird seeing as we haven't spoke for a year, as I said.\n\nSince then, girls have shown an interest in me. Two currently message me all the time, asking to meet up, etc, but I just can't get excited about it.

Katie and I are currently long distance for the summer since I live out of state and she + Nate live in our college town.\n\nFirst of all, Nate is the kind of guy who only hangs out with women. Every day at school he would eat lunch and dinner with the same group of 4 women, and until we started going out Katie would have most of her meals with them too. She started eating dinner with me when started dating and would eat most lunches with Nate + his group. Which was fine with me because I know it's healthy to not do every single thing with your girlfriend/boyfriend and I am not the jealous type, within reason.\n\nBut it seems like every single time Nate would go out out, he invited Katie along. Every movie, every late night Sheetz run, every study session, she would get the invite and go hang out with him and his little harem. Now that we are long distance and I'm not around, she is spending even more time with this group.\n\nNow, to the point of all this. She had told me she wanted to go to Nate's house to watch a tv show and I said okay. Then afterwords I find out through the conversation that they didn't watch it in the living room or other common area, but in his bedroom, sitting on his bed. This dude was sitting shoulder-touching-shoulder with my gf and this other girl on his bed for several hours. \n\nAm I wrong in thinking that this is out of line? I think it's common sense not to be in bed with another guy when you are in a relationship. Katie is annoyed at me because she does not see the difference between sitting next to each other on a bed and sitting next to each other on a couch, and she insists that they are just friends. Is this just a weak excuse? This is my first serious relationship and I am flying blind here. Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

He told me that he and his female friends were just friends and nothing had ever happened between them- and I trusted him and believed him for months. \n\nAround our one year anniversary he admitted that he's made out/felt up/fingered all of his female friends- literally every single one. He went as far to say that he still wishes he had gotten a blow job from one. I was incredibly angry that he lied but became even more angry when I thought about our relationship and the things he's done with them since then.\n\nHe won't be seen in photographs with me, he won't hold my hand when people he knows are around- let alone anything else, yet he'll hold them close in photographs. Last Christmas, he took a girl that he's friends with and had a fling with to pick out my Christmas gift. On top of this all, when we fight, he would trash talk me with these girls.\n\nI resent him for what he's done and that he's lied. But I really need help getting over it.

I thought this would be a great opportunity to have her be more open about her problems but even still, she just doesn't speak of them. She considered me as one of her best friends until we finally got together. She'd talk to me then whenever something would go wrong, but now she won't even say a word when I ask about it. I get the cold shoulder with the words of \"Nothing is wrong.\" or \"I'm fine.\" This is a little unsettling for me since she used to be able to talk to me about everything until we started dating. I do give her time to recover and calm herself before I ask her what is troubling her so deeply. Still, I just get no response about it. She'll carry on like everything is fine and back to normal. I don't know about you guys but wouldn't you find that something concerning in your relationship? I thought I'd feel closer to her now that we are dating and living in the same home, but she still pushes me away when an issue arrives in her life.

She had breast implant surgery last Thursday (Feb 18), and since she is a transwoman, she was also off her hormone treatment for a few weeks (although she is back on them, she warned me she might be extra emotional during that time). She might also be experiencing post-surgery depression (I seriously did not know that was a thing before this morning). She's in a state where she needs me to be emotionally supportive, and here I am planning on doing the exact opposite.\n\nSo reddit, here I am. Do I still breakup with her on Sunday?

I do a fair bit of texting and, let's face it, Facebook/Twitter/Vine. \n\nMy main question of concern is whether or not the new iPhone justifies letting go of the mp3 player. For the longest time, I always carried a separate MP3 player. Even now, I have an iPod Touch. I want to condense my technology but I listen to music almost nonstop (with exception of during classes and at work). I also play my music in the car during commutes, which also puts a drain on the battery.\n\nAll that said, the $99 16 gig price point looks attractive enough, and I actually prefer a bit of color added to the look of an otherwise drab phone. I just don't think I want to spend $199 for a fingerprint scanner. As I'm currently used to Android, my alternative choices were going to be either the new Moto X or the Google Nexus 4.\nTL;DR:"}

I get a warm fuzzy feeling inside when I'm with my boyfriend. And I get the same warm fuzzy feeling when I'm near my best friend. More than once I've been late for work because I was having a dream that me and my best friend were together. We met years ago, I had a crush on him at the beginning but he wasn't into me like *that*, so we became friends, then best friends. I can't help stare at him sometimes - he's beautiful! Sometimes I just want to grab him and kiss him, other times I fantasize that he would grab me and kiss me. I've been close to telling him everything a few times, when we get drunk, but I can never bring myself to do it. One time, some (sex) stuff happened between me and some other guy at a bar and my friend saw us and he rushed outside saying he was so grossed out he almost puked. I can never forget that, the time he admitted I'm disgusting to him. But I still see some twinkle in his eye when he sees me - it must be wishful thinking, right...?\nTL;DR:"}

How do I prevent this?\nPOST: A little background: from what little he will divulge, I have learned that my friend has had a very difficult past. While he is relatively high functioning (good grades with a good trajectory to a decent law school), he has  a bunch of problems clearly gnaw at his mental well-being He has a history of drug abuse starting at a young age (ie: meth, heroin, and coke in early high school) and he \"dabbles\" in coke and prescription amphetamines somewhat regularly. From what I know, heroin was a huge problem for him.\n\nJust recently I overheard him ask an acquaintance of a friend if he could procure heroin. Not only that, he is partaking in considerable coke binges ($300+ in one weekend) and recently spent 30+ hours in a hellishly strung-out nightmare of a withdrawal during a MDPV and MDMA shit-show. He seems to be getting dangerously close to, if not already, damaging his brain with a seemingly endless habit of getting 'fucked up'. \n\nI have addressed my concerns at a very rudimentary level, but given his overall stubbornness in justifying his habits with his difficult past, I am at a loss for an effective means to tell him to just slow down.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't have photos of him up at work and often people are surprised to learn I have a boyfriend because I never mention him.

However, due to an incident at work he is due for a significantly large payout. Now he has officially decided to leave the family after months of gambling and drinking away more money (the extent of his gambling was only discovered after he left).  \n\nMy mother wrote him a letter (signed by a solicitor) stating that all she wanted was half, after 30 years of loyalty she deserved that. But his solicitor is arguing that she is not entitled to half of the payout or half of the superannuation. (just the house which is now under a lot of debt). \n\nWe are going to fight but my mothers solicitor does not think we will get more than a 1/3. How this is just i dont know. This is due to my father claiming he is no longer able to work or earn a decent income, even though he has stated he can get a job in the mines for $200 000 a year. While my mother has no career potential due to her working casual jobs while looking after the children.\n\nMy question is what should i do? I am filled with so much hate for this man. It makes me sick to bear his name after what he is doing. My mum is a mess and is noticeably ageing and looking sick from the stress. \n\nCan you offer any insight or any personal experiences that might assist during this time?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Tried to teach \"walk without stopping to sniff;\" did I accidentally teach \"Stop and Sniff and you'll get a treat\"?\nPOST: My dog LOVES to sniff and mark on walks--every 10 feet it seems like he's back in the bushes again. Yes, walks can be for sniffing, but there are times when I want him to keep walking without stopping (eg when I am actually trying to go somewhere, or when he wants to sniff/mark something inappropriate). So, I set out to train \"let's go,\" meaning, \"stop that sniffing/peeing and keep walking.\" I thought that I could eventually use this to transition to a default \"no sniffing now\" heel. Here's what I did: \n1) when he started to sniff, pull him gently away and when he looked at me instead of the smell, click and treat. \n3) also click and treat when he looked at something like he *wanted* to sniff, but chose to keep walking\n4) randomly treat when he was walking in heel position to reinforce the \"right\" behavior\n\nSo, it's now about 80% reliable that I can call him away from sniffing/marking (assuming he doesn't find a dead gopher or something). Next, I started calling him away from all smells on walks, thinking that he would get the idea that \"let's go\" meant \"walk\" not \"sniff\" for the whole walk. But after months of calling him away from every smell on every walk, it seems he wants to sniff just as often as ever. \n\n--Is he now sniffing on purpose to get a treat? \n--Is sniffing more rewarding than food (probably) so he'll always want it?\n--Is there another way to teach the difference between times it's OK to sniff or not? Can I build on the work I've done in a different way? What can I try next?\nTL;DR:"}

I got up after only about 3 hours of sleep, feeling rather shitty. My wife and brother-in-law were prepping the house for the Halloween party we had planned, and I was tasked with making the sweet tea. Nothing to difficult, as I'm the designated sweet tea brewer most of the time. I set about making the tea, and my wife tells me to use the glass dispensers we had been gifted for our wedding. \n\nThis is where I made a series of stupid mistakes.\n\nThe tea reached boiling point, so I took it off the stove and set it aside to steep for a few minutes. I left the kitchen to go to the bathroom, came back and forgot to pour ice in the dispenser. I also forgot that one of the two dispensers had a fine crack toward the bottom, near the nozzle. \n\nI poured the hot tea into the cracked dispenser, and heard a resounding CRACK! Thinking I had bounced the pot off the rim, I stopped to check things out. Deciding all was well, I filled the remainder of the dispenser with water and finally noticed a small puddle of tea forming around the bottom of the dispenser.\n\nRealizing what had happened, I lifted the dispenser to move it into the sink and was soaked from the waist down in hot tea, flooding the counter, stove and floor in the process. The hairline crack near the nozzle had spread all the way around the bottom of the dispenser, so when I tried to move it, the bottom stayed put while the rest of the glass came free in my hands.\nTL;DR:"}

The police show up and ask for me, and as they are putting me in handcuffs, my supervisor interrupts them and tells them what happened. J had apparently bashed his face into a telephone pole in an attempt to frame me for beating him.

I have known a friend of mine for a few years now, and she has never been quite emotionally stable. A few days ago she attacked me and her mother, and when the police were called, decided to tell them that I \"abused\" her. Now, I would never do such a thing. Everybody knows that, including her family and mine. I gave up a lot of opportunities for the girl, and I care about her almost more than I care about anything else. I did not abuse her.\n\nThe police are not taking her claims seriously, due to her poor mental state. However, being attacked and threatened by somebody you care about so much, as well as having them try to crucify you, is very traumatic and stressful. I am still feeling the effects. I am distancing myself from her as much as possible, cutting her from my life completely. However, for lack of a better description, I almost feel as though this place is \"tainted\". I feel like a change of scenery will help me.\n\nSo, onto my question; would it be possible for me to leave my current life (no wife, no kids) and start fresh somewhere else?

He's currently working as a maintenance electrician for a big food manufacturing company in Toronto, Canada. Recently though he's felt a lot of pressure from his supervisor and he feels that his job has been put on the line and might be fired (just like one of his other colleagues at the company by the same supervisor).\n\nBecause of this, my dad has been under extreme stress everyday and has major problems sleeping. He's felt no more interest in cooking, eating, or taking care of his aquarium. He doesn't know what to do if he gets fired because he feels it's difficult to find a job because he has the \"old-world\" electrician skills while most places now want the \"new-world\" electricians who have much greater knowledge of computers and more modern machinery. He's about 10 years away from a 'comfortable retirement'.\n\nMy mom has been trying to hard to console him and making sure he's okay everyday but it only goes so far. I've tried to talk to him and spend time with him going on walks to try to talk it out but I don't know what advice to give. My mom has been trying to maybe find a psychologist to see if that might help but the wait time is until February 2012.\n\nI really want to help him out or give him some advice that will help him but I don't know what to say really so I'm seeking out for what advice you have reddit.

My sister openly hates her job and my work ethic at college has effectively pissed off to pluto. \n\nI'm failing two out of the three subjects I took, and am most likely about to get kicked out. This prompted me looking at other colleges and then, apprenticeships. I found the RAF apprenticeship site and discovered several courses that I qualify for. As I've been told, the RAF is incredibly prestigious about experience and a guaranteed career. If you can get in, of course. \n\nI have the option to leave now and go flat out for the RAF, but if I don't get in then I will be left with practically no qualifications, no job and very quickly, no friends no life and nowhere to live. If I do get in, I'll be leaving my life behind and all my friends to go abroad and all over the place to install comms and shit.\n\nI've been losing a grip on my life for the last three years, and I don't know what's going to happen in the next three months, but whatever does is probably not going to be fun. if I do get into the RAF, I'll have a long career that I'll most likely enjoy (eventually) that will get me high up qualifications and experience in the telecommunication and com-sat business.\nTL;DR:"}

Also the voluntary contribution differs depending on the field in which you're studying and you get upto a 10% discount for paying before certain dates.

She is graduating from her master's program and is applying to a lot of jobs in her field.

I called her up to share the good news immediately. \n\nAfter a few sentences of congratulations she immediately went into concern over what this meant for us and concern about the future. Lately I have felt like I've been dragging in mud with our conversations and, sadly, have even avoided a phone call or two. I'm worried and concerned about our future too but don't get the same reassurances from her. \n\nMaybe it's because I was riding such a high with the letter of acceptance but I was really frustrated following our last call.

It's always what he wants, what he needs, everything depends on his mood. If he is even slightly tired I can't get him to do anything,  to the point of cancelling plans. I have to mention he does not have a really stressful job, normal working hours, same as me. \nWhen I'm tired or even exhausted and can't do what he wants he says I'm boring. \n\nAlso he never offers to do anything for me that suggests he thinks about what I like or need. He would rather I walked alone at night (dangerous where i live) than take me there. \nWhile we were out, I got so exhausted once that I asked him to go back home or let me go on my own, and he just asked me nicely to stay there even while crying. Eventually he told me to go back alone at 1am when there were no buses left.\n\nHe also gets very affected by my bad moods which don't even happen that often. Everyone has a day off once in a while. But he is so affected by it that it makes me feel even worse.\nSometimes I feel like I have to always smile for him, like im always there only to make him feel better and entertain him. I want a partner that is there for me when I have an off day not make me feel even worse because of it.\n\nHe always takes note of every single penny that he spends, we split absolutely everything equally. I just wish maybe once in a while he would treat me to a cake or ice cream or anything ( I do).\n\nAm I being unreasonable or is he being unfair? I'm not sure if I'm taking things out of proportion.

Discussing alternatives or opening up our relationship.\nPOST: I've known my boyfriend for over a year now, and we started dating five months ago when we realized that we were falling for each other. We get along so amazingly well in so many ways, yet we have enough differences that things are kept interesting. We love each other deeply and have already had several challenges along the way.\n\nThe biggest challenge facing us is the fact that he's asexual, which I knew going into the relationship. My sex drive would be considered pretty much average. We've tried different ways to work around it, but the fact is he just doesn't have any desire for sex, and even when he \"services me\", his heart is just not into it. \n\nI did bring all that up to him, and I know that him being asexual is every bit just as natural as my sex drive. We did discuss opening our relationship so that I could have my sexual needs met, and he could have his voyeuristic tendencies met as well. Some rules include, he would need to \"screen\" who I end up with, no kissing or cuddling (all of those I suggested, as I want my kisses and cuddles to be reserved only for him!)\n\nWe have not actually moved forward with it yet. My biggest fear is that it could create tension and mistrust between us, especially since I'm the one that would be having sexual relations with someone else. I want to avoid breeding doubt and mistrust in our relationship. I love him dearly, and I love him for who he is. He is amazing in every way and I would not change a thing about him.\n\nI am very much capable of separating sex from anything else, and not allowing it to affect a friendship or whatnot. With that said, I would rather explore alternatives if possible before bringing in a third person.\nTL;DR:"}

They had talked about this between themselves and decided to tell us and bring the whole family up to speed. It caused a pretty big change in all of our lives and especially between my mom and dad.

It was definitely him and he is definitely looking to cheat again (He probably already has, we didn't read too far in). There are also various singles websites and hookup profiles with this fake name he created.\n\nHow do my brother and I go about bringing this up to my parents?

He came to visit me yesterday and it was the first time I had seen him since we broke up. \n\nI knew it wasn't going to be how it was when we were together but it wasn't what I was expecting. He stayed a good while and played with my son and when he went to bed we talked for about 2 hours on our own but it was just generic conversation you'd have with anyone. A couple of times we talked about or relationship and things we did together, but not much.\n\nWe are both very introverted people and when we first started dating before we were officially together we were both pretty shy and quiet around each other and that's how it felt between us yesterday. I know I was being cautious of not wanting to make things uncomfortable between us so maybe that was why. \n\nI still really love him and would do anything to get back with him but I'm unsure if this \"awkwardness\" between us is normal after a break up? Especially since we lived together for 4 months, we know so much about each other to be awkward with each other.\n\nNOTE; I'm not going to rush back into this relationship especially since my son is involved so don't say that, because I know. My son will always come first.\nTL;DR:"}

He used to be able to be around me for some time, and I have no problems with him today, but apparently he has, every time I'm around him he tells me to go away and when I speak to others he just stares at me with an ugly face. \n\nWe are both part of the same big sports club, we had done some practice together but not much more. Last fall our club had an end-of season \"recap meeting\" (party) with an overnight stay at a hotel/resort. It was a fun night, to say the least, and at 3am I found myself alone in a room with a female acquaintance who started touching me, and it didn't take long before we ended up in bed together. Throughout our sexual activity she kept talking about this other guy, that she had been looking for him, he had said he was coming to her room, that he didn't answer his phone or her messages, etc. We finished and I walked back to my room to get some sleep. The day after she texted me, asked if something inappropriate happened, that I shouldn't tell anyone, etc. She apparently promised to keep quiet as well. \n\nThen, when I met this guy again some weeks later, his demeanor had changed considerably, he was extremely unfriendly and hostile towards me, and this has continued up to today. \n\nI can only assume that this girl has told him what happened or that he has found out in another way, and that he had some sort of expectation or deal of having sex with her that night that wasn't fulfilled. That is only my assumption, but I can't think of any other reason behind his behavior towards me. \n\nHow should I approach this situation? Should I ask the girl whether she has told him, or if she knows that he has found out what I did with her? Should I confront him with whether the reason for his hate is the relation I had with this girl?\n\nThe whole origin of the incident is incredibly embarassing for me, I just want to forget it, but presumably there is at least one other person who hasn't forgotten it.\nTL;DR:"}

In addition to the obvious reasons, we have stressful jobs.  I am doing my residency in family medicine, and this being my last year, my time is pretty much consumed by finding a job and studying for my board exam.  He works for a small engineering firm that takes on big projects and is understaffed, resulting in him working 70-80 hour weeks sometimes.  We also have very different personalities and different ways of dealing with people and situations.  When depressed, I bury myself in netflix and reddit, and I have a tendency to stuff my feelings until I\"m about to explode.  He, on the other hand, becomes more outwardly tempermental, loses his temper, and becomes harsh and overly critical.  Long distance plus stressful work environments plus both of us being depressed = not a good combination.  I was considering suggesting to him that we take an 'unofficial break.'  This would involve us just taking a few weeks up to a month or two to just focus on ourselves and not worry about calling the other or trying to make the other happy.  I feel like I need it, because my depression in the setting of him being tempermental and harsh leads to me resenting him, and I don't want to end up hating him.  We were very good for each other at one point and I believe we still have that potential.  So my question is, is there any benefit to taking a break in a serious relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

He has never shown signs of aggression towards people and only shows aggression towards other dogs when it comes to his food (growling, never biting). We live down the road from a skate park and the kids are always harassing my dog through the fence, so, naturally, he hates skateboards. \n\nToday, on our daily walk, I was waiting at a crosswalk a couple blocks from downtown (Meatloaf was on a leash) and an 18 year old boy on a skateboard rode up to Meatloaf, jumped off his board and immediately started petting him without my permission. Meatloaf instantly jumped up, bit his face and then got down and walked away from him. The boy was left with a single puncture wound in his nose and one in his chin. \n\nLiving only a couple blocks from the incident, I offered to walk with the kid back to my home (he was headed that way regardless) and allow him to clean himself up and offered him a first aid kit. I offered him a ride to the hospital if he wanted to go, or a ride home, but he refused. I gave him my phone number and told him I would cover any medical bills if necessary.

By the time he would come he would have turned 18 and I would be 17. Our optimal situation is he lives with my family for a year and seeks work then moves out with me when I leave for University or College.

He is a source of negativity for me and has been abusive to me and my mom for the first 9 years of my life.\n\nEvery time he calls me, the call ends up with me hanging up feeling depressed. Sometimes I pick up the phone thinking that this call will be better... but it rarely is.\n\nI'm 16 years old now and I feel like I'm mature enough to understand that it's about time for me to cut ties with my dad. The only thing is that my mom is 100% against it. Even though she has gone through a lot of abuse, she insists that it's wrong to cut off ties with family members.\n\nWe had some heated debates about it, and I'm really angry at her for putting up with stupid shit like this. She says that I must forgive him, and I know that I have. There's a difference between not forgiving someone and cutting off ties because they make your life worse.\n\nSo should I cut ties with my father? If I missed anything, don't hesitate to ask!\n\nThank you. I already feel better after writing this :)\nTL;DR:"}

To be honest, I started this relationship feeling insecure. I love this guy dearly and gave in too much, like I compromise a lot. But at the same time, I have fears knowing my bf's track record of never having a solid relationship before he met me: a lot of datings, never really settled down. The longest relationship he has was 4-month long and the status of this relationship was not clear. He asked her out but never came into agreement about exclusivity. I heard that they parted ways when he discovered her picture with another guy in facebook.\nWith these insecurities I have, I have been trying so hard to convince myself that my bf has become a better person who is ready to have more commitment. However, there are a few issues that make this effort is even harder. Until today he never introduced me to his family saying that it is unnecessary. He is also very 'shady' about his past life. An example: In the beginning of our relationship, my bf accidentally spilled out stories about the girl whom he had 4-month relationship with, that he liked her a lot and it was like 'the one that got away'. I was hurt really bad because I started questioning whether he has moved on or not.\n All of these make me feel that I don't know where he came from, what made him he is today. I feel that everything is so shaky now.\nTL;DR:"}

She wants to start having kids now, but I want to make sure we are ready both emotionally and financially. Our marriage has been pretty good except when it comes to the bedroom. She doesn't enjoy making love to me, has basically done it just to fulfill my need, has often cried afterwards, and therefore had become a once a month thing, if that. Before marriage the sex was great and a non issue, but it has declined sharply once we got married. Everything else in our marriage is fine. We get along for the most part, and occasionally have an argument, but always come to a solution on everything , except this. Lately though, she has been more affectionate and has been wanting to have sex more often because she said she wants to get pregnant now, and my suspicion is that this will last until she is pregnant then the sex will end, and be back where we were if not worse. I told her that we need to talk about having kids and that we are not emotionally ready for them and now thinks I don't want to at all (which is untrue). I feel like I haven't enjoyed my wife sexually without the thought of kids, but at the same time, I understand it gets more and more difficult for her to have kids the longer she waits.

Whether you agree with his sentiments or not, the fact of the matter is that cross-posting does happen; that is, people do copy pasta content from one subreddit to another. \n\nIf you subscribe to the belief that this is stupid, then you must ask yourself, is this the fault of redditors or is this the fault of reddit.com?\nThe author seems to think that this is the fault of redditors, as he is making a post asking everyone to please stop.\n\nI believe that this is the fault of reddit.com. If reddit.com had better architecture, then things like this wouldn't occur. \n\nCurrently posts BELONG to subreddits. But this doesn't make sense because many subreddits actually have overlapping domains. A funny picture about a video game may belong in pics, funny, and gaming. I'm a software engineer, and this looks to me a lot like a software architecture problem.\n\nConsider this alternative architecture:\n\nImagine if subreddits were only channels for sharing posts; posts are associated with 1 or more subreddit, but do no belong to that particular subreddit. \n\nIf I made a new post, I would have the option of selecting which subreddits that particular post would be displayed under. So I post my pic and select pics, funny, and gaming. They move up and down within each subreddit independently, because ultimately subreddits are just filtered VIEWS of the total collection of posts. Now when someone clicks on the post from any of the three subreddits, it will take them back to the single comment thread, instead of having 3 different comment threads for 3 different posts.\n\nIf someone saw this post and also felt that it belonged in /r/trees, then instead of making a new posts, they would have the option of linking that post into /r/trees, instead of going there and creating a new submission. Once linked, it would move up and down that page just as if it were a new post.\n\nMy question is:\n**Does this alternative architecture solve the problem of cross-posts, or is there something that I didn't think of?\nTL;DR:"}

I am currently a university student and have absolutely no means to paying this. A few weeks following the accident, I was told by my insurance company that they will handle everything and I haven't heard word from my insurance agent about it since; so I assumed everything has been settled, until today when I received a summons.\n\nHere is what happened. On April 29 2014, I got into a car accident with someone at an intersection. There was a stop sign on the road I was driving on, I did not see the stop sign, I drove through, and collided with the other person. The intersecting road has no stop sign, so I was at fault for this accident. My car rotated 180 degrees and collided into the curb.\n\nRight after the collision happened, I immediately got out of my car to check if the other person was okay. She was crying and was in mild shock, but physically she looked fine. I asked her several times if she was okay, and she responded yes each time. Some nearby neighbors also went to console her. My car ended up being totaled, and there was almost no damage done to her car. After police showed up and report was filed, she seemed emotionally stable (and even waved bye to me), and was able to drive away fine.\n\nThe injuries listed in the complaint are body sprains/strains, muscle spasms, fatigue, and post traumatic headaches, and is asking for over $15,000 for it. To me, she looked perfectly fine and I do understand that there could be a possibility of aches developing after-the-fact; however, if you were to ask who was actually injured more in the accident, it would probably be me from judging how each car ended up.\n\nI know the first thing I should probably do is call my insurance agent, but is there anything else I should know?\nTL;DR:"}

How do I do it?\nPOST: So I have been powerlifting for a little over a year and a half. Sophomore year of school I joined the school's powerlifting team, and shortly after, I got my girlfriend into it. Needless to say, she loves the team atmosphere. I, on the other hand, was not a huge fan of many of the guys on the team and, coupled with the fact that I will be extremely busy come January, cannot afford to go to 4 hour long practices 3 days a week. So, I left. The problem is, my girlfriend and I will both be very busy come the spring semester (which starts in january) and powerlifting was going to be one of the ways we spend time together and for me to support her. Now, I will have trouble seeing her competitions and travelling alongside the team, not to mention I lose time with her during the week. So my question is.. how can I show her that I love and support her in this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

We were \"seeing\" each other, but not quite \"dating\".  About the middle of the summer, I decided to commit, but by then she wasn't into it.  After a couple of months we came back together, and realize that we are perfect for each other, though in the time we were apart she had made plans to move to California indefinitely.  Not for a career or anything, just for a change of weather (we live in the wintery parts of the midwest) and check out something new for a while.  \n\nI support her entirely.  Being just a little bit older, I've done what she's doing.  I get it, that point in life where you need to get out on an adventure of your own, and I would hate to pressure her to stay and later have her resent me for not going.  \n\nWe've since talked some about more clearly defining how long \"indefinite\" is, but she's set on at least a year.  \n\nShe has graduated college (BS apparel/textiles/minor in art), I have three semesters left (BA sculpture/AA business).  I also have a son from a previous relationship that lives in my town and I would be loath to move away from.\n\nI'm not asking if it's worth it, she is absolutely worth it.  I just don't know how best to handle this for the highest probability of success, and maybe some success stories.  Has anyone experienced a long distance relationship?

I am deeply in love with him but lately his actions make me welcome the thought of breaking up.

We don't get to see this friend much anymore so now he has moved on to saying the exact same thing about another mutual friend. I don't even think mutual friend is the appropriate word to describe them. I think acquaintance is better because my conversations with either of these guys has never gotten past \"Hey how are you?\" \nI feel like the only thing I can do is tell him that he's the only one I want to be with because that's the truth. His response to that is he knows I'm not perfect and he can't believe that I've never talked (romantically) with anybody else during our relationship. I have given him permission to go through my phone and all of my social media and when he finds nothing he says that's not enough because I can delete things.\nI have no idea how to get through to him and as I'm typing all of this out I'm getting more and more scared that I'll never be able to get through.

The thing is, now she says she doesnt want to label our relationship, but we are doing everything a couple usually does. The only thing that bothers me is that I want to be her boyfriend and I want her to be mine. \n\nSomething that should be known is that she has had a rough childhood and a broken family that really just got their pieces back together, but during that time she made some really awful decisions that she told me last year and hen we were going out such as cheating on her old bf and lying to her parents and going to the city and partying with people way older than us.

Im in varsity too, so I talk to him a good amount (theres only 7 varsity runners), and he pisses me the fuck off like crazy, but last night I had a dream where we were in a relationship and we were kissing and stuff and i woke up like 'what the fuck?!?!'. NOTE - im gay, he knows this, and while he isnt homophobic, he makes gay jokes all the time and calls people (not me though) fags and stuff (he makes fun of jews and white people too since hes the token black kid and he thinks that means he can be racist). anyways, why did i have this dream? i really hope i dont have a crush on him and im kinda worried because it didnt really feel strange or anything in the dream??? has anyone dealt with something like this before that can help me? thanks in advance\nTL;DR:"}

He said it was a way that he could see what people form his hometown were up too, which is probably BS because all these ladies only post lingerie and bikini photos. \n\nHe also follows my family members so I told him that I didn't like him liking these girl's photos when everyone can see that he is doing it. \n\nSo I deactivated my instagram for a while and then decided that I had taken a long enough break and reactivated it only to see that my boyfriend was continuing to follow tons of scantily clad women and liking their photos for the world (and my family members, friends, and his friends) to see.\n\nWe had another issue with him not respecting me in front of other people so I would say this was the last straw. I sat him down with the intention of discussing it before coming to a conclusion and fixing the problem so I told him how I was uncomfortable with his social media habits. \n\nHe didn't really see a fault in liking women's butt/bean/boob pics so I told him I didn't want to be in a relationship anymore.\n\nHe really thinks I made a mistake, thinks I'm making a mountain out of a molehill and wants me back ...but I just felt like it was a clear indication that he didn't respect me and our relationship.\n\nI don't know if I overreacted anymore and am having a hard time staying strong in this breakup.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: My 16 year-old pregnant sister is living with the father-to-be and I've just found the relationship is emotionally abusive\nPOST: I picked up my sister last night because I had been told there was arguing and she didn't feel like staying there the night. We talked for a few hours and I learned that the father-to-be (who is 20) is possessive and manipulative in order to keep her inside the apartment/speaking with other people. When he has friends over, he will immediately try to get her to not speak with them. I believe he treats her in a way that makes her seem unworthy to him or his family. When I picked her up, she seemed like the shell of someone I used to know--very quiet, lethargic, etc. And the family feels like she's \"running away with the baby\" when she leaves like this, making her feel guilty for trying to catch a breath of fresh air here at home. \n\nMy question is: what can I do about this? I want to help, but I have never experienced something like this. It almost seems like depression that has been set on by constant arguing and feeling inadequate. Is there a professional she can speak with to help her? What do I do about the abusive partner? Should she stay with his family and work things out? Any help is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

She's really nice to me, she always cares about my feelings, and she tells me she loves me a lot. I make sure to tell her that I love her as well, because I really do love her. I care about her a lot, and her happiness means the world to me. I feel safe with her, I feel loved and cared for in a way that I've never felt with anyone before.\n\nBut her and I don't really share many interests. We have the same values and the same personality, but we don't share any of the same hobbies, nor do we like discussing the same things. We can talk about our feelings very openly and honestly, there's no problem there, but there's not much beyond that. We can't be together physically most of the time, so all we can do is Skype or talk over the phone, which means that all we have is our conversations. They usually result in silence. Neither of us minds the silence much, but I'm afraid that someday I will care, that I'll get sick of it and will start to crave some deep conversation. That's what scares me, I don't want to get too invested into her and then realized that things won't work out, and more than that I don't want to waste her time. \n\nI'm also afraid that I'm going to be missing out because of this. I've never had a girlfriend before her, and I'm afraid I'll miss out on perhaps having a partner that I have genuine and interesting conversations. But I'm also afraid that I'd be making a big mistake if I broke up with her. Because like I said, I care a hell of a lot about her, and she's so sweet and kind to me - and I know that's not something you can find easily in this world. I don't want to lose such a great and terrific person over something that could be so petty.\nTL;DR:"}

My ex and I broke up around 2 months ago because he was having doubts about our connection/not feeling \"in love.\" We were about to be apart for 2 months with him traveling all of March and me away most of April. Besides for him not having strong feelings, we had a really good relationship and he admitted during the break up that he wasn't completely sure he was making the right decision but felt too guilty keeping me in a relationship for 8 months without knowing for sure how he felt. He really wanted to stay friends and talked a bit about how we might still have potential.\n\nA month ago, at the very end of March, when he returned to our city and shortly before I left for my trip, I told him that I still had feelings for him and wanted to work things out. He turned me down telling me that he wanted to date around, had kind of met someone and kissed her, and was starting to feel reluctant to be friends as I still had lingering feelings and it might be too complicated.\n\nDuring my trip we continued to email sporadically and he liked a lot of my pictures on Facebook. I got back to our city on Monday night and on Tuesday morning he asks to meet up this weekend to catch up. I agree and today we met for coffee. We caught up for an hour laughing and having a good time. Then he tells me that 3 weeks ago he got an email that my favorite band was coming to town and immediately bought us tickets to go. He knows this band is really meaningful to me. The show is on Wednesday night.\n\nReddit, I still have feelings for this guy. I want to get back together.

Three years ago I was taking two of the bare minimum pre-requisites required, English and Algebra. Then some family issues came up and I had to quit for the time being. I've been ready to go back to school for these past two years, but haven't due to the fact that I simply cannot make up my mind on what I want to do for my career. In my school, when I originally signed up, I had to tell the advisor what I wanted to do as a career before anything else. Just so that they can get my pre req's figured out and assign me to the classes needed. That's really all that is holding me back right now; I can't make up my damn mind. \nI've got it narrowed down to three different paths. Two are in the medical field, one is a food/hospitality path. My parents are pushing for ANYTHING in the medical field, because there will always be work and it's usually good money, too. But I feel like my passion would be the other choice, Baking and Pastry Arts. I feel that my creativity would run wild and I would love it. But I want to be guaranteed a job; yeah people will always need cakes and pastries professionally made but I think people would need medical personnel more.

I felt bad that I was crying on one side of the screen while he just looked at me with a grin on his face.\n\nI wanted to break up, and a big reason was that I don't think he deserves a girl who cheats on him (I did say this to him). I was ready to discuss things that I don't think we are compatible in case he wanted to ask, but he didn't ask and I didn't feel like it was necessary to flood him with two pieces of bad news (that I cheated on him plus that I wanted to break up..). \n\nI've finally returned to my country and haven't really contacted my bf since that googlehangout call. He doesn't have texting (so we dont' communicate that way), but I did get a couple emails from him. One was the regular update email that he writes for friends and acquaintances (he doesn't use FB either), and the other one is a few pics of what he was up to over the weekend for fun (street fairs, etc). I haven't responded to either.\n\nThis week that I've returned, I've been crazy busy with work and family matters. He called today and suggested meeting up. Whereas he wanted us to meet at his place and asked me to stay at his place, I declined.. He asked why, and all I could manage to say over the phone was that being at his place can lead to other expectations and I wasn't ready for it. Oh and that my period came early.

I don't have any skeletons in my closet that come up, I don't think I change my behavior that much when the topic of getting serious comes up. Maybe I come off as a little needy?

But recently they've been worse than ever, my mum started sleeping in my old room and they barely speak (don't fight much but that's because they don't talk enough to fight). Believe it or not, what sparked this recent deterioration was my dad going to the cinema with other people who weren't my mum, I get why that might be upsetting but I don't think worth this reaction.\n\nI have a younger brother (14, still lives at home) and sister (19, lives part time at home), and I have moved out but still go home for a few days quite regularly. I don't know if my brother has realised what's going on, my sister certainly knows. I totally accept if they want to get a divorce, but they won't do anything to either make the relationship better or get a divorce. \n\nI spoke to my mum about it and she said she 'knows' my dad doesn't care enough to go back to counselling But she's not actually asked him). I think it's more likely that my dad feels too awkward and nervous to bring it up, as he's not a very social guy. My question is what I could do to encourage them to do something to make themselves happier (even if that means getting a divorce), or if I should just stay out of it.\nTL;DR:"}

We live in a big city in central Europe, but my father has a farm on the outskirts and visits us once or twice a week (parents aren't divorced or anything), so spending birthday time with my father was a no-brainer.

I've always been a good person and treated others well, helped them whenever they needed (i know my way around IT pretty good, so I get to fix or clean someone's shit once in a while) and always tried to wish my friends happy birthday, at least on Facebook. Now... I know, that some of my friends are off to a vacation or in any other circumstance in which they are unable to wish me and I'm aware of it, but many are online and even posting shit, yet not even a word appeared on my wall. What even adds to it is that one girl who's had a birthday a few days ago (i wished her) and who's PC I'm currently fixing at home, doesn't give two shits as well. Some of you might stop reading past this line, but I live in Europe for 13 years, yet I was born as a Russian, and they are quite known for being friendly and huge when it comes to throwing family parties, me included. Some of my friends have already asked me about whether or not I will be organizing one (prior to this day), yet, again, not even a single word from them.\nWell, at this line post might sound like a attention whore crying, but it's not - I'm just truly shocked. It's quite a milestone (18) and my bday date is easily remembered, as you can see by the date. Maybe it's because it is a holiday Saturday, dunno. Nevertheless, the only people that wished me (beginning with the morning) were my parents, my grandparents (the only Russian ones left), my two closest friends and my girlfriend.\nTL;DR:"}

After graduating someone offered me a chance at a business startup overseas. I took it. Wasted 2 years as the project never took off for multiple reasons: primarily because of legal paperwork, and the two investing parties just didn't play well together. \n\nThen I moved back home and helped a friend in the food business. He offered me a partnership, so I took it. Didn't have to put anything down, just had to put the hours in, which I did. We weren't making any money, and the guy couldn't afford to the upkeep, so that shutdown. Another 2 years down the drain. And definitely don't want to go back to the food biz. Whilst I was doing that, I started volunteering with a charity, and after about a year, they offered me a job. I only volunteered a few hours a week. Anyhow, landed a contract with them (basic reception work), contact ended, funding ran out, and nothing since then.\n\nI've been out of work for almost 6 months, on welfare, trying to volunteer with places which might turn into a job, but no such luck.

It's 7:45 and schools going to begin, so i choose out three books and head to check them out to read later. I just notice after almost an hour of reading there is not a single living soul in the library and i take off my headphones to investigate. Big mistake. Once I took them off, nothing could prepare me for the loudest alarm I've ever heard in my life. I got so scared I sharted and started crying, wondering why this is happening.

If I by accident offend anyone with my post, I apologize in advance.\n\nWhen I got together with my boyfriend around three years ago, I revealed to him my sexual history, which I had felt a bit ashamed of as I had been rather promiscuous in the past. To my surprise, he was completely fine with my past and did not judge me whatsoever. To my even greater surprise, he confessed that, despite being a virgin, he had had oral sex with his male friend once before. This was not something I expected to hear, especially as he came off as slightly homophobic before to me. Like I said, I have nothing against gays or bisexuals, and I don't think that he did anything wrong. Still, dating someone who has a homosexual side is simply not something that I am attracted too (which is entirely my own problem). Anyways, since he had been so accepting of my own history, I just told him that I didn't mind at all and he reassured me that he was straight and it was a one time thing.\n\nBesides his one-time experimentation, another thing that concerns me is his interest in trying on makeup and sexy dresses once in a while when he comes over and I'm putting them on for a night out.

Yeah, I could just straight out ask him, but I don't want him to feel ashamed for sharing his secrets with me.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [20 F], is fine with other guys calling her \"baby\", \"babe\", and other pet names\nPOST: For a while now, I've felt fairly uncomfortable about something in my relationship. My girlfriend has a lot of guy friends, which is fine by me, but a lot of them still seem to flirt with her even though she has been with me for around 6 months now. A while back I was sitting next to her in bed and noticed that she messaged \"I love you!\" to somebody else on new years eve. I asked who it was, and she said it was just a friend who she was really close with throughout her senior year of highschool. Since then, I've learned that he calls her baby on a regular basis, but she says \"that's just his personality\". \n\nHowever, it's not just him. There have been a few occasions where someone has called her \"baby\" or something along those lines, and she has just brushed it off as \"that's just how they are\". Personally, I'm uncomfortable with this but I don't want to ask her to tell them to stop because I don't want to make her friendships with the other guys awkward just because I'm being a little jealous. She calls another guy \"love\", and has called other girls \"babe\" in the past since we've been together (she's bi).\n\nAlso, the other day her friend was talking to her about birth control and asked how \"big her tits grew\" as a result of it.\n\nBasically, I want to know if I'm being overly jealous or if I should have a conversation with her about this behavior. I personally feel that just because someone acts a certain way, it doesn't mean she has to encourage it or not say that it's not okay for them to call her baby or other pet names, but that's just me.\nTL;DR:"}

I am abroad now for work, she at home.\nToday she was texting me in the morning that she had a dream about cheating on me with another girl, and that she even had orgasm in that dream that woke her up. We were talking about it and she admited she liked it a lot. After like hour of texting (and me convicing her that Im ok with it) she admited that that fantasy turns her on, althought she never even thought about it before. The dream just let it all out. She never had any bisexual experience except one kiss with friend.\n\nShe now accepted that we might bring another girl to bed, but she is quite jelaous. She stated sevral times before that thought of me having sex with another woman would brake her heart, and it still pressists after this dream. She and I are ok with her having sex with another girl while I would watch, but later she was talking about me having sex with her  from back while the other girl woul be pleasing her from the front, which Im okay with too. \n\nWe are now both pretty much excited about this, even though I know I wont be allowed to please / get pleased by that other girl.\n\nI would like to ask if you have any experience with this situation.

However, I don't have medical insurance until February so I wanted to ask you guys who have been through this what may have happened and whether or not this is serious.\n\n**Background:** I've been running since June and had worked up to about 4.5 mile runs. Then December came and I became very busy and the weather was never good so I stopped running for about two weeks. Friday of last week I finally mustered up the gumption to begin running again. I lengthened my previous route by stopping at the nearby high school and doing some sprints and lunges across the track, a combined four laps, and then took the longer way home. This all added up to about 6 miles, although I walked a bit of that time. Also I have really shitty Nike tennis shoes that are about 4 or 5 years old, and the road I was running on is sloped down on the left side (injured foot) this might have contributed to the injury.\n\n**The Injury:** When I came back after my run I noticed my foot had a bit of pain in it. I thought nothing of it until the pain began to increase that night, and much more the next day. It only hurts when I walk on it. When I'm sitting down it feels perfectly fine. It has been about three days since my run and the pain is still at the same level. The pain feels like its on the metatarsal bone close to the outside of my left foot. I end up having to walk on my toes or the inside of my foot, but that is still painful.\n\nHas anyone had this problem before? Is it serious enough to go to a doctor or should I just keep resting it? Pain doesn't bother me much but I'm afraid it might be a stress fracture or something more serious that I will mess up my foot if I don't go to a doctor.\nTL;DR:"}

Because of living in fear constantly in the city we lived in, wondering if I was going to see my abuser I did not go out frequently, and when I did it was always in \"safe\" places, well my husband and I decided to move to a new city to get away, and because the houseing market is much better where we wanted to go.\n\nFast forward to now, we have moved and are renovating our house, I am much better despite the PPD which I am now on meds for, and I am dealing with my past abuse and healing, I am much healthier and happier than I have been in years, the only thing missing is that I have no friends, my few friends live far away or have just grown away from me, and I seem to have lost that wonderful ability of children to just see someone and become friends with them. I want friends my own age or slightly older who are in the same sort of life phase as me. Most of my peers seem shallow and self absorbed (not to say that I am not sometimes, I just hate the drama) but people who are on the same maturity level as I am do not have young children my sons age. \n\nPlease help, how can I move past my past start making friends again and having a social life, I feel like having mommy friends will help my PPD but I have no idea how to go about meeting those types of people without knocking door to door, which seems rude. TIA, and btw there is really only one mommy group that I know of in my area and they are all much more of the \"hoity toity\" types in much higher tax brakets that sort of thing so I am not really comfortable there or feel like I fit in.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't expect to potty train her right away and I don't expect her to totally understand when she has to go. My problem starts here:\nShe used to tell me when she felt like peeing or when she was already peeing, which isn't a big deal to me as she usually told me she had to poop seconds before starting. Sometimes, even after. She sometimes gave me false alarms about having to pee and once I sat her down imitating peeing noises before saying she's done lol...\n\nFast-forward and it has been two maybe three weeks now and she doesn't say anything. She doesn't tell me she's peed or pooped. She used to feel uncomfortable with soiled diapers but now stays completely quiet about it. Luckily I check her often and change her diaper accordingly but I'm still confused, pull-ups used to get her excited but now it's like she's become lazy. Not it a bad way it just makes me worry. Is there an explanation for this? She's also been asking for an excessive amount of milk lately and I feel like she's reverting herself back to the \"baby\" stage.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been in a relationship with [23/f] and we hit a bump.\nPOST: First time poster here! I'm sure this'll get some mixed opinions, but here goes! So 3 years ago i ment this amazing woman online. I had a rough time in my old house and she wanted to get me out of there and I've lived with her since(this was 3 years ago). We were flirting mostly online and talked like we were in love but it was always up in the air. We ended up after some awkward days after I moved in being together amd have been happy for a long time. However recently in the past 6 months she and I kind of drifted a bit far apart from work and from her being a bit too obsessed with games. She'd stay up really late after I went to bed and play with our friends most of whom were men. Recently she opened up to me and told me she is decently certain she didn't have feelings for me this whole time and that she fell for someone online (a good friend to both of us). Now she also said she never enjoyed sex and also was sure she wants to break up. I convinced her to just deal with a break and space so I moved my desk and etc into the living room because tbh we always were suffocating each other due to our various roommates being just rude. Now I know for a fact fact enjoyed the sex because some days we went at it like rabbits, others we didn't. I know she loves me because she even now acts concerned for my well being and even admitted she was happy with me in our 3 years. My mother told me to be here for her and fight for her because it's a doubt phase and the people who have been there her to talk to (people she fell for and felt trampy about) have filled a void. I just wanted an outside opinion.\nTL;DR:"}

I was never a priority to him and he said some pretty cruel things to me that really affected my self-esteem.

I like him and I know that he really likes me, but I can't seem to get the ex out of my head. I haven't talked to him since we broke up (it was a really clean breakup, no contact since then), but I can't help but think of him whenever anything significant happens (not to mention that almost everything here reminds me of him since he was my first relationship since I moved to Montreal). I removed him from all social media outlets a long time ago, but I still find myself checking up on him in other ways (he has a pretty big online writing presence that I still follow occasionally) - I know that I need to stop this. It's all really putting a damper on my new potential relationship, and I really don't want to mess this up.\n\nSo basically, what is wrong with me?

This is what they've observed, and it's not like what they're saying is total garbage.

I wanted to join her, but since my schedule is a bit different, I ended up eating 1 sandwich and drinking lots of water Friday, then indulging in a few chicken wings in the evening.\n\nNow here's the tricky part, I actually lost 2 kg after that day, I weigh myself every morning before breakfast ( I know, shouldn't do it so often, but I'm judging myself normally weekly, trust me on this ). Normally I just sit around the 115 kg, sometimes 114, sometimes 116, but this time I lost 2kg in one day, and the best thing is that they haven't come back either, instead, following this way of losing weight actually made me lose another kg over the weekend, this is more progress than I've ever seen.\n\nSo the downside: Loose (hanging) skin.

But we also had some disagreements about timing (e.g. when to marry, have kids, settle down).\n\nWell, we were both struggling with not seeing each other very often and we felt we were drifting until last night when we ended it. I wasn't caught totally by surprise but I also wasn't ready for it to happen either.\n\nThe saddest part to me is that if we were able to be physically together I think it would have lasted. The relationship was really great when we could be together, but this increased distance was causing lack of intimacy. For the past week (pre-breakup) I was feeling down because I hadn't been able to hold her in so long. \n\nHow do I deal with an ending that seemed so un-final? To me, there was no substantive reason for the break up (I recognize that maybe her feelings truly did change and she just didn't say so to spare my feelings). I'm worried that I'll get bogged down in trying to rekindle things or holding out hope that we can get back together down the line because that's what I truly want... less than a month ago we talked about getting married soon. The end seemed so squishy that I can't find footing to get on the road to recovery.\nTL;DR:"}

The place is tiny, it fits ten people shoulder to shoulder at most and it's currently occupied by no less than 15. As I barge into the place I cause a rather large and angry looking man to spin around and almost lose a carton of 'chips n cheese' all over the floor.\n\nHe curses me and so I head outside for a look at the guy who just called me a cunt. Upon meeting eye to eye he politely asks \"Who the fuck do you think you are mate, fancy trying that shit again?\" \n\nI now see that this guy is a giant who has just handed his carton of  tasty goods to his friend. This is not about to go down well for me and so out of nowhere I place a hand on his arm and ask,\n\"Brother, do you believe in the lord?\" His bedazzled look is just what I planned for. \"You see brother, the good lord sent me here tonight for you. It was my place to bang into you and cause you to almost drop your food.\"\n\n\"And why the fuck would he do that?\"  he asks, in a confused yet, still slightly angry manner.\n\n\"because brother, I see that tonight not one chip was lost to the floor, nor was a single bit of your fine chedder.\" *I raise my voice higher here* \"The lord my brother, sent me here, to let you know that no matter what, he does not intend for you to go hungry tonight. He wants you to take up your fill and be content with the meal that has bestown upon you.\"\n\nAt this point, the poor fucker is almost cross eyed with confusion. here he was ramping up for a fight and I went all holy mary on him. Everyone but him can see plain as day I have just ripped the piss out of a man twice my twice, but the nature of the conversation has him so dumb founded, he blinks, mutters to his friend and walks off. I got to keep my face that day.. and some random lovely chap bought me a kebab for making his night with such a speech.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Parents of Reddit:  What is the best way you have communicated to your child?\nPOST: I am currently 21 years old, but I have been thinking about this question for quite a while now.  I have known people who enjoy the idea of a child, but once they have a child they have no idea on how to raise it.  And when they become older and more conscious of their own opinions towards certain topics the question is \"How was a parent really get through to a child?\"  I have seen so many kids who end up going down a bad path, despite what their parents warn them about or try to help them with, they just won't listen. Even when I was younger I often found myself fighting with my parents about things I thought was right from my point of view, however ended up being very wrong after I experienced it myself.  \n\nOne day I found myself spending a really long time contemplating the idea on how to best approach my children in the future, if I end up having any. So I created a set of videos of myself explaining certain topics directed to my children.  Each topic is roughly centered around different adolescent benchmarks, for example in some videos I discuss what to expect when you first enter High School and what my preconceived notions of High School were, another video discusses bullying, things I wish I would have done in high school, personal mistakes I have made (financially, in relationships, and so on).  The idea behind this was mainly driven by the idea that if I could approach my kids from a younger perspective, that it would have a greater impact on them instead of the old cliche \"When I was your age...\" line.  \n\nNow the question I'm interested in is how do other parents effectively reach their kids and prevent them from making costly mistakes?\nTL;DR:"}

I've never had any reason to not trust him and I've always trusted him completely. He went to Europe at the beginning of the semester for 6 weeks for school reasons with some of his friends in his major. I heard rumors when he came back that he tried to \"get with\" one of the girls while he was there. He denied that anything happened except some \"regretful\" (and unsuccessful) advances he made towards her. He said he was just lonely and he made a mistake. I believed him but I lost some trust in him.\n\nRecently, he's been hiding his computer and phone whenever we're together (I've never gone through any of his things so this is odd to me) and he seems to be constantly texting one of his other girl friends (which is not normal behavior). They hang out quite a bit when I go to work and am busy and now that I trust him less since he came back from Europe I'm very worried. I don't know how confront him. I feel that confrontation would just end badly. He tends to shut down completely and not communicate when I confront him about anything. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Unsure of what to do next.\nPOST: I'm 22 and I graduated with my B.A in English Education earlier this year in the spring. I originally wanted to be a teacher, but after going through my first semester of my teaching credential courses, I unfortunately discovered that my passion for teaching just wasn't there anymore. I was frustrated by the process, how poorly new teachers and students are evaluated, and so on.\n\nPrior to graduating, I had worked on-campus as a subject tutor for about two years. I think I was pretty lucky enough to land my first real job, a temp-to-hire job in September, working as an administrative assistant through a job agency. However, they decided to end my contract because of the days I had missed due to sickness. I deal with depression and I've been dealing with a lot of family issues, so I'm sure that contributed to how much I was affected by being sick. I basically ended up missing work for about a week, even though I had informed them of the issue.\n\nI'm completely at a loss for what I should do now. Of course, I'll keep applying to jobs and let  my job agency help me out, but I just feel so much pressure right now from my parents to find a full-time job. It doesn't help that I don't even know what career I want to pursue anymore. Ideally, I would want to become involved in social media/marketing, but something along the lines of copywriting, editing, or technical writing would be great as well. I know a career is hard to find when I'm lost, but I just don't know what to do in terms of finding a job to support myself right now.\nTL;DR:"}

Back in High school my \"first love\" cheated on me, which made my teen angst rage, then I quickly started dating a sweet guy to bounce back and he cheated on me too. After all of that I decided to avoid men all together.\n\nFast forward 4 years, I am in college now far away from home.

I want to marry this man. \n\nHe knows I have anxiety about cheating and he is very good at easing my mind. But he is a few years older than me and he is graduating this semester (It will be 2 more years for me) and most of the job prospects that he is looking at are a few hours away. I'm encouraging him to take the best job he can get and to move away because I know it's what he needs to do. But my anxiety is going crazy. I've started having nightmares and panic attacks again. I'm completely terrified that I'm not good enough and he will meet someone else.\n\nAny tips or advice on how to deal with this? I'm especially curious about guys in the same situation as him.

Been feeling a little bit lonely over this lately. I've been told before that I am an extremely friendly person, so the fact that my personality isn't too shitty makes me wonder if there's simply something wrong with my appearance (AKA girls find me ugly). I've become very bitter when by myself.\n\nI'm a very tall 6'3\" and lanky. I hear a lot of stuff online and elsewhere about how girls supposedly like tall dudes. See for me this is like a curse - I've become very self-conscious about my height, to the point that I wish I was shorter. Honestly feel like being so tall and skinny makes me intimidating to girls. In addition, maybe being a minority (I'm black) also severely limits my dating pool and contributes to people's perception of me as unattractive. Even at this height I absolutely NEVER get 'checked out' by women - not even so much as a smile. Quite the opposite, many girls truly act like they are repulsed be me. At this point I just am starting to think that I'm the complete opposite of what the majority of women find even remotely attractive. Just feel kind of undateable right now.\nTL;DR:"}

For example, last night we got into a fight where we were both at fault. I felt taken for granted and (from what I gather) he felt I overreacted and said some hurtful things.

She told my female friend, M, that she didn't care if it had happened before she moved here, because she'd been sleeping with someone else too up until then. She later told J that she hadn't slept with anyone. He recently found out what she said to M and was mad that we hadn't told him earlier, even though we didn't know she'd said she hadn't slept with anyone. (We thought he knew she had.) Now she tells J that she was lying to M to try to get her to tell her more information.\nThe day after everything happened, M and I were on the phone with her and she said J told her the cheating stopped in May (it hadn't) and we were both pissed so we started answering her questions. She turned around and told J that she didn't ask anything and that I just started telling her things (it wasn't even me on the phone). J says he didn't tell her things ended in May and that she must've lied about that to get more information out of us.\n\nI honestly believe she was sleeping with other people before she moved here (they weren't official, and she lived out of town for several months while they were talking). But that's beside the point. Either way she lied. The only question is if she lied to us (J's best friends) or to him.\n\nI'm annoyed with him for not seeming to care at all that she's been lying. Because there is no question about if she lied (she even admitted it to him about what she told M).

Apparently, their relationship has been abusive for the last two years. After the fight, the abusive friend ran away, and hasn't been home since.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: How do I balance including an asocial BF while not being isolated from my friends?\nPOST: So I have been dating my BF for just under a year now. He is a fantastic, smart, grounded, creative, trustworthy guy. Sometimes he has issues showing/expressing emotion, but so do I, so I can't judge. When we hang out, our conversations and personalities seem to just click. I have never been as comfortable or open with another person and I think I love him.\n\nHere is the issue. He doesn't really have friends of his own. It's because he can be a bit of a bossy jerk at times, but he has no problem admitting it and I have no problem telling him to get off it. But sometimes, if I think about the future and possibility of us splitting, I worry that he won't handle it well. I don't want to break up with him, but I suppose I worry that if I ever did, he might become too co-dependent on my company...or that I might feel obligated to stay.\n\nHe is really clever and funny and I know if he gave people the chance to get to know him by not being so shy and quiet around strangers, people would really like him. It sounds so awful, but I want that to happen partially because when I go out with my friends I want to invite him and certainly don't want to exclude him, but I know I will have much less fun because I will feel obligated to entertain him at the price of having a blast with my friends...who I don't see as often.\n\nI guess I want general advice from people about my situation or to hear about any similar relationships they had...or also just to vent. I struggle with whether or not the awesome times we have together alone are worth the isolation I feel from everything else. At what point does it become not worth the compromises I'm making?\nTL;DR:"}

He makes significantly more money than me and offered to buy my ticket if I paid for the hotel and some activities. \n\nWe purchased refundable plane tickets  last week and he is really excited as he has not traveled out of the US before. The trip has dominated all of our conversations.\n\nEvery time I think about it, I get stressed out because I know I cannot afford this trip.

I am stressed to the point where this is keeping me up at night.\n\nHow do I tell him that I may not be able to pay for the hotels, etc without crushing his spirits?\n\nI'm pretty sure that he would be able to pay for all of the trip expenses for both of us but I feel very uncomfortable with this because I take pride in being an equal partner in our relationship and do not want to take advantage of his financial situation. I also fear this would upset the balance of our relationship in the future. \n\nI'm ashamed enough of my financial situation and don't want the additional judgement from him (and our friends if we cancel).

It is a very small facility and can only hold about 15 dogs on a nice day (A few of the kennels are outside. Right now it is very cold in Ohio so these kennels cannot be utilized.)\n\nSince it is a county facility, they are required to take in all dogs that are brought in/reported and picked up. If they run out of room, they begin to euthanize. It absolutely breaks my heart to see them make \"RIP\" posts on their [Facebook page] \n\nThe rate at which dogs are killed at the pound has reduced quite a bit over the years due to the love and dedication of our very passionate volunteers. However, every dog deserves the chance at a better life.\n\nYou can vote for the Trumbull County Dog Kennel via the following link:  and in order to find the shelter, put in Trumbull County Dog Kennel for the name and OH for the state. If you cannot find it that way, put in OH for the state and Warren for the city. It is currently the fourth one on the list. \n\nIf you would like to make a donation directly to the Trumbull County Dog Pound, here is their information: 7501 ANDERSON AVE, WARREN, OH 44484 (HOWLAND TOWNSHIP) Phone: 330-675-2787 Hours: Mon-Fri 9:30 am to 4:30 pm, Sat 9 am to 1 pm\n\nThank you all so much for taking the time to read this post, and especially for doing what you do to help homeless dogs in need.\nTL;DR:"}

It was some weird circumstances, but whatever, i'm moving on.\n\nI was getting over her, and feeling pretty good.

It was one step forward, two steps back.\n\nI can't help but feel like she's just manipulating me - trying to set up a friendship where she retains the perks of being in a relationship with me. The emotional support, mainly. When she talked to me that first time in three weeks, she did open up to me about recent events, and of course I comforted her. That's just what I do, regardless of who it is. It's different with her though, because I was the only person emotionally available to her for the past 6 months (we went out 4 months). This is what worries me. Nobody is there for her now, and I feel she is using me.\n\nI agreed that we can be friends (though it was more so I could test the waters, and see if it's viable yet), and we haven't talked since that moment. It's been a week. It makes me feel like she'll talk to me when she needs me, and not because we're friends.\n\nI want to be there for her, but if she's using me, and if it compromises the way I feel, then I'll have to tell her to leave me alone for a bit.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted opinions on what I'm doing.\nTL;DR:"}

We hit it off very well. She and I had a lot in common, and we would spend a lot of time together. When she brought me around her friends, however, I didn't click well right off the bat(thank you, social anxiety). \n\nOne night, she cried her eyes out over her two best friends (of ~6 years) \"getting over their me phase\". One of her friends (also her roommate) stayed at her live-in boyfriend's (~2 years) place, and her other best friend and her friends almost never made time for my ex.\n\nWhere things get interesting is that my ex is very into Friend 2. My ex always texted with Friend 2 (never knew what they talked about), but they didn't spend much time together. Her roommate presented a similar situation. Interestingly enough, however, those two were instrumental in planning my ex's twentieth birthday party, which was a surprise and was attended by everybody in the clique around her two friends.\n\nAs far as I know, she never hangs out with anybody in that group other than the two friends (once in a good while), and all signs point to an unbalanced friendship with Friends 1 and 2. Either:\n1. I'm just really salty, or\n2. She has no friends, or...\n\nAnother friend (not Friend 1 or Friend 2) claims that my ex once watched her change, so she's calling lesbianism. While Friend 2 is in most of my ex's profile pictures going back several years, I'm just not too sure. This third friend also mentioned my ex attending a drag show, but I still don't know.\n\nI guess what the point of all this is, should I (try to) be friends with her? We broke up over her emotional immaturity, and we haven't spoken since we broke up. No Contact just seemed like the way to go, but now I'm not so sure. Any and all input is welcome.\nTL;DR:"}

We talked that night and she said she would've told me she would've told me earlier (we hung out the night before), but was too scared. My usual method of trying to get over someone is to just cut all ties for a couple months, but with her, I can't do that. We're so close, we talk almost everyday, and we hang out a lot. But the problem with still maintaining contact with her is that it doesn't let me get over her. I know it's probably the hormones talking, but every time we talk, I just get reminded about how absolutely amazing she is. I'm wondering if anyone can offer any advice on how to get over her?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Fellow ladies of reddit, do you ever feel frustrated, or that your views are not considered fairly when they conflict with popular stereotypes and beliefs related to the perception of women and women's issues?\nPOST: It's incredibly disheartening for me when this happens, and I feel like it goes unnoticed, or unacknowledged for the most part. I'm not saying I'm always right, or express myself perfectly all the time, but I always **try** to understand where other people are coming from, and even more so when I am in a position when I am part of the group whose perspectives are more popularized by society. For example, and I know this might instantaneously make some people hate me based on the misconceptions of the label, but I consider myself a person that GENERALLY agrees with academic feminism. *However*, I put a sincere effort toward trying my best to communicate that I am sympathetic toward issues that effect men as well as those regarding women, and that I absolutely believe there are legitimate, unique difficulties men face, and that there are unfair expectations, and popular social practices that are disadvantageous to men, and should certainly be considered sexist and outdated (examples might include the idea that women and children's lives are more valuable than men's lives, or the unfair bias in favor of women in custody battles). \n\nAll I want is to be shown the same consideration I try to afford when I am in the position of power, so to speak. We can argue all day over whether or not, and to what extent that men have power and privilege in our society, but you cannot argue that there isn't a discrepancy of female perspective on a website that simply has less female members. It is not because I think men on reddit intentionally want their perspectives to dominate, or don't want to sympathize women's issues, but only the result of a disproportionately represented population. If reddit were made up of more women than men than the female perspective would probably overpower the male perspective, and there would be a bias in favor of women's perspectives. Men of reddit cannot control the fact that they outnumber women, and should not generally be blamed for this bias. I am only hoping that they acknowledge that it exists, and act accordingly. \n\nI know this won't be well received, but whatever.\nTL;DR:"}

We have the opportunity to move to North Carolina with my GF's Dad, and live/work at his private airport. Her dad loves me, and the 3 of us get along extremely well and have a good time together. He brought the idea up to us a year ago but we weren't ready then. We've talked to him recently and he said he is ready for us anytime. I feel like my family got to spend a lot of time with me and my GF over the past few years, and now he deserves some time with us (this isn't a huge reason, just a plus). We love the outdoors, and could backpack and hike all over NC. We could work at the airport and help her dad, no more shit 8-5 retail jobs. Basically we are ready for a change, and this is an opportunity. that we don't want to pass up. We don't think it would be permanent, but we don't know if we'd move back to my home state. \n\nI'm 24 years old, I'm financially stable, and am ready to do my own thing and live my life.  I understand my parents worries and fears, but I want to make it clear to them that this is what I want to do, and that in the end it will be ok.\n\nSorry this is so long-winded, I just felt there were lots of necessary details.

She doesn't seem to have much connection to the real world and how it works, and I'm honestly worried that she's losing touch (or has long lost touch) with reality. I'm quite convinced that she's a sociopath. She regularly uses people to get what she wants and to get things done, without any regard for how it affects the people she's using. She is a recluse and has no friends. She is incredibly self-centered and only views the world with respect to how it affects her. She is the very definition of manipulative and is a pathological liar. Her emotional reactions to things do not seem genuine, and when she tries to relate to other people's emotions, her assessment of them is always greatly exaggerated, as if she can't quite grasp the magnitude of a person's emotions. She has no sense of remorse, shame or guilt, and she blames everyone else for her mistakes. She is the single most irresponsible person i have ever known.  \n\nOn top of this, I'm also quite sure she's a prescription drug addict. She has always been the type of person to immediately seek a pill cure for any ailment, and she's got so many medications (at last count around 25) that when she visits family she transports them in a multi-level, fold out tackle box. There are certainly some medications that she really needs, like thyroid medication and some for chronic nerve pain, but there are also many she probably doesn't.

But, on the other hand, if I wait too long it may unfortunately be too late.\n\nAdvice on how to proceed would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Might be moving in together soon\nPOST: So we've been going out nearly 3 years. We get on really well. Going to be brutally honest and say I never found her 'hot', but we got on really well. We never fight, and she is always so nice to me. Would definitely be marriage material. \n\nAll i worry is that there is no 'spark'. There never has really been, but we've got on so well I have never worried about it. I have had it before with girls. Because its getting to move in together time ( roommates annoying, house is not great ) and I generally would like a change, it makes me wonder about the relationship. I travelled for a month on my own and really liked the independence. She didn't like me being away. I have been the needy one before, so i know what its like. \n\nI did voice some concerns, and said to her i was unhappy, but i wasnt sure what was making me unhappy. ( Still dont know ). So she let me go on this month away, which i loved. I still find other girls really attractive, and sometimes wonder if i was single. Cognisant of greener grass etc.\n\nI know could seperate and see, but we have had two very good years, so don't want to throw that away nonchalantly either. What should I be thinking about?

Sorry for any bad formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\nSome background information on our situation; Me and my SO are part of a group of people that essentially revolves around gaming, this post only refers to some people, not everyone in the group. We have been regular members of this group for little under a year and have grown quite close to most of the members.\n\nThe problems started about a month ago when the people we classed as good friends and people we were close to started treating us differently and excluding us from various activities and opportunities, for example they would play games online together and leave us out and not ask us to join or name calling and harsh comments aimed at my partner because he is better at some games than our friends. Also I don't feel as if they include me as my own person, but more as an extension to my SO and not a real member. I have experienced this from our friends asking if my SO will be attending events and not me, or saying that it's a shame that my SO won't be attending and not considering that I could attend on my own. \n\nThe way we are being treated is really getting us down and I find it really frustrating and we are not sure how best to react to it. Really I am looking for advice on whether we should confront them on what has been happening, or just cut them out of our lives and move on without saying anything to them.\nIf we confront them there's a possibility that it could escalate into an argument or something but would mean I get to rant about what they have been doing and get it off my chest, but in reality just cutting them out and moving on might be best. Either way we will have to on might have to give a reason to our reaction and I have no idea on how to express this.\nAny advice would be really appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

She is a great person, is pretty, has similar life goals and aspirations, and similar values. \nThe trouble is I've always thought of myself as more of a non traditional kind of guy. I legitimately have qualms with the institution of marriage, the enshrinement of monogamy, and a super vanilla sex life. I don't know if I'm talking about getting married because it's the expected thing for me to do, because I've grown incredibly attached to her and don't want to lose her, or if I'm just resigning my rebel card for something dependable. \nShe is a great girl, a fantastic cook, fun to be around, pretty, and extremely friendly. She's also unhealthy in her eating and exercise habits (which is partially due to medical issues), isn't in the same place as me career or interest wise, and is boring in bed. I do love her a great deal, but don't know of this is what I should be doing. \nI also could just be nitpicking about what is by all counts the best relationship I've ever had with a good woman who loves me.\nTL;DR:"}

We're in an incredibly happy and loving relationship, we've lived together for over a year and things are good. However the one problem we have is the dishes. \n\nDespite the rest of the apartment being pretty clean all the time, as we both clean it, there is often a pile of unwashed dishes in the sink as neither of us really want to do them, just frequently ask the other to do it until (usually) I give in and do them in the middle of the night for the sake of cleanliness.\n\nWhat it really seems to boil down to (no pun intended), is the fact that she loves to cook. I entirely understand the idea that if one person cooks, the other should do the dishes, and often I have no problem with it. However, I'd rather we heat up frozen food or put together sandwiches or something more often than not. She also seems to need to use more than a dishwasher's load of dishes every time she cooks a meal. This leaves me in the position where she feels that I should do two loads of dishes a day because she cooked, even though I've expressed to her that often I'd rather just make a frozen pizza. \n\nCurious about your opinions of how to handle this minor problem.\nTL;DR:"}

The next day they were supposed to talk and he showed up a bit early and I was still there and she got severely angry and asked for her key to her place back. He had \"car trouble\" and no ride home. She eventually drove him home despite being so angry with him. I waited at her place until she returned. Anyways, I'm fairly certain she still talks with him on and off. I also think she has been meeting with his family to talk as well. He has since gave her some gifts which she keeps and displays (more flowers and a picture).\n\nI asked her to be exclusive and she told me she wasn't ready for that. They continue to hang out about once a week go for coffee or what ever. And he STILL has a key to her apartment and while she was away on a conference got him to check in on the place and feed the animals. I get her attention on the weekends and he seems to get it once a week during the week. She doesn't tell me everything and I don't think she has told her mother about any of these meeting with her ex. Her mom I take it doesn't like her seeing him and she wants to avoid questioning...\n\nmost of this information hasn't been forthwith and I've kinda pieced it together.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Texas landlord entered without notice, i was served eviction notice as a result. Where does the law stand?\nPOST: My landlord entered my apartment in may. They gave us written notice that we needed to clean up the place some more, and that they would come back for an inspection in a couple days. Obviously, a few days later they came and did another inspection, found nothing amiss, so they verbally told us they would be coming in to inspect it once every couple of weeks. Our lease says that any inspections must be notified in writing ahead of time, or they must leave notice inside upon leaving the apartment. I suspect they have been coming in unannounced but have no proof of this. However, on October 3rd, they placed an eviction notice on a loose sheet of paper on the outside of my door stating my apartment was unsanitary. They could not have known it was unsanitary unless they came in to  my home while I was away, at which point they should have left a notice in plain sight. I have received no such notice except for the one in may and the eviction which did not say they had entered in any way, shape, or form. My cosigner never was given a lease to sign, and I was only given a copy of my original lease. The lease also states that they must deliver any eviction by hand to a resident, by mail, or posting on the inside of the main door.\nTL;DR:"}

At one point, he was saying that the girls in the class don't like him. And she said \"well I hope I'm not standoff-ish, I would date you if not for my BF.\" (Not these exact words, but that was the jist of it).\n\nThat was the worst message, and she seemed to understand how that hurt me and she said she won't talk to him anymore. She told me she only saw him as a friend and that I had nothing to worry about, so I tried to get past it.\n\nSo time goes on and last month I found out they still talk, although not often.\n\nA recent conversation started about a TV show they watch, and my GF said a part \"reminded\" her of him, because the character meets a guy in Mexico, whilst having a BF, and feels guilty b/c she has feelings for this guy she meets in Mexico.\n\nNow the weird part is, that just a few weeks ago this guy ended up coming out as gay. (They haven't talked since he came out).

We mainly talked about what we want from each other. I told her that I want something more serious and stable. She said that she wants something less serious because she said that she does not have the time or the emotional capability to have something serious. I told her that I will slow down for her. She just seems like she has her mind made up. Though that may just be my crazy mind\n\nI really care about her and my friends make it obvious that I have more feelings for her than she does for me.

My boyfriend and I play league of legends together regularly and we both really love the game. He, however, is much better at this game, as well as practically any other game, than I. I've never really enjoyed playing any video/computer game. Until I was introduced to league, that is. I'm not very good and he knows this. When I first started playing I was awful. I played a lot and became better with his help but even at level 30, I play \"as if I am level 10\" (according to him). We really like playing with each other and not alone, but it seems like half the time we do play, we fight. I mess up, buy the wrong items, walk the wrong way, feed, don't use skills correctly, ect....   and he gets a little frustrated, which makes me really angry. I want to do well and to make him proud. But when I get angry in response to his being annoyed over how bad I am at the game, it starts a huge fight. I just feel hopeless whenever I dissapoint him in a game and I blow up in response. I tell him that I need him to remember that it's just a game all the time, and he does know that. But if we lose the game (which is a team game, and my badness really affects the whole team), he acts as if he's wasted an hour and I feel absolutely horrible. Other than this, we rarely have any large fights. What can I do to stop the fighting?\nTL;DR:"}

I am 26F, he is 27M; we have been together for 2.5 years, and became engaged in July.\n\nWhen I was away for the summer, my fiance, \"Matt,\" smoked some of my weed. He confessed, and I told him that it was okay, but that he should ask me before he took any more. However, two weeks ago, he secretly took the rest of my stash while packing for the bachelor party of his best friend, \"Luke.\" \n\nI was very disappointed when, upon returning the next day, Matt told me what he had done. It was insignificant materially, yet he did compromise my respect and trust. He said that he declined to ask my permission for fear that I'd say no. I responded honestly that I would have given it to him so long as he'd asked nicely. \n\nMatt was repentant. I forgave him, and insisted that he replace what he took as well as speak with Luke, who is wise and kind and whom Matt respects deeply. I want Matt to know that my forgiveness, while sincere, isn't cheap (I've made it so on other occasions). I also hoped that he would make himself accountable to someone else, as incidents that conspire between us alone are too dismissible. I haven't mentioned it to anyone until now.\n\nThis morning, I asked Matt whether he had followed up on these requests. He said that he'll meet someone tomorrow about the weed but bristled about talking with Luke. When I said that it's important to me, he said that it isn't my prerogative. So, is it fair to press the point, or should I let it go? I have no qualms about Matt himself: he is generous, intelligent, and loving. Further, and tellingly, he's often ready to sacrifice his wishes for mine. Either way, I want what's best for long-term mutual fairness and goodwill.\n\nThank you!\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know how to handle this.\nPOST: My wife and I have been together for almost 10 years, and married for 8. We've had our rough patches. About 6 months ago we had a huge fight and she moved back in with her parents. She lived with them for almost a month before we got back together.\n\nA few months ago I found out that while we were apart she had sex with some guy that hit on her while she was at the gym.\n\nThat really fucked with me because throughout our relationship I had told her that pretty much the only unforgivable thing she could do was have an affair. She broke down and told me how she was so pissed off at me that she thought we would never get back together.\n\nWe did reconcile with some caveats, but we're back together. \n\nShe came home from her appointment today and her eyes were red rimmed. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she's been diagnosed with cervical cancer. \n\nI looked up some stuff online and it looks like one of the more common methods of getting cervical cancer is if you have hpv. \n\nI can't prove that she got hpv from that guy, I guess it can be dormant for quite a while, and I can't prove that the hpv caused the cancer. But I have this sickening feeling in my stomach that this is all her fault, that if she hadn't had the affair she wouldn't have cancer now. \n\nI told my wife that I'm there for her 100%. I'd never tell her these feelings I'm having about it being her fault, she doesn't deserve that. I just don't know what to do. The cancer is still in its early stages, and they might be able to fully treat it with chemo and radiation without having to do surgery. I think we'll learn more next week on the follow up. \n\nIt's possible because of this she'll never be able to have kids and now I'm regretting waiting so long to try for them.

Last night i went out with someone i thought was a friend to a concert in chicago. we drank a LOT, and did some E for the show. While we were on our way i noticed he was being a little flirty with me but i thought it was just the alcohol and the drugs working so i thought nothing of it (I was very inebriated also and at that point i was having a pretty great time) when we get to the concert we're rolling hard and drunk as shit. He started to dance with me which again i thought nothing of since my guy friends dance with me all the time and my boyfriend never seemed to mind too much. But then my friend tried to kiss me...i told him promptly that i had a boyfriend which is something i guess he didn't know (this was a group of friends i had only recently made) As the night went on though he tried again and again until finally i let him. the rest of the night was sort of a blur but i let him kiss me multiple times, and when we got back to the dorm we kind of 'snuggled' together. Now i dont know what to do, i am i no way attracted to this guy but i really dont want to lose his friendship because he's a really nice person, I dont want to tell my boyfriend because it would hurt him too much and i dont want him to hate me/break up with me because im still madly in love with him. The only reason i let him kiss me was because: a) i was getting lonely being apart from my bf. b) the mixture of drugs alcohol and the club scene, and c) the fact that he liked me caught me off guard and i was very confused by the whole situation i had no idea how to handle it.\nwhat the fuck should i do???\nTL;DR:"}

This has led to me feeling so much resentment that I have a hard time being sweet towards him. We have been together for 4.5 years, and are getting married in 6 months. I know that I need to find a way to let go of resentment, and maybe better my communication of negative emotions before walking down the aisle. My question is how?  How do I tell my \"macho\" fiance that he should be doing most, not all, just most of the daily household chores as he is unemployed and I work 70+ hours a week? How do I explain that when I get off a 12 hour shift, come home to find the kitchen a mess, the bed unmaid, the litter box not cleaned, the floor dusty/fur covered, glasses and plates in various places throughout the house, the toilet covered in piss and shit, and a pile of dirty clothes sitting next to the basket that I have no desire to be a sweet little princess who fawns all over him for existing. That I feel that being a part time student isn't difficult enough to warrant me being the only one who works, cleans, plans the wedding, make weekend plans, and pays all the bills. Not to mention the fact that he expects me to cook for him on my days off, but if I don't than I get the dick version of him. And finally, I'm starting graduate school next week, I need him to do more to support me. How can I say these things without making him defensive, and not getting his dickish attitude?  Am I completely off for thinking he should be doing most of the house work?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: How many redditors like the practice of giving/receiving presents?\nPOST: Lately I've found myself disillusioned with the whole tradition of giving presents. We so often get things we don't want, which subsequently sit around collecting dust or get thrown/given away. I will only give people presents that I know will absolutely be appreciated and used. I don't really like receiving presents because I never get what I want, and then I just have more stuff. I'm one of these people who truly loves gift cards. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, but I'm trying to get rid of the useless stuff I have, not acquire more. With a gift card I can get exactly what I want (which is probably a kindle book or a functional item); a 'cute' knick knack is just going to get in the way. \n\nI did participate in the reddit secret santa, because I love connecting with people around the world. But it looks like my giver decided not to get me a present anyway. \n\nDo you guys like giving/getting presents? Anyone else love gift cards even though they're supposedly a bad gift?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love presents if they're done right. I just hate the common scene of getting a present you don't like, then having to pretend to like it, then having it sit around taking up space. Then I just feel guilty for being ungrateful. So I decided I would rather do away with the practice. Which is sad, because I am one of the best  gifters you'll ever meet.\nTL;DR:"}

I find out several months ago he's been having another relationship with an ex. And substance abuse problems. I'm devastated.\n\nHe cut contact with the ex, went to rehab, and I can honestly say I'm really glad that I gave him another chance. He has taken this so seriously, and really done so much to repair things. Our relationship is actually stronger than I could imagine, and I'm beginning to rebuild some of the trust. \n\nThe problem here is that I'm going this weekend to meet his family.

I'm just really nervous this is going to be awkward. I'm meeting his mom, aunts, uncles, cousins, the whole shebang. What am I supposed to say if someone in his family asks \"Oh, how long have you been together?\" I don't want to embarrass either of us any more than necessary.\n\n I want his family to like me. It's the nervousness of meeting your SO's family times 100. I don't want to be humiliated or made fun of. He assures me that everything will be okay. \n\nAny advice on how to handle this? I can't make light of the situation because it was very hurtful and I don't really want to laugh it off, but I don't want it to be this thing hanging over my head the entire trip either.

Between work/hobbies/friends/classes, he doesn't have much time for me. We maybe see each other 1-3 times a week, and when we're together, everything seems fine and wonderful. He's attentive, affectionate, etc. But when we're apart, I hardly hear from him. For instance, he hasn't contacted me at all 3 out of the past 6 days. \n\nTo add to this, he knows I struggle with depression and anxiety, and don't really have much of a social life apart from him (long story, but I've moved around a lot and don't know many people in my current location). I have absolutely no problems with him not being able to see me daily, as I'm an introvert myself and enjoy my alone time. However, I wonder if he ever even thinks about me when we're apart, as he so rarely checks in with me. My ex before him would at least send me a good night text or something if we hadn't spoken during the day, so maybe I'm just used to that.\n\nI understand the first thing to do would be talk to him about it, but I don't want to come across as needy and insecure (even though I am the latter!)\nTL;DR:"}

My feelings for him had gotten so strong I couldn't hold back any longer.\n\nI tried to talk to him about it before he left but instead he left without saying goodbye, which was extremely hurtful, and it caused me a lot more pain than I had ever imagined.

I've never felt so strongly about someone before and I thought I would be over it by now, but I still miss him and find myself thinking about him a lot.\n\nWe haven't talked or interacted at all in a year now. No likes on Facebook, no Snapchats, Tweets... nothing. \n\nHe's living overseas and I have been thinking about sending him an email to see how he's doing - a very casual email, and I'm very conflicted as to whether or not I should send it. \n\nI don't understand why I can't let it go. It seems to go in cycles, where I miss him a lot, then I don't. I've tried everything...

People have much longer commutes and are doing just fine (30-40 minutes is not that long of a commute).\n\nI mean, I'll compromise if I only put 780 dollars toward rent but he says that's unfair.

I decided to try to get off by discreetly fapping in the open. I went to my high school at around 7pm, so there was nobody present. I located one of the lunch tables where certain girls ate their food, and started furiously pounding my meat. I eventually shot a monstrous load on the table, which was about 4 inches by 2 inches. Then, I pull up my pants and look behind the slime scene, and what do I see? The janitor in the distance, about 80 feet away, emptying a trash can. I could tell by his expression that he had seen shit. I show up the next day, and they had quarantined the entire table with yellow tape. Apparently, they were going to do a deep cleaning of the area, because it was a health hazard. I thought that was the worst that could happen, but later that day, my name is called on the intercom, and they usher me to the vice principal. The janitor was able to ID me! The vice principal talks to me for a half hour saying how what I did was horrible and unsanitary, and a violation of basic policies. When I came back to class, it was obvious that a lot of people knew what I did. When I came home, my parents had got the call, and from what they heard, I urinated on the table, rather than ejaculated. I thought that was about the best stroke of luck I had that gotten since the incident, but then they started accusing me of drinking beer, talking about how there was a case missing from the fridge. I had no idea about any of that, but I just agreed to save myself from further embarrassment. So as of today, I am alienated from everybody at my school, and have lost the trust of my parents.

I'm not sure if I can just let it go. It's really distracting me from everything I do and I feel if I message her again it'll just seem annoying/desperate of me.

Unfortunately, I am a lot like the stereotypical reddit guy, in that I am kind of awkward, somewhat overweight, and spend all of my free time either playing video games, or on reddit.\nSince I haven't had a job for a long time, basically whenever I haven't been applying/interviewing for jobs, I've been sitting around my apartment by myself (I don't have a gf, and my friends are of course working all day, and I don't have much money to spend doing things).

Luckily I got hired at a pretty good company (I work in real estate) and Monday was my first day at my new job. Since it was my first day on the job, I didn't have much to do (they mostly had me watch training videos on the various software the company uses), and I let my mind wander into my own little world.

Everyone stared at me, and I heard one woman say, \"oh my god.\" There's really no good explanation for what happened, so I spent the rest of the week trying to act normal and pretend it never happened.

And, then, I added that it should be healthy to see people and be alone some times. I think, at first, he felt kind of down about this. But, I assured him that it had nothing to do with him. It just has to do with my own personality, that I need to be apart sometimes to maintain a healthy attitude. \n\nA part of me doesn't want this though, because I do want to be with him all the time.

A girl who he knows, my boyfriend is acquainted with and whom I have heard of has been talking to our friend. They were texting innocently and she randomly sent him completely nude pictures of herself with no prompting on his part(according to other people we know she sends lots of guys pictures like these). I think it was the day after our friend told us about the pictures my bf initiated conversation with this girl on fb. I didn't even know that he knew her.

Not because I think he's likely to do anything; but because she's crossing lines.\n\nShe got drunk the other night and messaged him (multiple times in a row) and he showed me the messages. It set off alarm bells, because she was at a music festival, with friends; and she took time out to message him about very mundane things and to tell him how cool she thinks he is. In  fact, she spent every night that she was supposed to be at the music festival; messaging him. \n\nI mentioned to him after that, that my intuition is telling me that she is flirting with him; and he was like 'nah, we went on one date at the start of our friendship, and there wasn't anything there.' So I left it alone. \n\nI don't want to be that girlfriend who tells her partner who he can hang out with. That's not my job and I have been on the receiving end of that kinda thing in the past so I know it's shit. Having said that, I don't know what to do. She makes me uncomfortable and insecure; not in the relationship or in him, but in myself. \nWhat should I do.\nTL;DR:"}

Now this situation happens a lot but today, I had no patience. I got my clothes on, told him that he should leave (he needed to go anyway) and gave him the cold shoulder. I don't know what it was, but something struck inside me and I just felt disappointed and I swear I'm feeling something else but I can't put my finger on it. I have done something like this before for the same reason, but not this bad. \n\nI crave sex, despite orgasming very rarely and not feeling much throughout. It was something I was never really interested in before, it was something I was usually forced into by my ex's, I rarely wanted it with them. I guess that was my purpose to them and I fear maybe that part of my past is coming through and making me crave sex, to feel validated/important almost. When I can't have sex with him, I don't know if I'm disappointed in him or myself or just impatient. I have no idea. \n\nWhen we can't have sex, part of me thinks back to my past, questioning why I want sex so much, another makes me feel like I'm not sexy enough for him so that's why he can't get up or I think he's not trying hard enough to try and find a way to improve both our sex lives. \n\nI want to apologise too and I usually do for such things but part of me feels like my bitchiness was validated. I only ever apologise if there's no reason behind it, but I feel like there is in this situation. He said he was really shocked and had seen another side to me which made me see how bad I was and he's probably going to feel shit about it. \n\nI'm hoping someone could give me some idea as to what's causing a problem here and how to resolve it.\nTL;DR:"}

My friend found my boyfriends dating profile. If anyone is familiar with POF, they have a function called \"Meet Me\" where you can scroll through photos of people and click yes or no if you want to meet them. WELL, my boyfriend clicked YES to my friends profile. To think he would actually be that stupid or maybe he actually wanted to get caught crossed my mind.\n\nI am a bit confused though as to the description on his profile. He made himself 2 years younger, living in the town he first lived in when he moved to my state, and used two old photos. The third one is questionable of when it was taken, not sure if it was recent or not. Now, we met on this website one year ago and the username was different but everything else was exactly the same as it was when I met him. This is a different username now (not that it means anything) and I am hoping it isn't him but it's too much of a coincidence. He changed his birthday and his eye color which was weird to me.\n\nI am going to confront him but my friend is trying to help me out and created a fake profile to message him on, using a mutual friends photos. She thinks it could be a catfish but I'm not sure. The photos on his profile disappeared this afternoon, but I haven't said a word about it to my boyfriend.\n\nI'm not looking for advice on how to stay with him. I don't plan to if it is actually his profile. Even if he hasn't cheated, it is his intent. I'm asking for advice on how to break up with him. I screenshotted his profile and saved all the information before he deleted his photos so there is no way he can deny it isn't him. Do I even owe him an opportunity to explain? I thought of different ways, such as creating a fake profile, setting up a date with fake person and instead of \"her\" showing up, it's me. Or just sending him all my screenshots and break up with him that way.\n\nI am sad over this. I truly hope it isn't his but evidence isn't in his favor here.\nTL;DR:"}

It tried to Evangelion, which was great, but it failed because there wasn't enough action. No, that's not true. I dislike it because it comes off as pretentious. Every character is a perfect Mary Sue who gets fucked unjustly, and the series falls into every trope it attempts to avoid.\n\nThere's too much negative space in the plot. There was a combined full episode of tense dialogue across the whole show. I felt myself getting angry at Kaname, the main character, for all the wrong reasons. You were supposed to hate Shinji because he was the worst parts of you. You hate Kaname because she's the generic white bitch in a horror movie. It feels like there are a lot of arguing plots going on. The main threat is the Unteralterbacht, or maybe it's Coobie, or maybe it's Homura? None of these are resolved in the end. Kaname supposedly saves the day in the end, except that she very obviously fucks everyone over in the end just as bad as they had been before. If the plot of the movie is about Homura fixing everything and killing Madoka, then that is resolution.\n\nMadoka spends so much time foreshadowing that you already know how it ends by episode 4. That doesn't build tension. You keep expecting a plot twist but nothing happens. It's just the same magical girl show you've seen before, but with a black coat of paint. There's not enough action considering the amount of tense dialogue, and I feel like Kaname is making everyone say the same thing over and over again.\n\nThe only subplots that engaged me were Homura' and Sayakka's.

Then I beat myself up the rest of the day and usually end up eating even worse things through guilt.\n\nOr say, lunch time rolls around and I'm really *not* hungry (big breakfast, or just not a lot of activity today). I could not eat, and I wouldn't really feel all that bad, and hey, that's great, right? But no, its lunchtime (or dinner time, or breakfast time, or any other \"normal\" eating time) so I HAVE to eat. My brain just won't let me get on with my day until I put something in my face, especially if someone asks \"Hey!! You want to come to lunch with us?\" (which always ends up being something I shouldn't eat, as well.) Basically, I don't want to be \"that girl that only ever eats salad, LOL\" if I'm out with friends, and I can't go to a restaurant with people and *not* eat without feeling super weird and guilty. \n\nEven getting home and eating dinner with my husband results in me finishing whatever we cooked (even if its a lot more than I should eat) because it will just get thrown away otherwise, and that's a waste. Similar problem - if I'm not hungry for dinner, I will *still eat it because its there.\nTL;DR:"}

Spent some time with some old friends from high school, reconnected with, at the time, (20/F) friend. I expressed interest in dating her, she kind of beat around the bush for a few days, figured she wasn't interested but didn't want to hurt my feelings, so I said hey, no big deal, and hit the road.\n\nStarted university, met a great (19/F), dated for about a year, moved in together towards the end. I was forced to leave the university and go back to my hometown after getting laid off and running out of funding. When I left we decided that it would be best to split up, and reconvene in a few years to decide our fate after I dealt with the financial stuff and could get back to the uni. It was foggy though since we still said I love yous and what not. \n\nBack home, started martial arts again, found a job almost instantly, things going great, started hanging out with old friend again only to discover that she really did want to date, but didn't know what to do since she hadn't seriously dated anyone before. We went on a few simple platonic dates and I decided it was worth another shot. I get a message today from the ex saying \"Please whatever you do, don't date or do anything sexual with (friend).\" \nFollowed by the usual, can you visit soon, and so on. \n\nI'm not really sure what to do here. When we split, we made it clear to each other that dating other people was okay, it was an actual breakup. I'm not sure why she would single out this one person in particular. I really like this girl, but I would feel wrong dating someone when I still say \"I love you\" to an ex. Am I scummy, or just ignorant?\nTL;DR:"}

I asked her, directly, if she ever felt bad after sex, if she ever felt upset and unhappy. She sighed, and said that she still felt guilt and unhappiness the day following an evening with me.

I am considering pursuing a relationship with her, but am worried about how to approach this.

I would also always be comparing her to her sister, who I was attracted to.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Any tips on curbing serious fear/defensive aggression towards strangers?\nPOST: Hey r/dogtraining I'm dealing with a pretty bad issue with my 2yo 55lb Pit/Lab mix Casey and wondering if any of you has experienced the same problem.\n\nA little background: When I adopted the dog (at about 1yo) I noticed he was playful and rowdy with other dogs, but very cautious and worried around people. He was very shy, but sweet with my girlfriend and I so I decided to adopt him. During the first 6-7mo I had him I tried to socialize him as much as possible by taking him to dog parks, friends BBQs, etc. He was also pretty easy to train commands like sit, down, stay, etc and tends to listen to me well. He was always shy and cautious around strangers, but it was never a problem until recently.\n\nNow whenever we have strangers over to the house it's recently escalated to snapping, growling, barking, and nipping. This seems to happen mostly with movement (stranger walks forward, reaches/leans for something, or moves an object). Most recently, there was an incident where he nipped a guest fairly hard a drew a spot of blood. Needless to say after that, and the new behavior he's exhibiting, I don't allow him around strangers anymore unless he's on a leash and it's scary/embarrassing when we have people over to the house. He's also very unpredictable in that he's totally fine with some people (and generally ok with most strangers outside of his environment). He can go from wagging his tail to snapping within a split second. I think much of this could be related to him not being properly socialized with people during his first year as a puppy, or perhaps he's trying to protect us from strangers he deems as threats?\n\nI'm having a professional trainer come over in a couple weeks to address the situation and in the meantime keeping him separated from strangers for safety concerns. I'm just wondering if any of you have experienced this - I've been reading a lot of stuff online, but everyone seems to have a different technique and this is a pretty complex behavioral issue that's a bit over my head.\nTL;DR:"}

She tells me where and that's about 5 miles from my house but I'm willing to ride my bike to where she is to make sure she doesn't get hurt or hurt anyone else driving drunk. She asks to come to my house for the night and I tell her yes but wait til I get to her so I can drive her there. While I'm talking on the phone, my other female friend who was staying at my place for the night asks what's going on and I guess my bestfriend hears her and she suddenly starts telling me she's sorry for disturbing me and that's she will just go home by herself but I tell her to not be like this right now because she's been drinking and not thinking straight but she hangs up. So I'm in a panic and I call the police to tell them that my friend is driving drunk and want them to try and get to her before she hurts herself or someone else so I give them her Info, my info and where her last known location was and dispach is sent the message I guess. She texts me shortly after and I tell her what I did and she gets upset but I told her its was for her safety and that it didn't matter if she lost her license and I didn't want her to get hurt drunk driving. Now I feel like I did something wrong when I wanted to make sure she was safe. Did I do the right thing?\nTL;DR:"}

We have a an extremely open communication, we read each other like open books and usually only need half a word to understand each other. This leads to only one problem: how am I ever going to keep a secret from him?\n\nHis birthday is in November and I've arranged a small yet very personal surprise. Something about us, about one of our best moments together, something funny. Problem is, I can't hide anything from him! I act suspicious when I buy him a T-shirt or gift him something on Steam and he usually guesses it right away. He mentioned something about a necklace he wants last week and I've been awkward about it every time he mentions is, very obviously spoiling the fact that I have been looking for that necklace for sale ever since he mentioned it. So now I ordered something for his birthday (not that necklace, although I might start pretending it is...) which is in November... how am I going to hide this little surprise from him?\nTL;DR:"}

We are each other's firsts, but we've dated before each other, just not sex. Anyways, she mentioned the other day how she thinks we should, at some point in time, try sleeping with other people before we got married so that 1) we didn't sleep with only one person our whole lives and 2) we are sure what we have is special compared to sleeping with someone else. She said she doesn't want to resent me in the future for something that she can't control right now because someone she knows is still dating her high school boyfriend who was her first and only and now hates her boyfriend. So my girlfriend doesn't want this to happen to us. She doesn't want this anytime soon, I even asked if she wanted to next summer and she said that was probably too soon IF we ever did it. We are both very sexual people, we have sex at least once a day, most of the time more than that. She is amazing and caring and we have an awesome relationship. I have always wanted a threeway like most other guys, but she does not want that. She wants a completely separate night with different people, like a couple swap. I've done research and it says not to couple swap to fix a relationship, but ours isn't in need of fixing, everything is totally fine. This happens to be a sexual fantasy of mine, but the kind that I don't know if I would actually ever go through with. So what should I do? Tell her no and risk her being unhappy and possibly leaving in the future? Or go through with it and deal with the possible consequences? Or something else?\nTL;DR:"}

Then I took it a little deeper from 1ft-3ft took a photo then all of a sudden my phone is all black. Immediately I feel that the phone is suffering water damage because I had fully charged it prior to coming to work. Obviously I made sure that the sides were all sealed up and the headphone jack is fine even though it is opened before I went in. Still water had seeped through and my phone was gone. As I arrive home I think to myself \"It can't be that hard to fix a water damaged phone I could probably do it myself\". Worst mistake ever...not only do I know nothing about phone hardware but I didn't even have the proper tools to remove everything. As I start prying off the back the glass shatters, knowing that everything is fucked I just searched up if I could purchase a new backing after I am done with everything. I found one online for super cheap so then I say alright let's do this! I start shattering all the glass until I finally get all the backing off. This is where I really fuck up, after ten minutes of shattering my phone I released minuscule shattered glass everywhere that is small enough to inhale. I immediately grab a face mask and vacuum then get straight to vacuuming. I started with the desk and just to add the cherry on top of everything I suck up some of the pieces I need to put my phone back together.\nTL;DR:"}

Be wary of Yatra and Travelguru.\nPOST: I am planning to visit Chennai next year and need a hotel near the airport in mid-June. While searching the various booking sites I found a great price on  for a single at the Westin Velachery of 3230 INR including taxes, about half the price shown on other major booking sites or the hotel site. I also found the same price on  Further searches found the booking agencies are Indian, have been around for years, and seemed legitimate. \n\nI decided to book on Travelguru. After going through the usual process, I reached the payment page. I inserted details of my card and reached the visa verification page. After a delay it returned me to the visa detail page with an alert that my card 'may be invalid'.  I re-inserted the details and tried again and went through the same process. To cut a long story short I skyped the company and, after periods on hold, disconnected calls and mounting frustration eventually reached a person who advised me that only credit cards based on Indian banks are accepted. He also told me that it was too early for June 2016 but could not explain why the prices for all rooms for that date were on the system.\n\nBeing a sucker for punishment I tried the same process on Yatra. Instead of looping at the visa stage  the 'do not refresh while we accept your payment' page froze until I gave up and cleared it.  \n\nThe good news is that my cc account shows no charges were made. I have since discovered Yatra owns Travelguru.\nTL;DR:"}

I love her and care about her very much, but I'm starting to worry about a few things.\n\nI'll start off by saying that she hasn't had the easiest life. Her parents separated when she was pretty young, which resulted in her mom actually leaving the country. This left her with her dad, who at times can be a great guy, but ultimately is one hell of a mess. He hasn't had a job in years, and basically leeches to get by, sometimes even leeching off his own daughter (my girlfriend). She has a part time job, goes to school, and has to worry about her father. In addition to all of this, a lot of shitty things have been happening to her (she's been feeling sick and is having back problems, her best friend recently moved away, and her cat that she has had for like 18 years just died)\n\nBottom line is, she's been really sad and stressed the fuck out lately, which is stressing me out. I feel horrible about it and I try my best to console her and comfort her through it, but it just seems like there's nothing I can say to her to cheer her up. Meanwhile, she hasn't been in the mood for sexy times at all. I completely understand why, but it's all just very frustrating. I had previously mentioned that we've broken up twice before, mainly because I wasn't prepared to handle all of the stress that came along with this relationship; this time, however I want to try my best to take it on and help her through it. I just need a little advice on going about that\n\nI miss my fun, happy, sexy girlfriend, and I just want everything to bounce back. Is there anything I can say or do for her to bring her out of this funk she's been in, or is it just a matter of time/of her collecting herself?\nTL;DR:"}

Was wondering if anyone had some advice on how to make her transition here smooth?  \n\nA little back story. We got our boy at two months in our duplex knowing we were purchasing a house in the coming months. We crate trained him which was hell. He hated it. It took months before he finally got used to it and we could leave him in there without him crying for hours. It broke our hearts but we knew it was the safest thing for him while we were at work. Fast forward a couple months and we now have our house with a big yard. Took the first week off at the new place so he wasn't in his crate since we were home. Monday comes and we put him in and he freaks out to the point I had to come home. (I have cameras I can view remotely). Anyway, we decide to block off the new couches and leave him to roam. He takes to it perfectly. Doesn't chew anything, doesn't pee in the house, just finds a spot and sleeps. A couple weeks later we stop blocking the couches and he doesn't touch them.  Awesome!  All is good. \n\nThe female we have coming is house broken and crate trained. I don't think it's a good idea to leave her to roam the house when they are gone especially because this is new for everyone. Should I keep her crated in a separate room while we're gone?  I'm not putting our boy back in a crate just because the female is, for now. He earned his house roaming privileges. The goal is to have her crate free as well. \n\nAny advice?

(I didn't feel that getting married and still living in my mother's basement was something I wanted, or else I would have asked a long time ago, if any of you are thinking \"What took so long?\")\n\nI'm looking to pull away from the 'tradition' ways of doing it, putting ring in food, going to a nice place and just asking, etc. While those will get the job done, they don't reflect her personality.\n\nShe's not a girly-girl at all, and has a quirky sense of everything, especially her clothing. I don't think I've seen her wear matching socks, ever. She's also a Special Ed educator that has taught mostly with autistic and M.R. children. I've thought about getting the kids in her class to help me out with something unique, but some of the children are on the high end of the spectrum and can't function without help, and I wouldn't want to neglect any child from helping me. I still haven't fully ruled this out though.\n\nShe also has a thing for Taco Bell's mild sauce...she puts it on everything. I know some of those packets say on the front of them \"Will you marry me?\", and I thought I might be able to incorporate that somehow.\n\nShe's also loves Tetris. Freaking LOVES it. But besides that, isn't into video games at all :( .\nTL;DR:"}

I thought, \"no, this won't do anymore. This won't do *at all.*\" And let me tell you, I have Reddit to thank for this. \n\nI was scared to face myself and how I was treating my body, but one day I decided to change all my Reddit subscriptions to only positive, healthy ones. I unsubscribed from r/funny, r/adviceanimals, r/wtf, r/f7u12, r/gifs, r/videos, and all those other subreddits essentially dedicated to wasting time. Then I piled on the subscriptions to r/loseit, r/keto, r/fitness, r/c25k, r/getmotivated, and other communities dedicated to health, weight loss, and self-improvement. I figured if I was browsing reddit all the time, I might as well use it for good rather than evil. And so it began. \n\nMy actual weight loss has come almost entirely from dieting. I have been running (completed c25k in November and have been running somewhat regularly since), but I would not call myself a runner or anything. I'd still like to lose 15-20 more lbs and I plan to begin lifting weights soon, but I wanted to share my progress so far with this great community. Thanks Reddit!\nTL;DR:"}

One of these was \"the first number [he] ever got from a girl\" (his first \"serious\" relationship too at 15, the girl he lost his virginity to, and who cheated on him*) on a post it note.

Life isn't a romance novel though, and you don't get closure on things like this.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, I'm having some serious issues and I need advice.\nPOST: Okay reddit, I'm having serious problems, like the title says. It all started 2 days ago, on the way back from a trip to pensacola with the family, we stopped for food at Burger King. My grandfather and I entered the restaurant first to buy food for everyone, then my brother came in 5 minutes later with $40. My mom had given him the money to pay for everyone's food. My grandfather took $20 of that and paid for everything with his senior citizens discount. My brother put the other $20 in his pocket. Later, when confronted about this and said he didn't have the money. When asked again, he said that he took it but then lost it. Yesterday, my brother was running errands for my mother. Then after the last errand was ran, my mother said to him \"I appreciate you helping me with today, so I'm not going to say anything about the money. But just don't do it again, okay?\" Then there was silence... My mom called his name again, then he snapped. He came upstairs and started throwing things. He completely trashed my living room, broke paintings, furniture, the 65in hdtv, walls, etc... And while he was throwing furniture, some of the glass bounced back and cut my mom's forhead. I came downstairs and my mom was bleeding, I was going to murder this man (not really, I was just going to fight him) but my mom told me to just leave. So I ran to my friends house so we could jump him (I know this seems cheap but my brother is a pretty big guy with CRAZY reach... & he was enraged.) But he wasn't home. I ran back to my house and my brother was gone. My mom wiped the blood off her head, she was fine. I wish I took pictures of the wreck, but there has been alot of damage done. \n\nOn top of that, I was supposed to go to summer school, and summer school is $400. I don't think my mom will be able to afford fixing the house and send me to summer school so that means I'm probably going to fail the 11th grade. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Anyway, this happened back in middle school (around 2005). \n\nGrowing up, I was the outcast in my group of classmates from elementary school, and every time I almost made a friend, I would screw it up by being an annoying asshole. One day, I annoyed one of my more nerdier classmates, which cumulated into a fight of words. We both got in trouble, and were sent to the assistant principal's office. After begging her not to call my parents and begging my classmate for forgiveness, we were sentenced to in class suspension (basically in school suspension in another class of the same grade). While in class, I also tattled on the same student for playing on his Game Bot Advance, and the teacher told me not to be a tattle tale, even though it was against the rules.\n\nI still regret that day, and it is one of reasons I tend to stay quiet when things happen. I didn't even tell my mom about the suspension until years later.\nTL;DR:"}

His jealousy flared up, he became clingy and irrational... I felt like a babysitter because he would work himself up into a panic attack any time he thought I would break up with him.\n\nHe is also not in a place typical of a nearly 30 year old man. He moved back home, works a crappy job, and did not finish school. He was perfectly content with his lifestyle until I came along.\n\nThe combination of his behavior and lifestyle forced me to give him an ultimatum.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [17F] mother [40sF] doesn't let me close my door. How can I tell her I value my privacy?\nPOST: I'll start this off by saying the reason she *used* to have for keeping my door open was that I couldn't hear her when she called me. But the actual reason I couldn't hear her was because I was listening to loud music. I have since stopped listening to music during the hours she's likely to call me (i.e. dinner time, when she first comes home) and if I do, I'll let her know in advance and keep the volume to a minimum. She no longer has a reason to keep my door open because of this, but she manages to come up with stuff like \"if we get broken into, you wouldn't even know\", which I think is extremely farfetched.      \n\nHowever, she still doesn't let me close my door. She'll even make an effort to yell at me if she comes upstairs and sees it closed. Personally, I really value the privacy and solitude that my bedroom gives me, and it's the only place I can get it (and I doubt any of my family members want to see me changing or jamming out to a song that's been on repeat all day). Additionally, I can be a complete slob and my room can get really disgusting and I don't need anyone, especially my mom, seeing it before I get around to cleaning it up. And anyway, the idea of anyone being able to look into my room at anytime is unsettling to me. The issue has gotten so bad that my mom will instantly know when my door closes (there's a quiet, but audible *\"click\"*) and I've gotten into the habit of closing it in a way she won't hear.      \n\nIs there any way I can give my mom my perspective of the issue without \"speaking with that tone\"? Boundaries aren't really a thing in my family. Anyone could just walk in to my room at anytime without knocking, or go into my room when I'm not home and take/use my stuff. I've been trying to respect other people's privacy by initiating knocking and such but it seems to be going unnoticed.\nTL;DR:"}

Doing tasks earns coins and XP which you can use for the rewards and to update your avatar. For example I've listed junk/fast food under habits... if I eat it I take away a point, if I don't I add a point. Under dailies I have \"do squats\" which is for a squatting program I've been using every day. If I complete it, I check it off the list.\n\nFor me, it's a daily reminder to do the things that I know are healthy and will help me lose weight, rather than just logging on LoseIt. It's also a way of integrating my health goals with my daily work/life goals so that I feel like my to-do list and tasks are more holistic and representative of **all** my goals... not just weight loss, and not just work or professional.\n\nI thought I'd share in case anyone is looking for a new way to revamp their weight loss, set goals for improving their health, or make/break habits!\nTL;DR:"}

Almost always the moms who would come in looking for things would bring in their kids. Now, the kids are not usually annoying, and they were usually between the ages of 9-12. If they were causing trouble I would usually just have to tell them to stop, and it would work out fine.

Instead of just telling his mom what was going on, I wanted to have some fun because it had been a slow day. \n\nWhen they finally come to pay for their things I look the kid straight in the eyes, (He was obviously a boy, but he had hair that was longer than the usual where I live) And I say, \"What a lovely daughter you have there!\" It was like I had taken his \"cool, edgy attitude\" and smashed it with a sledgehammer. His face went from pale, straight to blood-red. His mom sees how embarrassed he is, finishes paying extremely quickly, and leaves without a word. I was so damn proud.\nTL;DR:"}

I am less so but often vehemently disagree with her views (I am being intentionally vague on our stances because it is irrelevant to the story). We have gotten into multiple fights over politics and typically attempt, for the sake of our friendship, avoid the topic and we are usually pretty successful. \n\nNow onto last night. Heather and her mother (whom I have never met) invited me out to dinner. I intentionally wanted to keep the topic off of politics not only for obvious reasons but because I figured if Heather was politically charged, her mother would be the same or more so (regardless I didnt want to find out) but inevitably after about an hour the we found ourselves on a political topic. Oddly enough heather's mother and I actually agreed a lot on much of what we talked about. After about an hour of debate Heather was clearly uncomfortable that she was the only one on her side and wanted to stop the conversation. Her mother and I immediately stopped the conversation and that was that. \n\nOr so I thought. This morning Heather sent me a text saying that her mother and I upset her last night and that we hurt her feelings. I replied that It is more or less inevitable that we will have heated arguments because of our differing world views and that we need to not take disagreement personally and I understood why she might feel upset because I have been in a similar situation before. Now she essentially wants me to apologize saying we \"ganged up\" on her but I feel as though I have nothing to apologize for. No personal attacks were made. No insults were used. We immediately stopped the conversation once she expressed she was uncomfortable. I fail to see how she was ganged up on. On the one hand I want to just apologize because we are close friends but on the other hand I dont want to apologize for simply expressing my views once the topic got brought up.\nTL;DR:"}

I've only had drinks with him 3 times out of maybe 40-some times we've hung out. Yes, he's gotten really drunk but didn't do anything dangerous or harmful, so I thought it was all in good fun. He says that he has no control over how much he drinks after drink #1 and I totally respect his decision to give it up.\n\nBut my friends and I really like to:\n-Go out to bars on the weekends\n-BBQ and drink beer\n-Order wine at dinner\n-Drink beers on the beach while throwin' around a frisbee\n(You get the picture)\n\nHe doesn't expect me to give up drinking with him AT ALL. But to what extent do I need to take a step back from the regular \"drinking environments\" of my life (listed above) in order to be supportive? I realize this is horribly selfish of me, but I'm bummed that I won't be able to really hang out with my friends and my boyfriend at the same time (very often) if I have to expressively forbid any use of alcohol (\"No ordering a glass of wine at dinner?

I'm worried about how it will be when we start school again in autumn.\n\nShe is a very good friend, and as such I want to maintain my friendship with her.

She lives in a rougher city with a young population.  One night we went out to eat dinner fairly late at a nicer restaurant.  We were both dressed up and she went in a short dress and heels.  After eating, everything was great and we were going to walk to a convenience store to pick up some stuff for the night.  The way to the convenience store was along a darker street with a bus stop on it, and multiple buses parked along the street.  We walked past the first two buses, and when we came to the third bus, a big bald man with a camera stepped down from the bus.  He quickly aimed his camera down and took a picture of my GF's legs... like waist down ish (we were very close to him).  Now both my GF and I were fairly startled.  I wasn't sure how to even handle this so I just sorta glared at the guy and had my GF walk behind me so that the guy couldn't take another picture.  After we got past that street, my GF was visably upset and asked why I didn't do anything.  I understood why she was upset, but I still was not sure what I should have done.  Should I have confronted the guy?  Do I report him to the police?  Is what he is doing even illegal?\nTL;DR:"}

I have depth first search done, and have yet to begin working on breadth first search but i have a few ideas as to how to implement it. My problem is, with the client/driver program that runs all of the classes(contains my main method). I have to scan in text files that contain mazes. I have tested my code by scanning the mazes and everything is working fine. The trouble comes with the instructor says that he wants to be able to put a directory into the command line (args) and have our program parse the directory and solve each maze in the directory. I did directory.list() and place all of the file names in the directory into an array. But I do not know how to make it so my program can scan those files. The program gets upset because the files are not in the same directory as the code. If anyone can help with this I would forever be in your debt.\nTL;DR:"}

I have been working at a corporate america desk job for a media conglomerate for the past 4 years. I have hit a wall and have had enough. My managers are don't care about their employees and I look at them as tenured managers who enjoy their vacation time too much. They lack passion and management skills. As this was the company that hired me out of college, it has been a great way to experience amazing health and retirement benefits while making a decent salary. However, I sit at a computer all day and am not challenged. I have requested to do new work but the new work I am getting is simply inputting data and doing boring work just to shut me up. I have learned that they really don't care about the individual at all, just the overall team in terms of keeping costs low. New hires are making $18 an hour which is way less than I make but their #1 goal is to get employees for cheap. Sitting at a desk and dedicating 50 hours plus a week to keeping a giant corporate machine running in which I have zero passion has forced me to want to quit. I can't take it any longer.\n\nMy family has a retail jewelry store in which I plan on taking to the 21st century. My mom and aunt own it but they do not have an internet presence or market the business. There are areas I can add value so I am excited for my new venture. I love business and listen to podcasts every single day about life and success. I just want to do what I want when I want.\n\nThe question I have for everyone is:\n\n1. Has anyone felt like this before?\n\n2. Is it more strategical to get fired or quit and give 2 weeks notice.\n\n3. Am I entitled to 2 weeks? What if they kick me out right away.\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Recently I have started to question if we are truly meant to be. I am very happy with our relationship it feels very strong however every now and then I wonder. The only flaws in her is we don't share the same hobbies not like it matters a lot. Main thing being I am big into cars and mechanics and she isn't, pretty normal if you ask me.  We share so much in common though things like how we would want to raise our future kids, manage money, education, etc.\n\nSometimes I guess I wonder can I do better can I find someone who fits every thing I want in a girl. Can I find that 10 vs my 9, I know thats asking for way to much however.  No one is perfect and up till recently this girl was the \"perfect one\" it just seems the longer we are together the more I want to look around again sometimes. I am sure if this was someone else I might still feel the same.  Mind you I am 23 now out of college with a full time job, she is still 21 and finishing school. I know a lot of this is me just not being mature and stop thinking I can always \"Do better\". I guess its like owning a new car \"eventually the new car smell goes away\"\nTL;DR:"}

Maybe it is...that's why I'm here seeking some input.\n\nSo, my relationship with my girlfriend is the only \"real/serious\" relationship I've ever had. After dating her for 3 months, I had feelings for her I've never felt for anyone else. She's the only one I've ever pictured myself with far into the future, and she says she feels the same.\n\nMy entire life, I have been very selective of friends. I never had more than two or three at a time. Keeping communication with a lot of people is draining for me, and I never really saw the point. I would rather have two really solid friendships, than 100 surface level ones.\n\nFast forward to this relationship. After a few months of dating, I noticed myself hanging out with her more and more each week, and less with my previous friends. After a while, I just completely stopped (or extremely limited) talking to any friends I had before her, and I am completely happy with that. There is no one else I would rather hang out with or talk to than her, and that's exactly what I want in a relationship. \n\nAbout 6 months into our relationship we moved in together. It was only once we shared a roof, I noticed how often she hangs out with her friends, and leaves me home...alone. She's constantly texting them, calling them, or talking about them.\n\nEssentially, I feel that there are very, very few things I would rather do than be with her, and there is no one I would rather hang out with than her, and it hurts like hell that she doesn't feel the same.\n\nI brought this up to her once, and it really upset her...mostly that I was silently upset with her, and didn't say anything. She said: \"I hate to say this, but it sounds kind of clingy\" ..and she's right, but \"clingy\" isn't a bad thing in my opinion...it's pretty much my ideal relationship. I'm the centre of my girlfriend's universe, and she is the centre of mine....that just sounds awful... /s\nTL;DR:"}

She's a very petite person, at 5'1\", and a normal weigh in at about 107 over her lifetime. At the current time, she weighed herself last night, she was 99. She's been slowly going down from 107, to 105, 103-104, and now the 99/100 that it's at.\n\nA background:\n\n- Her mom's side: both her mother and grandmother have had trouble at times in their lives gaining weight or putting weight on, and have both dipped to around 100 or so.\n- Her gall bladder: was removed during college. This was the beginning of all her horrific stomach problems. She can't digest food at all that well.\n- Her gluten allergy: not Celiac, but is crumpled on the floor if she has it. It's a severe intolerance. She's also is dairy free as that upsets her stomach a lot (IBS)\n- Her trying any new foods: always a bad turnout. It could be something so simple or bland, but if she isn't used to it, she gets horrible pain.\n- Her gastritis: has had it for a while now, maybe a year. Terrible pain there (also acid reflux at times)\n\nSo with all of that said, I should note, my girl DOES eat. She eats good sized (still very, very healthy) meals and has multiple snacks during the day. She is NOT trying to lose weight at all. She has an appointment with yet another GI doctor next week and maybe a nutritionist after that.\n\nBut does anyone have any thoughts? I'm way more nervous than she is over this whole thing. I always told her I'd be nervous if she got below 100. And now we're at that point...\nTL;DR:"}

A popular vine that had been going around was [this one] a potato slowly flying around a room while a kid sings a parody of Frank Ocean's \"Thinkin Bout You\".

I focused my webcam onto the ceiling fan, and flicked on the fan.\nIt was funny at first, watching the potato glide around my room on the strap, I made my friends laugh, mission accomplished. I decided to just leave the potato on the fan, flying around my room.\nWhat I did not know was that my fan was on the highest setting, and the devil's whirlwind was only starting its potato fueled fury.\n\nNow, my room back at my parents house was small. Very small. And this potato was very large and very heavy. I didn't notice what was happening until I heard the fan started to make thunking noises. The potato is zooming across the room, and since the strap hung down, it's at head level with me. I'm panicking, desperately trying to avoid the flying projectile potato, and hopelessly watching it knock everything in my tiny room down. It's hit me at least twice by now, and that shit hurt like hell. All of my friends on Skype are witnessing this happen to me and screaming like idiots. I take my computer and manage run out into to hall, examining the damage- (the potato has started to weigh the fan blade down by now,bending it) before turning off the fan and watching the potato come to a stop.

That was a horrible mistake as he tried to attack me when I got there, completely out of his mind yelling about how much he loved her and all this jazz.

This is 10:45 and I have clearly been drinking as she saw me at a bar. So I of course agree and she invites me into her apartment where it is just the two of us. She then pours us some vodka sodas and we are chatting just like we used to. I find this girl very attractive and interesting. So after the second drink we are sitting close to each other on the couch and I go in for the kiss. Stupid? Maybe, but given the circumstances I didn't think it was out of line. She denies it and then was not upset really, but things were clearly sort of weird. I apologized, said good night and walked home. \n\nWhy would she invite me over that late to her apartment? The whole affair just felt a little cruel and torturous, but I wasn't acting very prudently either. I just want to clear the air and get over this girl.\nTL;DR:"}

However I became very different afterwards, I am finding myself becoming the opposite of him in every way and all common ground is slipping away. Now I love Hindu philosophy, art, history, and much of the things I loved so passionately before.     \n  \nOur relationship has taken a turn for the worst recently and I have spoken to him but nothing seems to change permanently. We seem to argue constantly about our different views and he has a habit of not allowing other viewpoints to be heard. I am constantly shot down and its spilling into everyday life. I have made the effort to learn a lot about things that interest him and our social ideas but it never seems to be enough and he makes no effort to understand what in saying. There is a breakdown of communication and I can seem to fix it. \n\nIs it something to work at, because I don't know if I still love him, there of course brief moments of joy, or are we drifting in two different directions?\nTL;DR:"}

My sister was visiting from college for a weekend, so we'd only get two episodes in if we started it. Well apparently that was a huge violation of trust, according to my girlfriend. She reacted as if I were cheating on her or something. She's under the impression that I intentionally lied to her, and despite the fact that I only ended up watching two episodes, and I'll still gladly rewatch the first season, and the episodes that I watched, she won't accept that. She says that I \"spoiled the fun.\"\n\nDid she overreact? I didn't realize that watching TV was such a committal thing.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU I helped introduce an invasive species into my home state.\nPOST: So, to give some context, my family has a large Louisiana crayfish boil every year. Everyone in the family shows up, and a lot of family friends show up too. There's drinking, catching up with old friends, and a lot of food. But I never ate the crayfish, because the way they squirmed when getting put in the boiling water made me think that they were in pain. One year, I found a few uneaten crayfish at the bottom of the net bag that nobody was thinking of boiling. So, like the good Samaritan I am, I decided to give them a bowl filled with water to stay in and took them home with me. Eventually, I put them into a river that connected to the Columbia by my house. But they turned dark blue in the frigid water, so I thought they were probably going to die. Only a few years later (actually today) did I learn that the Red swamp crayfish, or the ones that my family used for the yearly boil, had started to multiply and out compete the smaller and less aggressive Northwestern Crayfish. I know it probably wasn't all me, but now there's a ban on importing crayfish into Washington and there's an increasing population of the crayfish we just so happened to use that's harming our normal crayfish population.\nTL;DR:"}

Me and my current GF have been off and on for about 4 years. She lives about 2 hours away and the distance has been an issue in the past. Gas isn't cheap and we're both broke college students.\n\nTo make a long story short, I have goals this summer. My biggest one being that I want to move out of my parents house before the age of 25. I also hope to potentially find a new job and spend some much needed time at the gym. I feel as if this current relationship is going to get in the way of that. \n\nThis summer, she expects me to come visit for a week to 2 weeks at a time, that means some major time off of work. On top of this, starting this fall we're probably not going to be able to visit with each other at all as I'm probably going to be more broke than usual and we're both going to be extremely busy with school. \n\nIt is my belief, then, that I should call it quits with her. I've also been yearning to be single again for the past couple of months in general but can't bring myself to break up with and hurt her. I don't want to look back 5 years from now and realize I really had someone and I blew it for selfish reasons. \n\nToday, however, has probably been my best opportunity. Last night she started nitpicking certain things about our relationship and on top of that revealed to me that she's essentially giving her ex a 2 hour ride back up to my town. This is a huge red flag for me but she insists they're just \"friends.\" They snapchat and text constantly and frankly it makes me upset but I don't reveal this to her as I don't want to come off as untrusting. Her nitpicking, to me, is a sign that she is also having mixed feelings about the relationship. \n\nWhat should I do reddit? I'm leaning towards ending it but I don't want to regret it. The best I can hope for is that we can at least remain in contact with each other.\nTL;DR:"}

There's a lot of times he doesn't want to go out because he's tired (meanwhile, I worked 2 jobs and went to school fulltime). He doesn't want to go the gym with me because he \"doesn't see why he needs to.\" He also doesn't know how to communicate with me - so if something is bothering him, or if he does something that bothers me and I communicate it to him, he shuts me out. I think he is bipolar, and he admits that he thinks he is as well. But he doesn't see why he needs to talk to someone. \n\nLately, I've been traveling a lot to Boston for work, and I've noticed that my eyes wander more times than not. I would never imagine cheating on my fianc\u00e9, but I honestly don't know what more I can do. I've suggested counseling, therapy, anything I can do to strengthen our relationship.

I'm just not sure of what to do because I know if we were to break up, he'd be broken. I don't want him hurt, at all.\n\nWe haven't set a date yet, but everyone in our family is so excited about us getting married, and his brother is offering to pay for a lot of it.

They begin blasting extremely loud country music (actually, they put the same song on repeat) and scream their conversation over the music.

My  boyfriend and I felt like creepers and hoped that maybe they would be so exhausted that they would fall asleep.  Wrong.  They turned their music back on and continued to be loud until 4 a.m. and the front desk stopped answering its phone after our first call, therefore we couldn't have anyone come back upstairs and tell them to quiet down.\n\nThe next morning around 8:00, I hear them loudly recounting the events from four hours earlier.  \"Did we get in trouble with security?\" \"How many times did we have sex?\" \"Our music wasn't that loud.\" They decided that they should go back to sleep and we heard the boyfriend say, \"make sure to put the do not disturb on the door so we can sleep in.\" \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to get up and go to brunch, and as we walked by their door we took the do not disturb sign off of their door.

Unfortunately (in my opinion) my wife is the one who always sets these up. I offer little to no input on these things as she's always so good about looking for stuff to do. I've talked to her about it and she doesn't have much of an answer, she \"just finds\" them somehow.

She's not bitter or mad or anything, but I know for a fact that it would ease her burden if she wasn't *always* the one setting stuff up for us to do.

No one is really at fault.  Our relationship moved too fast to be healthy; started dating to moving in together in 3 months, married in 8 months.  We forced our lives together in such a short period of time.  Immigration was a factor, as he is foreign and would be deported without me. Trying so hard to make things work and taking on massive financial challenges took it's toll on how I felt about him and the relationship and I no longer want to continue lying about it. \n\nDuring our last fight I tried to take the opportunity to bring up the issue in a calm way.  I let him know that I feel like we are trying to make things work and damaging ourselves in the process.  I told him I didn't love him anymore and that we needed to discuss what we were going to do about our living situation and his immigration status.  He immediately went into attack mode and tried accusing me of a lot of things that didn't make sense, but after he saw I wasn't relenting or taking it he changed his tune and became contrite and \"wanted to make things work\".  I gave in because in reality, I don't know how my life would logically work without him right now.. I was recently laid off and haven't found employment yet, and I certainly can't afford to move out.  His immigration file will likely be completed in the next few months too, essentially giving him permanent residency and I don't want to mess that up, especially given how much money we've spent on it, though one of the stipulations is that we have to be living together for at least 2 years in order for him to keep it..But I can't make it work with him.  The resentment I feel for him due to recent events has just killed any chance of me feeling anything for him again. I don't want to be in this relationship, but I don't know the smartest way of leaving it without completely ripping apart both our lives.. What do I do..\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [23 M] girlfriend [21 F] of 9 months is EXTREMELY FORGETFUL and sometimes it hurts me.\nPOST: My girlfriend is an amazing girl. She's smart, charming, cute, funny etc etc she basically ticks all the right boxes EXCEPT for one thing: She's extremely forgetful. We could be having a convo about something today, and having the exact same one a week later because she forgot we had already talked about it. Usually this is fine, and I don't mind repeating convos with her because she's great to talk to BUT when it comes to forgetting personal details about me, this is when it starts to hurt.\n\nFor example, on our first date we talked about our favorite songs, and I told her why mine meant so much to me. Lo and behold, a few weeks later we were talking about songs and she asked me what my favorite one was. It was hurtful because if she had a song that was just as special to her, I'm pretty sure I would remember it. Bigger things she has forgotten: our anniversary date, my plans for summer vacation (I had been talking about them FOR MONTHS and she recently asked me what I was doing for summer vacation), my career plans after graduation.\n\nI like this girl so much but it hurts me that she forgets little (and some big) things about me. I know she holds no malice and she genuinely feels sorry when I point out that I already mentioned these things to her before. At first I just teased her about her forgetfulness but lately it has been getting to me. I feel horrible for feeling this way because I know she doesn't mean to forget.\n\nAm I overreacting? Can people be THIS forgetful or is this some sort of medical condition that I'm unaware of? If it IS a medical condition, she has definitely made no mention of it. Other than her forgetfulness, everything about her is perfect so I really don't know what to do here.\nTL;DR:"}

I was in a hurry because I was running late for my next class.  I thought that the door would open 180 degrees, but it only went 90.  In my haste, I rammed into the door and totally faceplanted.  A girl who was walking by immediately began laughing uncontrollably.  She actually had to sit down on the ground because she was laughing so hard.  In between gasps she was doing her best to apologize, but she was absolutely failing to control herself.  I mean, I admit I would have chuckled a bit if it were someone else, but not at all to that extent.  The thing is I wasn't even mad or bothered by it, I was just amused how she was able to laugh so maniacally in the face of someone she never met.  I wanted to express this to her, but I was in such a hurry to get to my class I had to keep moving.  So I just kind of acknowledged her, and gave a goofy grin.  She was still laughing as I walked away, until it faded out because of the distance.  I sometimes think that I could have used that as an icebreaker to ask out a cute girl, and that I potentially would have had a really good how I met your mother/grandmother story.\nTL;DR:"}

He spends a lot of time playing video games and I tend to go out on my own or I play games too, and we both spend time studying or doing homework. I'm not bothered by the lack of sex and he seems content with playing video games now that we've combined consoles and he can play a ton of new games.\n\nUsually I initiate sex because he's almost always is up for it, but he does too sometimes if he knows I have free time and I haven't showered yet for the day. We usually have sex maybe once a week or so.\n\nI realized we both don't have sex as often as we did when we lived apart and at first I was worried that he didn't find me attractive anymore (I find him very attractive of course) but he's made it clear that he is, verbally and physically because he's always grabbing my body and gets turned on very easily when I large t-shirt and nothing else. \n\nEmotionally, we're doing great as well.\n\nI heard this is normal for couples who move in together since they see each other all the time unlike before where they tried to do the most when the time was limited.

Here's the story: I moved to Omaha, NE a few years ago and became involved in a local US Navy museum, Freedom Park. FP is nestled along the Missouri River and was flooded this past year when the infamous flood came along. Two of our biggest exhibits are a WWII minesweeper, the USS Hazard and the Cold War training sub, SST-1 the USS Marlin. A small group of volunteers (including myself) have been tasked with rebuilding the park, luckily with the assistance of the city to its former glory and hopefully better. This brings us to the rough part, and the part where in a way I must whore myself a bit. We are currently applying heavily for federal grants. We hope to build a web site and also set up a non-profit in the near future. Part of this process is also selling the need for the park to the City of Omaha. One thing that is helping in this process is the growth of the following to our existing page, www.facebook.com/freedompark. So, if any of you could help in any way, please, like our page! If you have any artifacts you wish to donate that can also be arranged through the City parks department.

It was a HUGE PITA, but it worked.\n\nWell, that info must have got lost in the switch to Barclay, because once again I'm being told I'm not the primary account holder and would therefore have to get my mom on the phone with them again to jump through more hoops.\n\nObviously I don't want either of us to have to go through this nightmare again...\n\nMy question: do I just cancel the card and take the hit to my credit score from losing that LOC? Or do I put up with this BS from Barclay to get the card downgraded? Something else?\n\nThank you!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Am I [29M] being a jerk about a lack of sex with my new girlfriend[28F]?\nPOST: I'm really confused about my feelings so it'll be nice to get some outside perspective.\n\nI started dating a girl I met online just over 3 months ago. She was very upfront with me that she wasn't interested in rushing into anything sexually, and that she was a virgin because she hadn't met anyone she was interested in sleeping with. In fact she had very little sexual experience whatsoever, never making it past first base with anyone.\n\nI was fine with this and told her I had no problem waiting for a (unspecified) time, but that I did believe a good sex life is important in a relationship and I wouldn't be interested in pursuing a relationship if we weren't eventually moving towards there being a sexual component, which she told me she understood and was fine with.\n\nFast forward three months, and things are still going really well. We've discussed sex a lot and I know she's nervous because she's very small and thinks it's going to hurt - she doesn't seem to get much pleasure from FIV sex and still has her hymen. We don't seem to be moving any closer to sex, and she makes no other efforts to satisfy me sexually in other ways, even though I'm often doing so for her, which she seems to really appreciate.\n\nSo I guess my question is, are we just sexually incompatible? I really like her and I don't mind waiting to have sex, but her lack of desire to take care of me is somewhat offputting; I think reciprocation in a relationship is really important. She says she agrees with that but then makes no effort to reciprocate.\nTL;DR:"}

Well now it has been a year since I have been single, and I still haven't confessed my feelings for her, obviously. She has told me several times that I am one of her favorite people, but I feel like I have been \"friend-zoned,\" which is a term I personally do not like to use.

Well, I was right, we have about 90% of the same interests (at least from the information I could gather) and we even excel in the same classes!\nWell ever since then, knowing how shy I am, I tried updating my facebook more, saying things a bit more out loud, just to tell her that we have the same interests, without actually telling her, hoping that she'd have more balls than me (if the case were where she wants to talk to me); there's no way she doesen't know we share interests, I'm even dubious if she doesen't know that I'm into her, but I'm a man, and stupid, so I can't tell if she feels or how she feels about me.\n\nA few months have gone by, she already has a few (f)friends, although I dont think shes the most comfortable with them.

The woman looked older than me (probably 29 or 30) and did not look particularly pretty.\nI was so shocked but did not send any message to him yet because my guy friend advised me that going all emotional and ballistic will only make him feel good about himself and feed his ego.

I had an abortion (Not his kid.) when I was 19. I'm turning 21 in September.  I knew before I even got knocked up that was the route I'd take if it ever happened. The first thing I thought when I saw that positive pregnancy test was, \"How much does an abortion cost, and how am I going to get this covered?\"\n\nMy reasons for getting it were because I just plain didn't want a kid, and I didn't want to be pregnant. \n\nWhenever I encounter someone who I feel deserves to know, like my current SO, and I know their feelings on the topic, I tell them that my pregnancy was high risk. I tell them that I would have had my life at stake if I'd gone full term. I tell them my heart was racing, and nothing the doctors did would slow it down, and I would have had to been on crazy amounts of medication and there was still a big chance both the fetus and I would have died, so I chose to terminate. This is a great big lie, but it's partially true. During my pregnancy, my heart rate was considerably faster than normal, but it wasn't life threatening.\n\nWhatever the case, this is something I needed to say. I don't regret my decision in terminating. Not one bit. I'm not here to start an argument about pro life vs. pro choice.

I knew he was engaged, but since he just proposed not 3 weeks ago, the marriage was a shock to say the least. What really upset me, though, was how I found out: by opening FACEBOOK. It would be one thing, I guess, if he hadn't told anyone prior to the event and wanted to announce it that way. It's 2016, I can see it.

I'm beginning to feel like a stranger in my own clan. Talking about it with them usually results in \"no you're overreacting\" or \"what? no one left you out intentionally!\" but happening time and time again becomes emotionally devastating. \n\nThey tend to blame this on the fact that I live farther away from them, but they're honestly now so scattered geographically as well that the distance is negligible.\n\nFor what it's worth, I sent all of them invites to my wedding.

I should mention old ex and I have long buried our issues and are friends, as well as bandmates now. \n\nThis is pretty common, and I was going to dump her a week ago but she had a meltdown and I stayed to get her help, which never happened.\n\nSo I snapped and dumped her.\n\nShe's being texting me every 30 seconds for about as many hours begging me to reconsider, that she would get help and get better.\n\nI told her this afternoon that it was more than that (in my anger I wasn't very forthcoming before) that I had no feelings for her and that our lives were in vastly different places.\n\nShe has changed her tune radically, and admitted defeat. She is still clamoring for one last night, of no sex, or romance, just support and friendship so she can go to the psych clinic tomorrow.\n\nI'm torn. She swears she won't try to get me back. I don't know if I can trust that, but I also know she doesn't have much of a support system here and is in bad shape.\n\nWhat to do?\nTL;DR:"}

We had been friends for four months. Although we didn't hang out a lot, I can tell that there is something between us-when I told her I like her after dinner, she looked surprised and told me she had never thought of that, and asked me whether I am looking for a playful relation/ONS-she didn't have time for that. I told her I want a serious relation and I'm cautious in choosing friends.   \nAt last she agreed to text me when she had a decision-okay she is even more cautious than me.\nHowever, we didn't text each other for more than a week, so I was not hoping for that. I started seeing another girl to move on. Almost at the meantime she texted me she likes me. I didn't know how to respond to her and how to explain the situation. \nAs I mentioned above I'm careful in choosing relations, I also have some feelings for the girl I'm seeing now-but definitely not as strong as for her, before I got her message I was trying to build a long-term relations with the girl. \nAnd If I refused her, I can say she would never give me a second chance. There would be no possibilities between us. \nUrgently need some advice, thank you!!\nTL;DR:"}

We get along really well, have great conversations, I feel extremely comfortable around him. The sex is great. In fact, he is the only man I've been with who could get me to climax. But today he expressed that he is tired of always being the one to initiate sex and it's starting to make him feel like I'm not attracted to him.\n\nI am VERY attracted to him. I look at him when he's just out of the shower or when he's walking around with his shirt off and I think to myself, \"Damn, he looks good!\" (seriously). But when we're together I'm more thinking about how I want to cuddle, or I want to watch a movie, or watch the game, etc. I'm just not a very sexually motivated person.\n\nI have never once turned him down when he's initiated sex so it's not like he should be afraid of rejection. I get where he's coming from, because if a man never initiated sex with me I would start to feel self conscious, too.\n\nAny advice on getting myself to initiate sex despite the fact that it's just not at the forefront of my mind? I have no problem with my sex drive, because once the heavy petting starts I'm all for it.\n\nThanks in advance :)\nTL;DR:"}

Me being me, very protective I got kind of worried and upset and told her it was a bad idea etc.. Then she said she would be fine and I kept trying to tell her it was dumb idea. She kept insisting she would be fine, so I got a bit upset and decided I would go eat dinner and not talk to her while she does her thing.

He said she described him as a \"shitty person\" for not being a \"kid person.\" He told me he doesnt like gatherings with kids- like parties/outings.

Low weight, short, and not as verbal as I was told he should be...\nPOST: My son just turned 2 in June. He is a smart little booger and keeps us on our toes. I always thought he was perfect until I went to his 18 month check-up and was told he was too small and that he should be talking more. After that appointment, I started comparing him to other toddlers his age and realized he was behind. He communicates in all ways possible except not much verbally. Momma, Daddy, Nana, yes, this, and don't are all he says, though I feel this is just due to us giving in to what we know he is trying to say. I am not worried so much about his talking as I am about his weight... at 25 months he is a tiny 22-23 lbs! He was 19-20 lbs at a year :-( Other toddlers his age are at or around 30 lbs. \n\nWe have been struggling to get him to eat. He nibbles and picks at his food. He is very picky about textures and won't eat anything slimy, mushy, or anything strange in general. Even if I make his favorite foods (which really has hardly any nutritional value like mac n' cheese or pancakes) he eats so little it stresses me out! I don't force him to eat and let him come back later if he decides he is hungry to nibble on it some more. We always make sure he eats with us, and if we are eating outside of the normal meal time, he will munch on what we are having as long as he likes it. His regular babysitter makes sure he eats eggs, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, and a protein shake to help with his weight but even that doesn't seem to be helping. Am I going about this all wrong? Any tips and suggestions are much appreciated! We were told to enroll him in an Early Learning program for his speech, but I think we will wait on that until he is closer to 3.

I met Ralph my freshman year in college and we have become fast friends. Ralph has a girlfriend named \"Alexa\" and they have been dating for years. I have also become friends with Alexa because of my friendship with Ralph.\n\nI am currently suspicious that Alexa may have feelings for me. Whenever I am hanging out with them and my other roommates, Alexa will say that I'm her favorite friend of Ralph's. Whenever we go to parties she will often come and dance with me rather than Ralph. However when Ralph comes over to where we are she always starts to dance with him. While we're at parties she also takes a lot of snapchats with me. Alexa also often invites me to accompany her and Ralph on trips, one example being skiing. \n\nThese reasons only caused mild suspicion, but about a month ago Alexa asked me an odd question at a party while we were both drunk that caught me off guard, \"Hey anon, do you think I'm pretty enough for Ralph?\" I responded \"of course,\" but I got the feeling she wanted me to say she was out of his league. After that she invited me to come upstairs with her to the bathroom. I declined and went back to hang out with Ralph.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we decided to leave and one of Alexa's friends went and got her from upstairs. Upon coming down the stairs I teased her about an inside joke and she slapped me.\n\nTo clarify, Alexa is very attractive but I don't want to be that asshole that betrays his good buddy.

At the time, we lived in Texas, but we have since moved to California. I have cut all ties with my family, as they are all horrible, cruel people, and I want to make sure that if something happens to me, my family will have no claim on my IRA (opened in Texas but with a national brokerage firm) or any of my bank accounts (all opened in Texas but with a national bank). We're not talking massive amounts of money by any stretch of the imagination. This is more out of principle.\n\nSame-sex marriage is only legal in some states. Other states will not recognize my marriage, and things such as inheritance and property ownership are thus not automatic. Yes, there are tons of legal challenges in Texas and other states for marriage equality, but for all intents and purposes, our marriage is not recognized in the state of Texas at all, and that leaves my nightmare of a mentally ill mother as my next of kin.\n\nMy wife is a banker, and she said that there are some differences (could just be operational in nature, we're not sure) in accounts--that here in Calif., a teller would be able to tell that my checking account is a \"Texas\" account.\n\nYes, I could close all my accounts and open new ones, but I first want to make sure that I have a reason to; otherwise, I'm going through the big inconvenience for nothing.

At no point is it cool to go have a fling with somebody just because you're randy and need to get your rocks off! \n\n.\n\nThat said, I have an exception.  Bisexuals.  It goes both ways.  When I was steady with my girlfriend for two years, she and I both saw no problem in me getting it on with another dude.  She thought it was sexy and fun, and I had no problem with it whatsoever. Later, when I was full time with a guy, I couldn't conceive of being with another guy even in a casual romantic setting, or a one night fling.  Even a threesome with another guy would have caused me emotional distress.  But I wouldn't have thought twice about getting it on with a hot chick at the bar, and would have thought my boyfriend was weird to condemn me for that. \n\nI realize both the title example and this one are sexual examples, but that's what was on my mind at the starting of this thread.\nTL;DR:"}

It was a hard time, but looking back at it now, I feel like I've become a stronger person afterwards. I lived with my mum and 2 sisters (one older, one younger) for a few years and went to my dad almost every weekend. Both parents found a new partner and got married again. They still are. \nNow here it comes..  My stepmother is great, she already had two daugters from a previous wedding and they're about my age (and my sisters) and we got along from the first moment.\nMy stepfather hadn't been married, never had kids. So he was used to being alone. Still, he chose for me and my sisters too when he married to my mother. The first year was great. We played tennis together etc. Then, he and my mum decided to have more kids. 2 of them..\n2 more girls came along. Ever since that moment, me and my sisters started to feel unwelcome in the family. My mum did not make any difference between her kids, but my stepfather always has.\nTwo years ago, my youngest (real) sister decided to move out to my dad. My mum was heartbroken, but the relationship between my sister and my stepfather didn't work.  Now, we have come to a point where my oldest sister wants to move out too. And I have no idea what to do. Moving out too would totally break my mum, but staying in this place being unwanted might break me..\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [21 F] and my boyfriend [24 M] stay at his house a lot. He has a roommate [24 M], so how can I be a better guest?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been dating since about the end of August. We are both super busy with school and a lot of the time we don't see much of each other during the day. Because of this, we stay together almost every night. Probably more than half the weeknights we end up staying at his place, and most weekend nights as well because his house is so close to downtown. I've recently moved in with my sister and our rooms are right next to each other which makes sex a little awkward, so I'm sure our sleepover situation will continue to be more than half the time at his place. \n\nHis roommate is friendly and we get along well, but he has made some little jokes about us all living together. On weekdays I almost never go over there until nine or later and I leave early in the morning to shower at my own house. On weekends sometimes we make breakfast there and occasionally hangout there during the day, but his roommate isn't home a lot of the time on weekends. Occasionally my boyfriend and I cook there, but always after his roommate so we're not hogging the kitchen or anything. \n\nBasically I just want to know how I can be a better guest while I stay there, because I am there A LOT. What are the \"rules\" for staying at a boyfriend's house with a roommate? Also any advice about sex? The apartment is small, and we try to be quiet but we're probably not always as successful as we could be. My boyfriend told me that his roommate has commented on us waking him up a couple times, always in a joking manner though, but because we have sex pretty much every night I think this might be the biggest thing to worry about. I don't think I need to offer to pay utilities because I don't ever shower there, and the most energy we add is watching Netflix in my boyfriend's room, which he would usually be doing anyways. But should I buy toilet paper or hand soap or anything? Any advice is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not a sucker and I think that's crap, but I was and still am confused about why he wants to spend so much time with me if he's not happy.

Girlfriend just started going back to school, shifted position to a minimum wage job and dropped from full-time to part time, taking a pay cut and lost benefits.\n\nManagement turnover happens, new manager started working a month or so. Chaos ensues, shortage of workers and my girlfriend ends up working overtime to cover shifts in her new front desk position. New manager is impressed with her stepping up and keeping the place from falling apart, plans to create a new \"training position\" and give her a 20% raise. Not bad, what's the catch?\n\nToday he tells her that she will be expected to be available to answer her phone whenever a co-worker has a question. My question to you: is this in any way enforceable from a legal standpoint? I'm happy for her because she really wants the pay increase. I am also worried, she has been repeatedly saying she does not want to take work home with her, and that she needs to focus on her schoolwork. I am also worried that she will somehow be responsible for some stupid issue that happens while she is not working and unable to answer the phone.\n\nMy advice to her is to accept the position and answer the calls when she wants to. Has anyone have any experience with anything like this before? I'm stuck in the mindset that thinks that she should be paid on-call if she is expected to drop her personal life for work. The hourly raise seems to be the other side of that mindset - she is being paid more to accept that responsibility.\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little more than two years. \n\nHer family is a very open, and friendly one. They've welcomed me into the family and I truly enjoy spending time with them. A couple weeks ago, during a family barbecue, they told me that they (her parents, and her two brother's families) had planned a vacation to India for the coming Christmas holidays. They invited me along as well, and also said it would be very nice if I could help translate for them, and also give them a more immersive experience in terms of sight seeing and discovering local culture, since I was a local. In addition, they also mentioned that it would be a great family bonding trip, and my girlfriend added that she really wanted to see the place where I grew up. To be perfectly honest, I felt a little bit insulted. I don't know, perhaps this is me being oversensitive, but assuming I'd essentially be a free guide for them was a bit degrading. My response was a bit rude as a result, I told them I wasn't interested in being a free guide, and that I also wasn't interested at all in coming along with them on their vacation, in addition to having a few choice words for their request. \n\nHer family were a bit taken aback, and just remained silent My girlfriend, on the other hand, was pissed, and stormed home. And so, for the last two weeks, my girlfriend has been pretty pissed at me and we've barely had a conversation since. When I asked her what I could do to fix this, she says I need to apologize for my behavior, and reconsider my decision, two things I'm not entirely sure I want to do right now. \n\nWe've been at this impase for a while, and I'm not sure what to do now.

There has been a great deal of hesitation on her part to move forward, both in lieu of her previous relationship ending poorly, and her hesitation to trust me after how we ended our relationship years ago.  I am comfortable with this to a point.  I know that she needs time before jumping into something committed again.  \n\nThe issue is that I don't, and striking a compromise has proven rather difficult.  I want something real, something stable, and something that I can see leading towards a long lasting committed relationship.  I never stopped loving her, and I have to trust her when she says she feels the same for me.  But I fear that if this continues, resentment is going to start to build.  I know that if she is looking for something different, that it's not wrong, it's just not right for me.\n\nI don't want to renege on the promise I made to give her time, but I don't know how much more I can compromise my wants in order to satisfy hers.\n\nI try to communicate my feelings to her, and afterwards there is little to no back and forth.  I want to spend as much time as I can with her and include her in my life, and it feels that she seldom tries to include me in hers.  I can't keep pouring myself into this cup alone, and I'm starting to get tired of it.\nTL;DR:"}

If so, did you keep it?\nPOST: I thought up this question looking around ask.reddit, I'm 15 years old, almost 16 now. Recently, I found some money, it was 20$, that was the most money I've ever found on the ground by accident. What happened was that I was skating with a couple of friends after there was a storm the other day. My friend and I found a wallet with 40$ in it, the bills were all soaked and wet. That didn't matter to us, we got so lucky even seeing it to begin with. We kept the money, because there wasn't a chance that the person who lost his wallet could of found it.

He tried to once initiate it with me recently, but I was tired and a little hung over so I rejected him and said no and now he has given up trying to initiate anything with me and tells me he is just going to masturbate instead. \n\nI hardly initiate because of my low sex drive, im on the Pill and I have PCOS, which can both diminish it. I can still get horny though, so not all hope is lost. Thing is, he won't initiate with me any more, and rejects me when I initiate. This is an on going problem in our relationship, whenever I dont feel into it and say no, he gives up in protest and doesn't initiate when he wants it. \n\nI have told him, that when I am horny, I will initiate. But I want him to intiate when he wants it and if he gets me horny during it or im not tired, I will do stuff with him. He even rejects my bj offers. \n\nHe doesn't seem to understand my low sex drive, and has told me its because i dont find him attractive. He is so wrong, I do find him attractive, that has nothing to do with it. Its hormonal caused for me, but I am trying to help myself. \n\nBut he is getting nasty about it, this morning he said to me ' you dont do anything with me or hug me at night (he is a hugger), what is the point of you?'. He then took it to another level by saying 'I'm just going to masturbate instead and maybe one day i'll find someone who finds me attractive and wants to do it with me'. He really doesn't understand and he is impossible to talk to. He just wont listen to me. I'm starting to believe, the way he deals with problems is actually putting my sex drive down, cos this honestly is not attractive behaviour.\nTL;DR:"}

That's what she was doing up until getting fired from her last job last month, after she texted me a photo of her gripping a wad of $100 bills. She's making good money! Great! I talked to her last week, and she is apparently now on the brink of homelessness upon becoming unemployed. This has happened several times throughout the last couple of years. It's a statistically common enough situation in the US, but the juxtaposition of that kind of text, which signifies she's making good money, with the fact that she never seems to be stable as a result concerns me. She lives in a very cheap city, has no student loans, and does not own a car, so my guess is that it's not cost of living that's eating up her checks, but she still can't seem to make money translate into stability. She shows no signs of being interested in 'getting it' on her own. I want to see her be long term stable, especially if she's going to keep waiting tables.

I normally give advice here under a different nom de guerre, but this time I'm looking for your perspectives.\n\nA summary of my romantic life for context: I spent the past year single, but before that I was in two long-term relationships almost continuously since I was in my mid-teens. I dated my first GF for several years simply because she was the first woman who ever showed attraction to me, but I dated my second for several more years because we were a much better fit and I actually loved her back. The second one lasted 4.5 years, and if I had to describe it succinctly, I'd say it was the period in my life that radiated a warm glow, full of vivid colors and a sense of infinite potential. Well...in the first couple of years when things were going well, anyway. During the entirety of my first and during the final year of my second relationship, I've been on the receiving end of every dysfunctional-relationship issue that routinely gets posted to r/relationships.\n\nSince I became single, I've tried various avenues of dating, and even though I've met many new women who are amazing in their own right, I always feel myself \"closing\" when the sparks start flying. The reactions are purely involuntary - instead of feeling excited about sharing personal details with a new person, I'd feel dread about what will happen when the honeymoon period ends. Or what will happen when distance or another person intrudes on the relationship. **Basically, dreading the storm clouds in the distance that will eventually but inevitably move overhead. It's preventing me from enjoying the sunshine and butterflies at the beginning of every relationship.**\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable that I'm taking the lessons from my previously-failed relationships to heart, but I'm worried that cynicism and over-caution will drain the passion out of any new relationship that I pursue.\n\nr/relationships, what are your thoughts and experiences on this?\nTL;DR:"}

We have been living together with another roommate for the last year or so and also have a dog together. I just finished my last semester of college and found myself a full time job and she still has 1 year of school left.\n\nThroughout our relationship we have had minor qualms with things that bothered us but have always worked on improving the relationship. The biggest problems she says I do is I will spend too much time on my computer when we are together, and is something I am working on. I feel like she doesn't reciprocate the same amount of love and affection I show towards her, and that is something she is working on.\n\nThis last month she said she wanted to move out and find somewhere else to live as she feels we treat each other better when we spend time apart. I can agree on that but I feel that if she were to leave, we would eventually lead to breaking up. I have also been jealous of an ex boyfriend of hers that she text quite often. They have been long time friends and I believe her when she says nothing is there, but in my gut I do worry she is wishing she was with him.\n\nHopefully the information I provided makes sense and draws a decent picture of our relationship. \n\nMy question is what can I do to make sure this relationship grows and becomes stronger as I really would like to be with this lady?

She was like \"you're still here? and ehhhh\" (about the final) and walked off. Btw another friend came out at the same time as her and started talking to me when I asked her that question. Honestly my first impression of that response was wtf.... so I had to cut my friend short and started catching up to her. Called her out a few times but no reaction until I got closer and asked her why she was heading off so quickly like that. She responded \"I wasn't walking that fast\".

For a long time now, I have had feelings for my best friend.  Because this relationship was so valuable to me, I had avoided confessing my true thoughts for her out of fear that they would interfere with and ultimately worsen the bond we have.  However, due to a number of circumstances, I have recently confessed these feelings to her, and I have since handled this in the worst way.  In part because these feelings have been bottled up for a while now, in part because I have some major self-esteem issues, and in part because she is a very long distance away and I have not seen her in a bit, I have become an emotional roller coaster - one day letting her know that no matter what she will always be my best friend and the next suggesting that we should cut off all ties because \"just friends\" can't work.

We saw each other multiple times/week, talked all the time, and had sex. Eventually it got to her giving the \"Let's just be friends\" and \"I don't want to ruin our friendship with sex\" speech after I addressed some mixed signals I started to get. (and was pretty sure she met another guy or was talking to an ex again)\n\nShe was vague during that conversation and kept changing what she was saying and I had enough and just told her that If she only wanted to be friends, and nothing more, than that isn't something that I can do this far into the game and that's probably going to be it.\n\nShe didn't like that line, and quickly decided to bring the conversation to an end. I sort of sensed an \"Ok, I'll give you exactly what you want\" mentality from her at this point. Everything was civil though, and there was never any yelling or arguing.\n\nAs much as I didn't want to do that, I know myself well enough to know that if I continue to stick around, I'll just be hurting myself even worse down the line that I am right now. \n\nIt's going totally against what I said, but I tried reaching out (by text) twice since then (6 weeks ago), and have gotten nothing back.\n\nI didn't want to burn a bridge like this, and I am having a very hard time dealing with it. Especially because I'm now being ignored.\n\nWas it selfish for me to say what I did? Did I say it wrong? Do I deserve to be ignored?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25 M] with my GF [27 F] 1 year, she gets texted by a guy and deletes it... worth airing out??\nPOST: Firstly I already had to go through something similar with her like two weeks ago. She had this ongoing convo with a guy, he started asking her out and stuff and I told her I found it disrespectful. Asked her to stop and she did. But she showed me she has it in her to talk to other dudes in some format or another (I feel like we are intimate enough to where that shouldn't be the case.)\n\nSo that ended with me accepting at face value that it was nothing more then that, I reassured her I trust her and so forth... I let it go. \n\nFast forward to recently. I clear as day see her get texted by \"chad\" (pretty sure she didn't see me see the notification). She goes and takes a abnormally long shower with her phone (like in the bathroom 30 minutes when it usually takes her 10). \n\nShe comes back, leaves her phone and goes in the other room. \n\nI check it... (judge me if you want, we are thinking about moving in together and I rather be safe then sorry)... and the text convo from \"chad\" is deleted. She knows I know her passcode. \n\nThat's about all I have to go on. Seems she's texting someone again a mere two weeks after I let her know this was bothersome. \n\nCould just be she doesn't want to start drama, it's really nothing and she just deleted it (as to not start problems). \n\nCould be some thing else. \n\nSo we spend a LOT of time together (every night at her or my place, literally every night). There's not really any opportunity for her to do anything. Like at worse this is probably emotionally cheating? Or its nothing. \n\nI just called her out like two weeks ago. Don't really want to \"rock the boat\" again...? Plus I'd have to admit to snooping through her phone after telling her just days ago that I trust her. \n\nDo I let this go and keep my eyes open or is this a no-brainer call her out situation?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What is the most bizarre/cool experience you've ever had while stoned?\nPOST: One day I was in a park with a good friend of mine and we had smoked a bit, listened to good music, and walked around in the remnants of Military planes and airport equipment. Eventually we decided to head home. When we attempted to cross a major street, we were stopped by a police blockade with an estimated total of over 100 vehicles (SWAT vans, motorcycles, blacked-out Mercedes vans) with snipers, army personnel, riot police, etc. In one of the last cars followed the pope (unfortunately not in the pope-mobile), who was apparently visiting our city without our knowledge. Afterwards, the street returned to normal, the remaining policeman began to smile and chat with passers-by, and we were allowed to cross. It struck us that we had just accidentally witnessed something that millions of Catholics hope to do their whole lives. While really high. \n\nHas anyone else had a very strange or cool experience like this happen to them?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [22/m] Girl [20] bored of me?\nPOST: Hi. A couple of months ago I met a girl and since then we've hooked up approx 10 times. In between those 'dates' there was actually no communication between us. Now, this month things began to speed up, I saw her a couple of times and we were chatting multiple times a week on fb. Two weeks ago she even texted me out of the blue late at night if I could come over (I did). Six days later we went to the cinema/diner but that night I couldnt stay over because she was tired and feeling sick (it was really late). I found this a bit weird because sleeping can be just sleeping... It wouldn't disturb her. We made some vague arrangements to go to the cinema the next week. I texted her when I would be able to go, the next day. I waited 2 days for a reply.. nothing, I sent her another text to which she replied she couldn't go.  \nAlso, it seems to me that since that last date, she has blocked me on facebookchat. She had some specific moments when she was online, I haven't seen her online since our last date (while she's obviously using it). Hell, I even see her 'likes' passing by in the stream and she appears offline, so it's pretty obvious.   \nI'm guessing I did something wrong/made a bad impression during last date, and now she's locking me out? Is there any 'positive' reason why she would block me on facebook chat? Does she need some time off? I don't get it.. And no, I'm not an obsessive 'chat-starter', she initiated probably more conversations than me. The main reason why I'm so confused is that in our communication she is (was) acting totally normal (on the last date, in her text...). And yes, I could just ask... but I need to get these things straight before I do so. Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [24 M] am going out for lunch with my crush [24 F]. How do I NOT make it looks like \"hanging out as friends\"?\nPOST: I've had a crush on this girl for couple of months now. We met as friends and then I helped her make her website and so far we have only met with a purpose of seeking each other's professional help. We both are freelancers so it was quite casual with chit chats, nothing too formal.\n\nNow I was planning to ask her out for dinner and see how things go but unexpectedly we are meeting tomorrow for lunch. I didn't ask her out, it just happened that we both are free only during lunch time so I said \"Let's have lunch then\".\n\nThis is the first time we are socially hanging out and I really wanted it to be a date but from the looks of it, it doesn't quite look like one. \n\nNow I am afraid I might get stuck in the friend zone. How do I convert this casual lunch into a date? Or do I ask her out for a proper dinner date *after* meeting for lunch? Also, I suck at flirting. I always get nice and friendly with the girl. What do I say to make it look like I am actually interested in her and I'm not hanging out just as friends?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [27 F] with my boyfriend [30 F] of 3 years, will I ever stop feeling jealous of every other woman he comes into contact with??\nPOST: I have had this issue almost my entire adult life, and even as a teenager when I was dating my first boyfriend. I suffer from very low self-confidence, so I am pretty sure that is the cause of the problem but I have been in therapy for my anxiety, low self-esteem, and other issues for the past 6 months and while it has helped a bit I still get incredibly upset and jealous when another female talks to or comes in contact with my current boyfriend of 3 years. We live together and he is great, he does not give me any reason to worry and he knows of my insecurities and usually makes me feel at-ease and is honest and upfront about things that he knows might bother me. But every so often, he will tell me an ex texted him to see how he is doing or a woman flirted with him at work or something of the sort and I'll get very upset and read into it too much instead of just letting it go like a normal person would and just feel as though he could be taken away from me at any moment. I don't understand why I keep feeling this way, and it makes me so exhausted looking into everything and wondering if he will one day cheat on me with one of these women. Additionally, I know it is hurtful to him too because he genuinely seems hurt that I don't fully trust him. Any advice by someone who has been in this situation on what else I can do besides the therapy I'm currently getting would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (22f) can't even tell if I'm being overly sensitive anymore\nPOST: Hey Reddit, my boyfriend (24) and I have been dating for 2 years and apart from some small stuff we've had a relatively smooth go. However, some things he does drive me absolutely insane and I can't tell anymore if it's just his personality or if something else is going on.\n\nThis all came to a head yesterday. Someone in his family recently gave birth and we talked about going to visit. I said I wasn't sure if I could go but will keep him posted throughout the day. 3 p.m rolls around and I msg him saying, \"hey when are we leaving, what are we bringing etc\". He responds and then says, \"oh btw James is coming lol\".\n\nFirst I was confused and then I was really pissed off. James is his best friend of 10 years. I have no problems with any of his friends but (and we've had this fight before) whenever it is the 3 of us hanging out my boyfriend will show 0 affection. We can't hold hands, can't peck, can't snuggle for too long or even have inside jokes. He says he feels bad because James has never had a girlfriend and has really low self esteem so he doesn't want to rub our relationship in his face. We argued for a bit but he wasn't getting why I so upset so I just stopped responding.\n\nTo keep this story short, I didn't end up going to see the baby because I feel like we keep having the same argument that is centred around my boyfriend not treating me differently than his friends (if that makes sense). I just feel like there are some \"life milestones\" or whatever that you should share with your partner and those things should be special. \n\nI guess my question is, would anyone else be upset?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: Make sure you tell the people in your life you love them.\nPOST: Normally I'd be greeting my students as they walked into class, and they'd cry because they don't want to leave their parents after a long weekend. Well today its not the children who are crying but me who is choking back a million tears. You see, today is the day my heart will be forever broken, today is the day I have dreaded my entire life, today is the day I say good bye to my other half, my best friend, my robot, my corner stone, my Dorian. I wrote a five page farewell letter to him, to put in his casket as my best friend will be lowered into a six foot hole. He will be under my feet for the rest of time. I know now that he no longer has to suffer the pain of living but now enjoy watching the rest of us suffer and fuck up in life. He has made me the person i am today. He has picked me up when I tried to take my life after I failed at being a woman and had a miscarriage. He made me get my act together and get out of my depression and go back to school. He is the reason I work a full time teaching job and am going to get my doctored in geology. That day, that I can put the Dr. In front of my name I know it'll be because of him. So I ask, as I hold back ten years of tears today and face the hardest thing to do in my 22 years of living, for you to simply hug everyone in your life you care about because you never know, one day they will be there sending you terrible text with terrible grammar because it pisses you off because reddit has taken over your life, and the next day be cold as stone.\n\nThank you for reading this, I just had to rant.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: I was looking for a room to rent and have been frauded online, now I don't know what to do. Can anyone help?\nPOST: A few weeks ago I started looking for flats/rooms to rent as I am moving out of my parents home and going to university. So I start looking online and one day a really beautiful 1br apartment came up and it was $100 p/w so being the naive person I am, I thought I had hit the renting jackpot. \n\nI got in contact with the guy and he told me all about his apartment and how he wasn't stressed for cash because he wanted someone that would take really good care of the place. I thought I was perfect for the place seeing as I'm extremely clean and thought it was just fate doing something good for me for once. Also he wasn't looking to meet because of course he lives in the states and I'm from New Zealand so I wouldn't have to make a day trip 10 hours away to where the apartment was so I thought it was perfect. \n\nSo he asks for $800 all up, $400 (4 weeks bond) + $400 (4 weeks rent in advance) via Weestern Union . Skip to Friday (02/07/2014) I'm at my local post office sending the money through Western Union. I get an email today (02/09/2014) saying that he wanted another 4 weeks rent in advance ($400) because his lawyer said it was a good idea, this is when I got very suspicious. I looked into New Zealand tenancy laws which then confirm that landlords are not allowed to ask for more than 2 weeks rent in advanced at the time, my stomach dropped and I knew I had been scammed, it was in the back of my mind through the whole exchange but I chose to ignore the signs out of naivety and wanting a nice place for my own, life would have been perfect. \n\nSo sure enough I look at the websites (where I found the apartment) safety guide and all the warnings on 'How to spot a suspicious flat profile is' is exactly what I had just done. I emailed him back saying that I would try to send the deposit ASAP so he's still expecting another $400. What should I do reddit? My classes start next money, and I have NO money! Can anyone help?\nTL;DR:"}

It makes me really uncomfortable not knowing exactly what's going to happen. I am weird, I know I'm weird. But that's just me. I am a crazy organised person and when things don't go according to plan I freak out. I organise most things months in advance and knowing exactly when things are going to happen makes me feel calm. I know it's silly. But that's me\n\nMy boyfriend, Brian and I have been dating for 5yeaes and live together. His great, no other issues etc. But my issue is every time he goes out he will do things like tell me he will be home at 1am then come home at 3am. Every. Time. He goes to the pub with his friends across the road. Tells me 10, comes home at 11.30. Stuff like that. The worse one was he told me 1am, I texted him to ask him where he was at 2am and then checked Facebook when he didn't respond. He had made a status saying \"can anyone pick us up and take us home\" 15 minutes AFTER I messaged him. I have my fucking licence. I could have got him.\n\nI have conversations with him and tell him how uncomfortable this makes me. He says he understands then does it again. I'm literally in tears because he told me I would pick him up at 12 (we have heaps to do tomorrow) so I have been waiting up for 4 hours (I have only had 3 hours sleep and am desperate for bed) then he texts me half hour before I leave and is like \"btw I am staying out till whenever I want and am getting myself home\".\n\nI know it's silly that it makes me so uncomfortable. But I'm literally crying because I am so upset that plans have changed last minute. He knows it upsets me and still does this everytime. **side note I can't sleep without him there so I have to wait up, otherwise I take a sleeping pill early but now it's too late to do that\nTL;DR:"}
