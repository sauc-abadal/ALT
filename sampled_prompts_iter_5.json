Now, areas south and north of us are rapidly developing, and the area is now (supposedly) covered well by Sprint, Virgin, & T-mobile.\n\nWe right now have a 120/mo bill for three basic phones. My mother hates the 'contract' aspect; I hate the price and inability to get a nice smartphone (to use on wifi) without paying an extra 30/mo. For that same price, I could go to sprint and get a significantly better package.\n\nSome options I considered:\n1) Going to Virgin or T-mobile and going pay-as-you-go, with a smartphone. Virgin has some awesome plans.\n\n2) Using an iPod touch in wireless areas (I spend 90 percent of my time in wireless) and paying lime2 10/mo, then using a throwaway phone linked to my mom's account for the car/emergencies. She could just get an absolute bare-bones individual plan from a provider, since she travels but only uses her phones in emergencies.\nTL;DR:"}

Details inside...\nPOST: About 1.5 years ago I signed 1-year lease with a woman(\"Betty\") on a condo I own. After the year was up, it automatically went to a month-to-month. Betty direct-deposited rent into my bank account. No issues, so I have not spoken to her in months.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I called to check in with her -- no urgent reason, but just wanted to make sure everything was in good repair. And see if she was planning to stay.  Phone number didn't work. I sent a letter. It was returned. Thought it might be a mistake, so I stopped by. Nobody was there. I slipped it under her door. \n\nI also sent an email to one of the neighbors to check in. Neighbor responds a couple of weeks later with a long email saying Betty's friends moved in a couple of months ago and Betty moved out. From my perspective, I have been getting paid rent by the new people (yay) but have no idea who they are and the neighbor says they yell, scream, slam doors, smoke pot, sell crack and have a dog that barks a lot. I have learned all of this in the past week and I want to figure out my options. \n\nAre these new people my tenants in a legal sense? I have been taking money from them in exchange for them living on my property, but I was not aware of where the money was coming from, since they have just been depositing it directly into my bank account for he past couple of months. Can I easily evict them? Do landlord/tenant laws (Alaska) even apply here? I have no proof they are selling or doing drugs (just the neighbor's email, but I don't think she is lying. Maybe exaggerating a bit or being gossipy.) I am probably going to contact a lawyer, but wanted to ask here first to help me prepare.\nTL;DR:"}

It ended, and after a year (where we both got counseling for our issues) we decided to try again. As with many \"troubled\" relationships, the first two months were pretty great. Honeymoon period, so to speak. Then everything went downhill around January. Her libido plummeted, and I began to feel strongly dissatisfied with the relationship. She has her own social life, which includes dancing, and although at first I didn't have a problem with it, now that the sex has dried up, it makes me feel extremely threatened. (I know there can be other reasons for decreased libido other than infidelity, but she has not made it why she suddenly doesn't want it beyond \"I feel like for you everything is about sex\" )\n\nWe went to counseling again for these issues. It hasn't helped much yet, we have another session scheduled for next week. What I want to know is whether I should trust her and keep trying, or if I'm just being a huge idiot who is being used for convenience/emotional support.\n\nSome other details-\n\n1. We are generally OK at communicating, and there is intimacy, but I am not sexually fulfilled.\n\n2. She has asked me not to initiate sex, that she will let me know when she wants it (is it just me or this a huge red flag???). This was after I expressed dissatisfaction, and now it has almost been a week, which is much less physical intimacy than I require.\n\n3. Dissatisfaction is also due to the fact that I often feel she doesn't contribute sufficiently to the relationship.\n\nGiven that our relationship has been extremely negative in the past, I want to protect both myself and her, and that might include breaking up, but any time I bring it up she accuses me of secretly wanting her gone. I feel like she wants the relationship, but isn't willing to make any concessions towards my happiness at all, whereas I do a lot of the time.\nTL;DR:"}

I would consider myself a \"nice\" guy, I have dated and had sex with girls in the past but never treated them badly.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with that but my current girlfriend and I have agreed NOT to have sex until we're ready/married.\n\nTHE SITUATION\n\nWe've been dating for about 3 months and we occassionally spend the night at each other's houses. One night she was wearing a dress so she borrowed a shirt and some gym shorts to sleep in. The next day she wore them home and her mom saw them in her laundry (somehow she just knew they were mine). Her mom didn't say anything about it but she made a very \"suspicious\" face towards my girlfriend. She's very close with her parents and knows that they will want to talk about it next time she comes home.... \n\nI'm very open with my parents and tell them everything that I do. So when my girlfriend asks me, \"What am I supposed to tell my parents?!\", I don't have much to offer.... *Please advise\nTL;DR:"}

I met this girl through a couple of friends. We didn't talk much that first night, but we have some mutual friends and they said she's awesome. I liked her enough to ask her out, we went on a first date about 2 weeks ago. It was really pleasant, I felt very relaxed but excited to hang out with her.\n\nShe was traveling in Europe for past 1.5 weeks, but she has since returned. We went on a second date yesterday (went to dinner at a cute restaurant, then got dessert at another place. I paid for dinner, she got us dessert & drinks!).\n\nI had a great time last night, and I'd like to ask her out again. I haven't really dated very much (dated same girl since senior year of college till about 6-7 months ago). So, here are my questions:\n\n1. I didn't make a move last time because I felt like she's a conservative girl and also, since I hadn't seen her in almost 2 weeks, I personally felt like holding off. That's ok, right?\n\n2. When I first reached out to her, it was via Facebook. Thus far we've only communicated about dates via Facebook, but we exchanged phone numbers when we were to meet up last time (not last night). Should I message her on Facebook or should I text her?\n\n3. I'm thinking of either taking her to a cool art show OR to my favorite park in our little city (very peaceful, cute park that few people know about so its one of my favorite places to hang out on a good weather day) during the day on Saturday or Sunday. Does that sound like a good progression / sensible date? I don't want it to feel very intense, but I obviously do want her to have fun and do something interesting!\n\nThanks for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

We were on and off for most of our senior year; but mostly on. We were fools in love. Told each other how we'd never find anyone else and how we were going to get married. We talked about everything from what our kids were going to look like to where our wedding was going to be. Sounds a little crazy right? Well it is. We didn't think so because both sets of grandparents (mine and hers) were high school sweethearts. So it was destined to happen for us right? Not looking like it now. I don't know how to deal. I moved away from college and we agreed to wait until I came back for break to reassess our situation. She then called me about a month and a half in to our being apart to tell me she slept with one of my friends and how bad she felt. I got over it. Now, she tells me just the other day that she has a thing with someone else and she kissed him and what not. I go home in 12 days and I'm terrified to face her. I'm still so in love with her and it kills me because she can move on and I can't.

I've liked this girl for years. Been best friends since we met. we'll call her X. We dated a couple years ago but we broke up and I tried to let go. Didn't work. A couple months ago we got back together, both changed people. She's the first person I've met that could make me feel really safe. So of course I fall in love, we do things, I take her virginity, she falls in love, she gives me her heart and soul and I give her mine. Keep in mind we're in highschool. Now to the FU. A friend of mine messaged me in class and told me she had feelings for me, and she's semi unstable at the time. So to avoid making a scene in class, I hint to her I have very very slight feelings for her too. I didn't mean it, I lied, I felt like garbage but I couldn't take it back. I did it just to get her off my back. But my girlfriend started going through my phone and told her about it, couldn't show her the texts because I had deleted them to try and forget that Y had existed. Well. X went ballistic, kind of understandably, and left me. Spent 2 hours screaming at me, me trying to fix it and failing. Had to wrestle a pencil and a razor away from her, it tore her up so much. She told me to get out of her house at first, then I volunteered to get out of her house and her life, she told me to stay until my ride got there. I'm still in love with X, she doesn't trust me but I'm not sure how she feels, I completely understand where she's coming from, and I feel empty. TIReallyFu. I ruined the girl I love.\nTL;DR:"}

She has also added that if she \"relented,\" then she fears the relationship would be too much based on the physical side. That makes it really hard for me since I am ready, but I know it would be a jerk of me to try to push her. I brought up intimacy without intercourse, and the farthest that has gone is almost fingering.

I agreed that it's not fair for us to do anything sexual if she's not comfortable.\n\nIt's just really hard because when we hang out, we usually make out, cuddle, straddle, etc and it's just too tempting to take it further. I know it isn't fair for me to try to pressure her into sex (like I said I'm fine with no intercourse, just talking oral/manual stimulation). I feel like a relationship without sex is just a close friendship, and although I really like being with her, sex is important to me.

We both lived in the same city, I'm going to college in the city, she went off to private university. She's back in town from the 12th to the 21st and texted me personally asking to see me. Now, when we were together, we had a very unbalanced relationship, meaning that she was very unhealthily attached to me, and I was distant from her. Upon retrospect I feel we should've stayed friends, but that's irrelevant.\n\nThe point is that I don't think she's over it based on the few conversations I've had with her since our breakup. Plus, if I know anything from my years as her friend and then as her SO, it's that she doesn't get over things easily and is emotionally attached to every guy she dates. How do I handle this situation? I'm feeling like I should try to avoid seeing her (we've been split up for about 1.5 months), but I don't know how to do it without sounding like a total ass. Should I just not worry about it and be blunt?\n\nThe **LAST** thing I want is to leave the door open for her to come back thinking she's got some chance at getting me back, because on my end, that ship has long since sailed.\nTL;DR:"}

We are that couple that literally finished the others sentence. I was interested in living with her and looked up online to see if it was a good idea. \n\nOver the summer she basically lived with me and slept over at my place for literally two months straight so I feel like we could do this, but I'm not sure if it's too early or if we are to young to be making a decision like this. She really wants me to and even her parents say it's a good idea for us when she comes back for good. I guess  basically what I'm asking is for an opinion if it's a good idea and some suggestions or tips to making it work out for the best.\nTL;DR:"}

Last summer I interned here in Seattle and we got our first taste of a long distance relationship. And it was surprisingly easy. We talked almost every night and there were maybe one or two \"oh my god I miss you too much\" instances that quickly faded. I think it was because we knew I was coming back for a whole year after the summer was over. \n\nThis summer she came out to Seattle with me and we lived together in an apartment for the first time.

We did well, and I didn't want it to end. \n\nBut sadly, she still has two years of school left. Just this morning she flew back to Milwaukee for her fall semester. We likely won't see each other until Thanksgiving (3 and a half months from now). Meanwhile, I am living alone, and I have very little to no friends out here. \n\nIt feels nothing like last summer. The loneliness is crushing and this apartment is ours, so the whole thing is a reminder of our incredible time together here. I finally understand the feeling of \"having a huge hole in your heart\".

I'm still trying to be a proper regular guy.\n\nIn the last three weeks I rented a car and got my driver's license. I think the woman doing the test may have given me a bit of leeway, but I appreciate it nonetheless. \n\nSo now I can drive. I don't have my own car, but I can generally use my parents' since they're of poor health and not so mobile, so long as they say it's okay. I went around my small town trying to find a simple job like I had when I was younger that my parents made me quit.\n\nI've wanted to do law enforcement since I was a kid, but I don't think that dream will work due to my myriad of issues, but I'm basically only living on hope right now. I was in school for it at university, but I got \"asked to leave\".

And 4) There's been some mom/dad/sister drama in the past couple of months that's been stressing me out (that may end up in a whole separate post itself).\nI've been taking this out on her a bit lately, which I feel badly about, so I'm trying to think of a way to make it up to her. She's into video games, but she's also pretty girly (yes, I know the two aren't mutually exclusive, but I figured I'd include it). Feel free to comment with questions.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My (f/20) best friend (f/21) of 14 years is ditching me on my birthday because her boyfriend (m/20) can't come.\nPOST: Hi Reddit.\n\nMy best friend of 14 years has been dating a horrible man. This man is extremely homophobic, possessive, has anger issues and has the most entitled, selfish way of thinking. Recently I made it clear to my friend that her boyfriend was not welcome in group plans (with the rest of our friends) because many of our friends in the group are homosexual and found his actions and words to them threatening. A few days later, my best friend told me she wouldn't be able to show up to my birthday party if her boyfriend couldn't come because she didn't want to put herself in a situation where there would be drunk single guys.\n\nThis really hurt me. I explained to her that I valued having the people closest to me with me during my birthday, and that it would really hurt me if she were to miss it. I also explained that I understood she was uncomfortable - however she was an independent woman who could take care of and defend herself, especially when all of her friends were around her for support and protection. I mentioned that although I had always hated her boyfriend that I always welcomed him with open arms and was incredible polite because I knew she valued him and I wanted to respect her and make her happy. The only time I did not welcome him is when he threatened to hurt my homosexual friends.\n\nShe listened to me, but she isn't budging on her decision. She thinks I'm being a drama queen and thats it's only one day and I will have a bunch of other people around me. She doesn't understand that having HER there is important to me and that its what I value. Maybe I'm not understanding what she values (not putting herself in that situation) at the same time...\n\nI don't know what to do. I can't look past this. I want to look past it so I can continue being her friend though. I don't want to lose her but I'm so hurt at the same time.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't want to start anti-depressants without consulting a doctor, etc. 2. Efexor is prescribed for major depressive disorders, and I would say my depression is only moderate\ni know i should just suck it up and go to a doctor and get actual medication prescribed for me if it's actually this disruptive, but obviously i don't have access to this immediately and possibly for the near future.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Possible link between stress levels and pubic hair on urinals?\nPOST: Something I have been observant of over the last few years, mostly because I have been in charge of keeping public restrooms clean, is the number of pubic hair on the edge of toilet seats (specifically in men's restrooms on urinals.) \nThe number of hairs on urinals tends to vary based on location of the restroom. From my observations I have noticed that places where people might be experiencing higher stress level, have more hairs on the urinals. Universities, work places, and gas stations/pit stops seem to have more hair on the toilets than places people go to relax or have fun (such as amusement parks, home environments, and the water park I have worked at for six summers now.) \n**My theory is that when men are stressed or tense, they scratch their scrotum more vigorously while they urinate than if they were at home or somewhere fun and relaxing.** This vigorous scratching would cause pubic hair to be pulled out and to fall on the edge of the urinal. Factors to take into account would be how busy a specific restroom/urinal is, how often the restroom is thoroughly cleaned, age of the toilet users, etc.\nDo you redditors think this theory is accurate?

Up until a couple months ago, whenever both of us got together, we would always have an incredible sex life. We always felt the need to do it as much as possible since its very rare for us to do it because of our distance. Both of us would initiate it, and before she would be very very in to it. She'd talk dirty, send dirty texts etc. and always start things up and ask about doing it.\n\n---\n\nHowever, these past couple months we have both made trips to see each other, but everytime we are alone, its always been me who tries to initiate it or ask if she would like to do it. She has been giving me some excuses here and there like she was tired or she's had a long day etc. It gets very worrisome for me to experience a 180 degree turn like this with my girlfriend. She never used to be this way and I am starting to feel insecure. When I try to talk about it with her, I just feel like some fiend who is addicted to this, but I just love us using these opportunities when they come because I really am in love with her. When I brought it up today with her she just said I have been pressuring her too much and because of that, things have changed a lot between us.\n\n---\n\nI just want for us to be the same way we were.

It was a long-distance relationship when she was at school out of state. Long story short she broke up with me out of the blue in a very messy way, I didn't handle it well and we both just argued with each other until we stopped talking. It's been two years since we've talked. The breakup/love thing doesn't matter to me, I am not looking to get back together with her. I do however regret the way we both handled things and losing my best friend. It's something that bothers me a lot, even when I didn't want to talk to her, it felt awful. I'd like to open up a bit of communication with her again, but I don't know how, or what to say. It is really important to me though, as she really was the best friend I've ever had, and I really miss them. \n\nI had some family issues for most of the time we were friends, which delayed me being able to head off to college myself, it was a pretty crappy situation. I finally got everything straightened out where I am able to go back to school and a whole bunch of other things that are going the way they should again. I want to let her know that, as when we decided we couldn't handle talking anymore, one of the last things she said was hoping I can get out of that situation. But I don't want to be like \"yo btw, school get! woohoo seeya!\" and then go back to not talking.\nTL;DR:"}

What now?\nPOST: Hello!\n\nIm sorry if this isn't the appropriate subreddit to be doing this. But I am extremely anxious and nervous and didn't expect this to happen so soon.\n\nBasically I started a satirical youtube account a few weeks back. Now I know that that was a risk in itself, knowing how the internet has the potential to be toxic, but I made sure to put a disclaimer on my descriptions so that I am not misunderstood and made sure all the jokes were light-hearted.\n\nIt was mostly all in good fun just for a few laughs and I did meet with a little bit of success for the short time, getting about 150 subs and one of my videos reaching 5000 views or so (the rest are somewhere between 50 and 300), with mostly positive comments on youtube itself.\n\nAnyway, I was informed that a facebook group took my video and has thousands of views. Whenever I went to check, not only was it true, but there is no indication that its a satire, and people are taking me seriously.\n\nI am extremely scared of this backfiring on me and do not know what to do.\n\nFacebook's system to file a complaint, is very complicated, I watched some on it videos and everything. I also have to fill out a form with my name and all, which I would rather not (sorry if this is too paranoid).\n\nI thought of making a facebook account/page for my youtube personna, and going there and just saying it, but I really am terrified. Mind you, this has also been a week or so since its been posted, so it may be too late for this damage control.\n\nI don't what I was expecting, I should've known better than making youtube videos no matter how fun I thought it would've been at the time...\n\nHas anyone else ever been through this? Is there anything else I could do?\n\nThank you very much for your time.\nTL;DR:"}

Mixed signals?\nPOST: Hey /r/relationships, thanks for taking the time to read this.  I'm in a tricky situation where I've hung out and slept with this girl twice, but she doesn't seem interested.  A big signal was when I kissed her goodbye after staying the night at her place.  I landed it, but she didn't contribute to the actual kiss.\n\nI'm keeping my cool as to not show much interest, but I HAVE been making all the moves thus far and I would like something more to come out of this.  Either I'm missing extremely subtle hints, or she's not giving any.  No compliments, no dates, no real flirting.  We just go for runs, play sports, and if we wind up at her place at night, I initiate whatever goes on.\n\nI think most women don't sleep with a guy unless there's some attachment or chemistry, but she doesn't give me the impression that there is.  Maybe she's keeping me on the back burner, maybe she's just super subtle, or maybe she's easy to bed without any strings attached.\n\nHas anybody else run into this situation before?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Is it just me or is this slightly unfair?\nPOST: My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now. We're both juniors in high school (17 years old). So we've been together for a pretty long time. We both know know we're not ready for sex, and I don't expect that of her at all.\n\nHowever, I've gone to second and third base with her (rather immature terminology for saying I've basically gone all the way to performing oral). And of course, she enjoys it. However, she has yet to return the favor, meaning she hasn't performed oral, nor has she even really touched down there, other than a few occasions over my jeans. Now of course, I've never pressured her to do anything. And this is by no means a dealbreaker for our relationship. \n\nI've tried slowly getting her more comfortable, and she said she's curious to try things out, but she never makes any effort at all towards trying it out. Every time we make out, it's basically until she's orgasmed from whatever it is I'm doing, and then I'm left unsatisfied. \n\nAm I right to think this is kind of unfair? Or am I just being a jerk for thinking like this? \n\nLike I've said, I've never pressured her to do anything at all. And this isn't something that's going to break the relationship for me. I know we're young and there's no rush, and I do like her very much, but sometimes it just feels like I'm not getting any sexual satisfaction, and being a pubescent 17 year old, hormones definitely are acting up.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: (UK) I have at least 3 more years of university left and several thousand pounds saved. What should I do with it?\nPOST: **Background**: in the UK we get government ensured loans to pay for university tuition (\u00a39k/year). This loan behaves more like a 'graduate tax' than a real loan, insofar as it has essentially no effect on your credit score(s), they wont reposes your things if you don't have enough money to pay, and it's written off completely after a few decades. We also get additional loans and *grants* (which you never have to pay back) in proportion to your familie's income. So coming from a low-income background I get a lot. I also made the decision to stay at home to study so I pay no/very little rent or utility costs. \n\nI have at least 3 years left on my degree, which will include a year abroad. I'm obviously not using this money and despite living what was (in my opinion) a relatively spend-happy lifestyle last year I still retained most of it. I expect to spend even less this year. \n\nSo what do I do with it? I have an acceptable knowledge of finance for someone who doesn't study that area, but I obviously don't know enough to manage funds actively. On the other hand, the idea of just putting money in a high interest account seems like a poor return on investment (especially now the Santander 123 account has been axed, to much shock in the British press)(especially as most high interest accounts force you to not touch the money for a year). Also, given volatility in the pound post-Brexit referendum, I'm skeptical of even keeping the money in the UK.\nTL;DR:"}

For example, shortly after \"A\" and I started dating, \"H\" texted him. She has anxiety problems and has panic attacks if she's forced to stay in a house alone. Her parents (whom she lives with) were going out of town on a ten day vacation. She begged \"A\" to stay with her while they were gone. When \"A\" said no, she called him and started sobbing into the phone. \"A\" ended up agreeing to do it. All this happened while we were on one of our rare dates together.\n\nDuring this ten day period, \"H\" crawled into his bed multiple times, even after \"A\" told her \"no.\" She also tried to give him an expensive promise ring. When he refused, she flipped out. I mean, really flipped out - screaming, throwing things, slamming doors, cold shouldering him. Despite all this, \"A\" still stayed in the house until her parents returned. He didn't want her to have a panic attack if he left. \n\n\"H\" is still really involved in \"A's\" life. She's a part of his church community and friend circle, which he really values. \"A\" is also close friends with \"H's\" parents. I can't ask him to cut \"H\" out of his life. At the same time, I feel like \"H\" has been totally unreasonable and clingy. She recently announced that she's moving out on her own and I'm afraid she's going to try to manipulate \"A\" into living with her.\n\nI want to get more serious with \"A\", but I don't want to get involved while \"H\" is in the picture.

Last month she went out to a bar alone to meet up with some high school friends and I stayed in because I had work in the morning. I couldn't sleep though and called her around midnight and asked if she needed a ride home. She responded that she was fine and her friends were going to take her home. She seemed a little mad and I dropped it, figuring I was being an overbearing boyfriend. \n\nShe came home later that night and fell right asleep. We didn't see each other much for the next week which isn't\nunusual since our work schedules are opposites and we're both full time students. She acted distant towards me when we were together and stopped me whenever I tried to initiate anything sexual. I finally asked her what wrong and she admitted to me that the night she went out to the bars with her friends her ex boyfriend was there. \n\nI knew of this ex, she had had a very emotional relationship with him in the past and talked about him occasionally. She claimed that she didn't know he was going to be there that night but they had begun talking and ended up in his car. She says that she had kissed him and then he had forced himself on her and raped her. I believe her about this, I truly believe that \"no means no\" and that this isn't a case of consensual sex that is being called rape to justify cheating. I've accompanied her to meetings with psychiatrists and counselors and watched her tell her parents what happened. She seems truly regretful that it happened. She also does not want to go to the police, by the time she told me there was no physical evidence and she feels like a court case would be a waste of time. \n\nThroughout this whole ordeal I've been equal parts numb and furious. I hate that she let herself make out with an ex alone in a car. I don't know how she expected that to end. I don't blame her for being raped though, no one deserves that. I don't know if I can continue this relationship but I don't want to hurt her anymore when she's already so low.\nTL;DR:"}

During the first week of school I met these two girls who were roommates. Lets call them Sue and Debra. I really like Debra but I have no classes with her, so I hung out with Sue because I knew Sue and Debra hung out together. So now a few weeks into school I hang out with them on the regular. \n\nHere's where it gets weird. For the first week I didn't know Debra had a boyfriend. Now I do. I'm now their really good guy friend. The thing is I really do like them both as friends and I'm ok with this scenario, but now Debra thinks her boyfriend is going to break up with her. \n\nHere's the double weird part though (and the title). Debra just asked me, in the event that she breaks up with her boyfriend, \"Will you find me a hookup?\" \n\n:O\nGonna add I think Debra is ridiculously attractive and does not need my help anyways, she just wants to be safe. WTF DO I DO?!!?!?! I don't want to ruin our friendship, but like shes really pretty and nice and all this stuff. Its weird if I get her a hookup, but like if I... I don't even know.

I never did, at least none that weren't far away, so today I finally trekked to the campus bookstore and bought the textbook I needed.\n\nI walked into the store, guy's like, \"Hi, may I help you?\" I'm like, \"Yeah! I'm looking for a microeconomics textbook?\" I told him the author and he showed me the book. I picked it up and brought it to the checkout, and then I was distracted by finding out that one of my friends works there, so I didn't really pay attention to what I was buying.\n\nI put the book in my backpack and didn't look at it again until now, when I brought it up to my room to study from. That's when it dawned on me... I picked up the WRONG BOOK. I already have a copy of this EXACT textbook from my Intro to Microeconomics class last semester. What I actually needed to buy was the MACROeconomics textbook, which has a similar cover, is the same edition and is by the same author and publisher.\n\nI'm just hoping that I can return it. My macroeconomics class is at 8 AM tomorrow morning so I'm planning to go as soon as the bookstore opens (which is probably 8, so I'll be late to my class, but whatever really) and see if I can return the book. It's still in the plastic wrap, but I may not be able to since it has a code for an online thing within the packaging and books with e-learning materials can't always be returned, even if they haven't already been opened. :/ If I can't return it, I just paid $160 for something I don't even need.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm shocked and appalled at my dog.\nPOST: I've read a few posts on here about introducing dogs/food aggression but none really fit what I need answered so I'll just jump right into what happened.\n\nFirst off, I have an Australian Shepherd/Dingo mix named Taco, she is approx. 14 months old. My friends have a 3 year old female pitbull named Ally. Said friends have to get rid of Ally after having her for all 3 years of her doggy life (their daughter has autism and is also 3 yrs old) they simply feel that they cannot give her the time and attention that she deserves. Today, I brought Taco to meet Ally and everything was going well albeit the normal skepticism of 2 dogs meeting for the first time. Now I know you're all going to think awh man what an idiot but Allys food bowl was out (shouldn't of been, I know). Taco watched Ally eat a bit of her food then as soon as Ally was finished Taco decided she wanted a bite to eat aswell. Ally sat and watched Taco eat for about 30 seconds (she was totally layed back and cool about it) Ally then approached HER bowl to share/eat with Taco. They were cool for about 10 seconds and then Taco 360'd and attacked her. While breaking them up Taco bit my friend (accidentally) and drew blood all the while Ally was trying to retreat away from her. After that happened Ally ignored Taco (I feel like Taco was trying to apologize to her in a doggy way). I'm very upset and shocked at my dogs actions as she has been around many dogs and never ever ever showed food aggression or bit anyone. I really, really want to help my friends out and give this amazing pup Ally a loving home. I guess what I'm asking is if this sort of thing can be fixed and if so how can it be done?\nTL;DR:"}

Places like that. \n\nI know that people will think that I'll just arrive and start living off of welfare or whatever. But I have never once asked for government help for anything. I was homeless for several months once and the only time I ever used the shelter was to take a shower. I've never been on welfare or any government assisted housing program. I can fend for myself and just think that a fresh start might be what I need to get my life in gear. \n\nSo I want to move. I've pretty much decided that sometime in the next year or so, I'll do it. That should give me time to save up a little bit of money. I still want to go to school once I get there. Finish up my education and get a degree. How should I approach this? Should I start taking some classes here at home so that I can get some background? Am I just aiming too high?\nTL;DR:"}

Obviously being a 15 year old boy my hormones are having world war three in my body. I fapped 2-3 times daily and was finding more ways to make it thrilling. Well, during my endeavors to find the next best thrill, my parents informed me that we were taking a train ride to my grandparents house. This was the opportunity I had been waiting for; I got to planning. I devised a plan to start in my chair, but finish in the bathroom as to avoid a mess. Easy enough I told myself, but oh was I wrong. \nThe day finally came and we boarded the train to leave. As we get to our seats I begin examining how I would pull this off. It looked easy enough, the seats all faced the same way, which was unusual for trains but worked for my situation. Luckily the train was not very full so I had the two seat row to myself, save the people across the walking aisle to my left. I sat down and began my wait. At the time I had an Ipod Touch that I had loaded up with some good bits of porn. So about 45 minutes into the ride I got to it. I plugged up the headphones, pulled my jacket over my lap and started going at it. After a good 5-10 minutes of straight fapping I realized I needed to check my escape route (the bathroom) and see if it was clear. But to my chagrin it was occupied, and worse yet there were two other people waiting to get in. At this point I begin to panic as I have nowhere to blow my load in peace. Thinking quickly I take off my sock, dawn it on my member, and keep on going like a champ. As I finish up in what I thought was a glorious victory, I look to my left and notice the elderly couple laughing to themselves and taking quick peaks at me. Knowing this I quickly put my sock under my seat, put my shoe back on and pretend to watch videos on my Ipod the rest of the trip\nTL;DR:"}

We are currently around half way through it but it is just getting so hard on the both of us we just end up feeling miserable. \n\nShe moved off campus in January and then flew to Japan in March and will come back in August. We were able to visit each other twice before she flew to Japan, Valentines Day and my Birthday in March, but haven't visited each other since. We are both very much committed to each other and will be moving in together for our senior year come September, So neither of us are worried about us breaking up or anything like that.\n\nWe currently message each other every day or two and get a Skype call in around twice a week. I personally wish it was more often but she is busy between school work and touring around Tokyo. We are both currently feeling miserable (myself more than her) from just not being together and especially missing holding and comforting each other. On top of that, this long distance is making both of us have irrational fears about our future and crazy worst case scenarios that are practically impossible.   \n\nDue to time-zones and work schedules the only chances we have to Skype together are my morning/her evening and vice versa so any advice on things we could do in that kind of time window just to try and feel closer would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThe last thing on my mind is about whether I should visit her or not. We had both agreed before she left that I shouldn't mainly do to cost and that we could spend that money on more useful things together than just a weekend together.

I've met them a couple of times and there is just absolutely no connection between me and any of his friends.

I've really tried to connect with them several times, it just doesn't work out. I'm quite an introverted person and I find it quite difficult to meet new people, but I really tried my best to open up and show interest in them. I just feel really out of place whenever I'm with them. I feel like they would rather not have me there. His friends have already expressed several times that they think my boyfriend spends too much time with me and not enough time with them, so I feel like I'm only a burden to them when I'm there.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't seem to notice. This is partly because I always tell him I had an okay time after we've met his friends. I'm never too enthusiastic though, that seems unfair to him because it's not true. He has never asked me what I think of his friends, so I never told him I don't like them.\n\nHe has one of their birthday partys coming up and I'm not sure what to do. He has asked me to join him. I'd rather not go. Do I need to join him and go to the party and pretend like nothing is wrong, or do I need to be honest with him and tell him I'd rather not go? He knows I'm not a big party person, just not that it's also because I don't like his friends.\nAm I just being selfish for not wanting to go?\n\nPerhaps it's important to note that he has met my friends on several occasions, and he does seem to get along with them.

What should I do?\nPOST: Hello friends, I was hoping to get some advice on a current situation. For the past 4 months, I have fallen in love with someone I met in college. We both have seemed to really click and we both would usually spend almost every day together. Anyways, she tells me that she can't see herself with anyone. I can completely understand that, I'm willing to wait. \n\nHowever things got complicated. We both got drunk and she kissed me. The next day we didn't talk about it. She knows that I like her, but not to the extent. Talking to someone from that night that had a heart to heart with her.. she advised me to ask her out or write her a letter telling my feelings. \n\nWell I decide to ask her out. She instantly says to me \"you know I don't want a relationship right?\" I completely understand. I want it to be right. I am just trying to follow someones advice. I was hoping to make her happy. To take her out and to show her someone truly cares. Anyways, she says yes. But I feel like a fool.\n\nThat night I get completely drunk. She calls me during the night and I pour my heart out to her. I know I shouldn't have answered. Anyways, the past couple days haven't felt right. I tried apologizing but she didn't acknowledge it this morning, merely texted me to ask if I was ok. I truly feel horrible and feel like I ruined something that could be great because of one mistake. I really do everything I can for this girl and am always there for her.\n\nMy question is, how do I procede? Do I give her space? Or is there something I should do to show I truly regret what I've said? I feel as if she is giving me space so I can feel better. Yet I'd rather resolve things and make sure everything is ok.\n\nAnyways, there are obviously more details to this story that I'd gladly get into if anyone has any questions. I have tried to keep this as concise as possible (and this is also my first post to Reddit). I am hoping getting this out will make me feel better about the situation.

It scares me because it's not some problem with a broken part...it's complex.\n\n\"I have very little to offer you. I'm nice, of average intelligence, and mildly attractive...you're great.\"\n\nShe says she just can't understand why I want to be with her, or love her, and that the insecurity behind that is the root cause of our problems.\n\nI say this only because it's pertinent: on paper, she's 'right'. I know for example that she's insecure about the disparity in our looks. \n\n\"You're just better than me.\"\n\nAt the same time, we have something incredible and unique and special.

She remarried several years later to my father, and had four children with him. They are still happily together through thick and thin. \n\nWhen I told my parents that I was getting separated from my husband, he and I had decided that it was pretty much final, and I had moved out, split bank accounts, etc. I am pretty stable now, much faster than I thought I would be, and my husband and I are on great terms and are going on with our lives. My mother, however, refuses to believe that it's final. She encourages me to force my way back into his life and \"claim my place\" as his wife, etc. The idea of my being divorced is pretty abhorrent to her. \n\nHowever, she's not once asked me in the three months since I told her that we are separating, how I am doing, where I'm living now, am I feeling lost, la la la. Not once has she asked aside from a superficial, how are you doing today, how the HELL I am doing. \n\nI was even home for two weeks with her, and we had a lot of deep conversations. She's going through stuff, we discussed that a lot. But she never mentions my well-being, just rants about divorce being damaging, shameful, etc. \n\nI am getting on fine without her inquiries.

He's told me he has actively tried to talk to me more about his feelings, BUT IT REALLY JUST ISN'T ENOUGH.\n\nOR\n\n(I have major anxiety issues) if I'm having a panic attack he'll never really know what to say.

There have been times where he has rang the door bell late at night just to ding dong ditch his kid with us so he could go gamble. \n\nAll of this shit hit the fan friday after I called my mom; my uncle got in a fight with my mother, his brother, and cried the whole night at my house about his problems. This was a result of my other uncle telling timmy \" I hope you don't end up like your father when he grows up. Jerry flipped shit and went after my other uncle, who promptly threw him in a head lock and told him to leave. The worst, though, was realizing that my little cousin cried the whole way to my house after witnessing his dad and uncle fight. He screamed at his father \"You never do anything with me!!!

She would also go on to move out, but by mere chance we ended up moving into the same apartment complex (Life is so stupid sometimes).\n\nAnyway we didn't talk for the better part of a month. During that time I tried my best to first forgive myself, and move on. I had quite honestly the best month of my life, just being single and having fun. I met a few girls, but I really liked one (Blue). We've really hit it off and I'm finally at the point where I can see myself with another woman. I'm \"over\" Sky as much as you can be over your first love. It doesn't kill me to see her with another person (although shes told me she isn't interested in anybody else)\n\nSo here is the problem. Me and Sky are back messaging again. Its been a constant exchange of feelings and we're planning on taking a trip, as friends later next month. I don't know how she feels about me romantically, but I'm still at the very least attracted to her. She has always stated that we would have to start over as friends anyway. Me and Blue are talking about making the commitment and starting our own relationship. If I were to do that, then I would cut Sky out of my life completely since I'm already moved on for the most part. However, I'm not sure that I want to do that. I want to have one last heart to heart with Sky first, just to see how she feels. If she wants to try again I feel as though I would. However is she passes I'll cut her out forever.\nTL;DR:"}

They mentioned next stop was Canada, and we asked where in the U.S. they were going - they were not. None had been, but they felt they could get all the NorthAmerican culture they needed by seeing Toronto and Montreal, as \"American gave the world jazz and hamburgers and not much else - the country just refined lots of things ideas other countries your people came from invented\". Someone probably then made a dingo eating your baby joke. Awesome people, and maybe they just were giving us some shit, but, it got my friends and I thinking about the topic, as we encountered that point of view somewhat frequently. We came (somewhat drunkenly) to this list in around a minute:\n\n*jazz\n\n*the American Style Hamburger and french fries\n\n*Rock and Roll\n\n*The Internet\n\n*The modern telephone\n\n*Modern electrical systems powering homes and buildings\n\n*The transistor\n\n*The MRI\n\n*Hip-Hop/Rap\n\n*the electric guitar\n\nWe knew there were many more, and we realized too that there are many misconceptions of where food/arts/technologies really came from (i.e., one person invents the basic form, and a group in an other country gets credit because they made it mainstream, or perfected the idea).\nTL;DR:"}

I am in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend of almost a year, and she told me last night that she is becoming more tempted to cheat on me. Her justification was that she feels alone and lonely a lot when we are not physically together. We skype everyday and visit each other during summer/winter breaks, but I can't physically be with her permanently until I graduate college. Infidelity is something I do not tolerate, but she has not cheated on me yet, but after she told me this I am scared she might in the future. We have only been together for about a year, and we have 2 more years of college until we can be together. Is there any way I can help her feel more secure and less lonely during our time away from each other? Or is this a red flag that I should end the relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

I just graduated, and my mom's cousin - let's call her Carol, who is in her 60s, invited me in March to go on her family's vacation to Africa. Carol's family is very well-off, both her and her husband are successful and prominent lawyers. I am close with her children, my second cousins, and eagerly said I'd love to go. The trip begins in a week and a half.\n\nA couple months ago, Carol asked me to pay for my flights inside Africa. This was about $1k, and I sent her the money - a little surprised but ok with it since the trip looked amazing.\n\nThen last night, she asked me if I could send her a check for the rest of the trip. I asked how much. She then informed me that I owed her another $3,500. That's like 7 months rent for me, and I clearly don't have the money. There was never any mention of the price of the trip to me at any time.\n\nI was under the impression that when a family member from an older generation invites a younger family member who is a student on a family trip, that the costs of that trip would be covered - unless the costs were discussed beforehand. I guess not so much.\n\nSo after spending $1k on my flight from the USA to Africa, then another $1k on my flights within Africa - I had to tell her that I can't go and now I have a flight to South Africa next with absolutely no plans once I'm there. \n\nThanks fam.\nTL;DR:"}

Supposedly, I'm an intelligent person, but am by no means and intellectual, and the academic nature of university bores me to tears. \n\nAdditionally, it's likely that I have ADHD (according to a psychiatrist), and my work habits are awful.

However I've noticed that our sex life seems to be dwindling. I'd say it's been this way for about 3 months. I've had to initiate almost every time we have sex. Now I'm not opposed to me initiating but it seems that every time I do he responds with half of what I'm doing. It's like it's a chore. \n  \nHowever the times I'm able to put him in the mood or he initiates, the foreplay is severely lacking. He sticks to about three core moves and that's it. I've tried telling him I'd like more foreplay and to try to switch things up and he'll nod and say he'd be okay with that but it never happens. He's a redditor (mostly for his porn) so I told him I'd love it if he were to subscribe to r/sex to find some fun things (toys positions, etc.) that he'd like to try. He said \"I guess I could\" but it wasn't with much enthusiasm and I doubt he has due to the lack of suggestions. I've even asked him to show me some of his favorite porn clips/movies so I could see what he likes and he shrugs off the suggestion by saying he mostly just looks at pictures. \n\nThe lack of enthusiasm towards our sex life is making me self conscious and just plain sexually frustrated. Last night at a party I got pretty drunk with a girl friend. We started to dance and ended up calling all the other girls at the party over to dance, and in my drunken state I began to grind on another guy. I realized how getting some male attention felt really good. I then felt immediately guilty for seeking attention from some random guy. \n\nIt's gotten to this and I feel like I've tried communicating to him that I need more attention and that I am human and do have sexual needs as well.

It was my first real relationship. she was my second girlfriend ever. my first gf broke up with me after a week cause i was too \"awkward\". \n\nAlthough it was a toxic relationship. she was my best friend and my girlfriend all in one. we had our good moments. but our bad moments were awful. I would do so many great things for her. but her food on dates. suprise her with random things. although i wasnt rich, we went on nice little dates that were fun. \n\nin our last major fight. she flat out tells me that i never do anything nice for her and all of our dates are shitty. and how we never go out to eat at nice restaurants. thats what pushed me over the edge because im not rich but i always take her out on fun dates. and she is always talking about how she can do much better than me. (which i honestly think she wont be able to easily). \n\nIt just makes me sad that she has to be this dillusional about how good i treat her and my money situation. \n\nI learned so much about relationships and girls when i was her bf for this long. so i have that going for me. but Im not like the guys that girls want to be with.

She calls me after a few texts and then we end up talking for about an hour and a half. \n\nOk, this is the issue or question I have. At one point in the conversation, she became kind of weird and started to speak really softly. I don't know how the topic came up (we were kind of talking around our attraction to each other and past sexual experience), but she whispered very softly to me that she hadn't been on birth control in 8 years. I told her that I appreciate her telling me that, but it was her choice to be on birth control. I think the way she told me implied that she was guilty about it. \n\nI know some women don't like being on birth control. It affects them in weird ways. I'm just confused why she felt the need to tell me that. Is a woman NOT being on birth control a weird thing and/or is it something a woman could feel guilty for?\n\nAnyway, I also told her that I ALWAYS use a condom.

I kind of back tracked since he told me that, even though he treats me like his girlfriend and we are exclusive.\n\nWhat is it about the girlfriend label that bothers him? We are by all means in a monogamous relationship and I'm practically his only friend. I was sensing just last month that he was wanting to become more serious sooner than me. \n\nNow it feels like the tables have turned. I don't want to feel like he's trying to hide me from his family, at 6 months you should be able to at least tell them.\n\n Since then I've been having some resentment building up towards him. I send him passive aggressive texts occasionally that are blaming him a lot for not making me feel wanted. So that has been making him more distant from me. He doesn't text/call me first anymore like he use to just a few weeks ago.

One of the posters at a dog park was torn down the next day and I found that suspicious. Long story (kind of) short, my cousin and his friends go to that park very regularly and it never crossed my mind that he may have stolen it at the time.

(he's not allowed to come over ever again since he got caught stealing my shoes) I'm beggining to think he stole the bikes too.

No joke. I would rather be eaten by sharks than get poked by one of those needles. At the time, my mom was an RN so she was friends with the nurses there, which I believe were her friends from college. While she chatted I watched TV until about seven minutes later when my mom took me into the back where there was a chair waiting for me. \nThe nurse who drew blood from my wrist searched for a vein and found one. She told me \"Just hold still, okay?\" Then, she pulls out a motherf*cking LONG needle at which instanly I trembled and preceded to go apeshit in my chair. One nurse came to hold me down; not enough. Then, two nurses. STILL not enough. Three nurses. Then four, and then finally five nurses had held me down just to get one sample of blood from me.\n\nRemember that lactose-intolerance I mentioned earlier? Well, having a four cheese pizza the night before, as that needle inched closer, my bowels went lose and I shat my pants. **HARDCORE**. **SHAT**. **MY PANTS**.\n\nAs soon as the nurse was done drawing blood, the five nurses gave my mom the stinkeye as she pulled me out of the UC center. I tried to waddle along so the foul liquid didn't seep out of my pants. But a trail of brown followed me out the door. \nNeedless to say, my mom was fuming mad at me that day.

We were great together and I had never been happier until recently.\n\nOur conversations have been tapering off to practically nothing and my primary love language is quality time, which hasn't been getting fulfilled. I was fine with that until now.\n\nNow I have a new friend (let's call him Joe) and I can't help but get that crush feeling. He's not normally my type but he's cute and nice and since we have classes together I see him a lot.\n\nRecently Joe and I have started hanging out more and he's so easy to talk to and i can't help but smile when I talk to him. He's been getting a little flirtier with our conversations and his actions lately and actively seeking me out to talk to me which has been a nice change of pace from what I have with my boyfriend currently.\n\nI love my boyfriend, but sometimes when I'm in class, all I can think about is what dating Joe would be like.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [20F] ex boyfriend [22M] won't stop trying to communicate with me.\nPOST: I dated my ex for 2 years and fortunately had the good sense to break up with the abusive ass about 9 months. Post breakup he would not stop contacting me, even though I didn't want to talk. I was stupid at first and talked back, but stopped communicating at all several months ago. His attempts to contact me became less frequent, and I assumed he was done with it. The few messages I did get from him were always either apologizes or insults or attempts to tell me how good he's doing; basic bitter ex stuff. \n\nSo things were okay until I went on vacation with my family and my new wonderful boyfriend of 6 months. My mom posted pictures of the trip on Facebook, and my ex, who my mom forgot she was still friends with, saw them. He went bat shit crazy immediately. Started texting and demanding I give him back everything he ever gave me. I was happy to oblige but had my mom handle it (again, zero contact) since I'm away at college anyway. He continued to message me, so I blocked him on Facebook. He tried to friend request my new boyfriend, obviously just to piss him off. I had both my mom and boyfriend block him. So I thought that was over. \n\nWrong! Next he tried to add me on snapchat. I decline. Then he texts me. I block his number. He texts me from a different number. I block it. He texts me from another number. I block it again. He's incessantly trying to communicate with me. His messages are all pitifully immature, with him bragging about having sex with his awesome new gf (poor girl, I hope she figures out how unstable he is), telling me I'm fat, telling me how he's so much happier without me, yada yada. He has no control over me anymore and nothing he can say will hurt me, but I'm just so tired of him trying to contact me. Every time it's a reminder that I let this piece of shit abuse me and hold me back for two years. I'm sick of him. I want zero contact but he refuses to let that happen. Is there anything I can do here, or am I doomed to keep receiving messages and blocking them as I go?\nTL;DR:"}

However I was in the military so I would only see her when I would come home, 1-2 times a month as I was only stationed 3 hours away from home. Fast forward to today a lot has changed. I used to sent her a lot of cute messages, and was able to spend all day with her because of me being on leave/vacation and just overall having a lot of free time. \n\nNow I work roughly 30-35 hours a week and go to school full time Monday-Friday. I try to speak to her throughout the day but I get carried away with school and work as I deal with customers. So she feels neglected and telling me I've changed. I know it is much different than it used to be for sure, but with my schedule I am now I'm mentally and psychically drained. On my off days I try to do my homework first and then hang out with her. So usually we don't spend much time on my off days either due to the fact that she also goes to school. \n\nSo what should I do? I mean we've talked about it and she told me pretty much she feels neglected and I've asked for less hours at work to spend more time with her. I mean I don't think I'm the bad guy here for trying to improve my life, but I know where she's coming from I just have no clue how to handle this situation at all. Any advice?!\nTL;DR:"}

Apparently granny needed to pee and I was just in time to see granny pull away her blankets and sitting up on her bed.

Everyone embarrassed except for granny who just moves on to the bathroom.\n\nRest of the family gathering was pretty quiet. We stayed like another half an hour staring awkwardly at each other.

I didn't get any interviews.\n\nSo eventually, I just took a entry level job, at a company I liked (a small/medium sized ~1,000 employee financial) - answering phones for customer service. One of the questions I asked in my interview was \"Are there opportunities to move to other departments within the company, once you've taken a job like this?\" I was told \"Yes, probably 1/3 of the people who work in positions that aren't highly specialized started on the phones.\"\n\nI worked the phones for about 5 months, when an email came through from my manager - they were doing a rotation on the web team, any internal employees could submit a resume to spend 3 months working as a \"User Experience Analyst\" (at your current customer service salary) with the option to be hired full time, if they liked you.\n\nI got the rotation, worked my butt off for 3 months, and ended up with the \"entry level\" job I had been wanting from the start.\nTL;DR:"}

We live together in a place we rent and are saving for a home deposit so we can buy a place to live after university. \n\nHe hates his smile. I think it is beautiful and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Sure, it's not perfectly straight, but everyone's teeth are a little crooked. He wants to get braces, and I am opposed to this on a few fronts.\n\n1) He doesn't need them. This is a purely aesthetic and selfish decision. For some reason getting braces is seen as a lot more socially acceptable than plastic surgery, but it boils down to the same motivation: aesthetics. \n\n2) This will cost him anywhere between 5,000-10,000. This is a lot of money to spend on something that is purely the way you look. We are meant to be saving for a house deposit (40,000 at the very least). Due to a scholarship, we can save about 28,000 but will still need to find the difference. If we are losing 10,000 to braces, I find this to be a very selfish decision. \n\n3) This is probably the most frowned upon aspect, but this is the way I feel. He will be an adult with braces. Again, his teeth aren't even bad. And quite frankly, I don't want to have a partner who can't make out with me before sex because his lips are sore against his braces. That hardly turns me on. And also, I'll feel like I'm looking at a pre-teen. Unfortunately, that's just how I feel about it. \n\nSo what do you think reddit? Am I being unreasonable? Or do I have some valid points that he should be considering before going through with this drastic and unnecessary procedure.\nTL;DR:"}

I had been ridiculously stoned and it was the late showing. When I began driving home it was way past midnight (still with the N on my license). I turned onto my street (which is actually a main highway with houses) and not twenty feet before my driveway are three police vehicles stopping cars. I start freaking out. I get stopped, and an older male cop comes up to the window and asks to see my license. I search frantically for it while subtly covering up my weed, sitting in the passenger seat, and I can't find my license. It's nowhere in the car. He asks me to pull off to the side and continue searching. It dawns on me: it's still with my passport. I had been travelling and just got home that day and forgot to put all my identification back in my purse. The cop comes over, and I begin by telling him, quite sincerely, about my mistake. But then I launch into hysterics: \"Is everything okay officer? It's just, you guys are right in front of my house and you really scared me. I thought something terrible had happened to my family when I rounded the corner! I'm sorry, it just really freaked me out, officer.\" I almost start crying, letting all my nerves out to try and get some leeway. He was really apologetic, telling me that they were only looking for suspended drivers and that nothing was the matter, but that he was really sorry for scaring me. He told me to get on home, champ, and get that license back in my wallet. He even asked me how Harry Potter was.\nAbout eight months later I found out my license had been suspended for speeding a year and a half ago, and that is how long I had been driving without a valid license.\nNeedless to say I was shaking when I got in my driveway, and am now the proud owner of a valid license that never leaves my wallet.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong, for example, one of the girls said we were moving too fast (slept with each other in a week) and then this most recent girl I met off OkCupid said we weren't moving fast enough and she had no connection with me (which was a complete newsflash to me).\n\nI can't decide if this is me or whether its the girls. Perpetually, I seem to meet a girl, hang out a few times and then it just fizzles away. I wonder if its because I don't escalate quicker or am just a boring prude who doesn't communicate properly. This last girl from OKC just texted me unceremoniously and said it was off which made me respond \"ok, just leave me alone\". Is this indicative of why I can't seem to ever get past just casual hookups and meaningless excessive texting? I feel like every girl that I meet up with has some reason that she can't eventually commit. I mainly assume its something I've done and my weird ways just freaks them out and sends them running.

This is even though I told him I wanted to see him, and the friends house is this guy he's been spending lots of time with lately.\n\nWe got into an argument over it all and then he sent me a text after we sorted things out saying he was going to the pub with the friend and that he was leaving his phone at the friends house because thats what his friend did? He said he'd text in an hour and its almost been two hours now..\n\nWhat's more is he *knows* I don't like him going to the pub and he *promised* he'd always text me when he was at one. This was less than a week ago that he said that. And I went on his emails (which hes fine with) and he's somehow checked his emails while he's \"been out\"? \n\nWe've been through a lot together, and last night I kinda poured my heart out about some things I haven't told anyone before.. But I feel kinda cheated.. He knows I hate liars and he's making it so I just can't trust him.\n\nAnd some might say its only been an hour, but this is someone who ALWAYS texts me, constantly usually.\nTL;DR:"}

Now, nearing graduation we've been going out on dates and hanging out. This has been for about 8 months. For the most part, it wasn't romantic until last week when it rekindled. We have always been very open and honest with each other and she says she trusts me and says I've done everything right and that there's nothing I was doing wrong, but even though she has feelings for me and likes me, she says she doesn't know if there's enough there, and she just wants to be friends for a bit longer to figure things out. \n\nDo I at this point no longer try to kiss her when we hang out, do I avoid heavy flirting? I'm just so lost with this. She says she sees me as a friend, but that she doesn't mean it can't be more eventually. In most cases with almost all girls, I would chalk this up to her teasing me and trying to make me that safety net that's always there, but I've known her far too long and she isn't that kind of person. \n\nI don't want to lose her again. I messed up once, but this time I know what I want, and it's her. She also hates texting, so we only ever talk by phone or in person, but I don't know if I should start calling her more often or what... She went from literally last week saying that she wanted me to come over and bring wine and she would cook us dinner to me just meeting her at a skating rink and going skating. I have no idea what could have happened in less than a week when the last time we went out she said she wanted to really start things and now shes says she wants to slow things down.

It's been a tumultuous relationship to say the least, with him having made some questionable decisions regarding other women early in the relationship. However, I decided to forgive him and move on, and things have been pretty great since we worked out our issues.\n\nThough I am able to forgive his mistakes, I still find it incredibly hard to trust him, and he doesn't really make things easier. I don't believe he's cheating on me, but he just acts really shady sometimes.\n\nHere's the issue: we're about to be separated for the better part of 3 months for our college summer break. We'll be on opposite sides of the country, and currently don't have plans to visit each other. I am incredibly worried about how my trust issues are going to affect our relationship while we're apart. If I can't trust what he says he's doing when he's a mile away, I know I'm going to drive myself crazy this whole summer.\n\nI am strongly considering asking him to take a break in the relationship while we're separated- less consistent contact, allowed to see other people, etc. My logic is that if we're not officially \"together\", I know that I won't get as upset as I do now regarding what he does. \n\nMy questions: does this seem logical? I feel like a break would give me time to level myself out, clear my head etc, but I don't want him to take this as me breaking up with him, because i'd love to pick back up in the fall. Should I go through with this? What would be the smoothest way to propose this idea?\nTL;DR:"}

Estimate given by the office before the work was $400.\n\nWhile I was in the chair, dentist tells me he can't do the fillings the standard way and tells me he will have to send the work to the lab to create a filling. I ask about price while in the chair with my two teeth drilled out, he says, \"I can't say, but it should not be that much more.\"\n\nFeeling I have little choice, I reluctantly agree and he finishes the work, sending fillings to the lab to complete. \n\nI later get a bill for $1,800. On top of this unexpected cost, the secretary also tells me she estimated wrong on what my insurance would cover (she originally said $500) and it will cover nothing. I argue with her multiple times and the office eventually agrees to give me $250 off. However, I am stuck on a payment plan for the next two years paying for something that I believed would have been completely covered by my insurance when I entered the dentist office on the day of work. \n\nI realize I am partly at fault for not checking for more information or demanding a price before the lab work, but I feel a little scammed here. Yes, my teeth are saved and that is worth something. I can hardly afford the bill and wonder what will happen if I have another unexpected medical expense, as all my extra money is going toward this expense. This happened in Michigan, if that is a factor for anyone answering. \n\nIs there anything I can do to resolve this situation and pay a more reasonable cost?\n\nThanks for any answers.\nTL;DR:"}

I kept saying okay we can stop until marriage, but give it like a week or two and she initiate it, I'd ask are you sure? And we went through with it.\n\nWell fast forward to about 4 months ago, she thinks its best if we go on a break to focus on our faith, so then we can have a more Godly relationship. I thought that was a bad idea and we can work on that and still be together but we didn't. We would talk and see each other occasionally. Last night at 10 she texts me to come over to talk. When I get there we don't talk, she wants to go to sleep and have me spoon with her. She just said she missed me and wanted me there.\n\nIn the morning she leaves early for work. And I know this part is shady and wrong, but something doesn't feel right so I check her facebook. (Rewind, before she announces this \"break\" she told me a male friend of hers kissed her, and she kissed him back, but it didn't mean anything and that she was sorry. I forgave her, but she kept hanging out with this guy, so I had concerns) I pull up her conversations with him to find out that, they had sex together and hang out all the time. There were many messages that were like \"I wish you were here\" or \"come over.\" So I am freaking out, I call her at work, said we need to talk. Ask her repeatedly for the 100% truth of what happened with her and this guy during the break. She said they kissed a couple time, but they aren't together, and that she doesn't have feelings for him. I don't know what hurts worse the lies or the cheating or the hypocrisy.

Here's the sequence of events:\n\nI come off from an on-ramp and need to merge onto the interstate before I am out of road (plus it's rude to wait to the last second). The lane next to me is open with a car a few lengths ahead, and a blue car back about 10 car-lengths. I signal to merge for a few seconds, and then commit into the lane. Half-way through the blue car 10 lengths back speeds up and is practically on my bumper before I finish merging; honking his horn several times and flipping me off. This pisses me off so I flip him off and honk my horn.\n\nShortly after that he merges to the next lane over, drives parallel with me, still flipping me off. He then moves on, riding the bumper of the car in front of them. Through the commute I see him again by recognizing the car and license, so I memorize it.\n\nNow it seems kind of petty because there wasn't any accident, and I did honk and flip him off back; but should I do anything with this information?\nTL;DR:"}

She has always been confident we will be fine and all will turn out well in the long run. This is actually my first relationship.\n\nNow on Friday evening, she had been out with some friends and came back to her place, we were talking on whatsapp. Whilst she was home, she told me herself, her sister, her sisters dude and her sisters boss were all chilling together. For some reason, I lost my temper and broke up with her, I think due to the set up 2 guys 2 girls, for some reason my mind convinced me that something would happen, even though this is a completely ridiculous thought as she is a very loyal person.\n\nWe spoke yesterday, and she has stated that she loves me and wants us to be together, however she needs some space to \"think and feel what she feels inside without having to talk to me a lot\". I am happy to give her some time and space, and believe we actually need it as things have become really tense recently. Do you guys think I have completely messed it up, or is there still hope for us?

During that time, our relationship was defined by furious, Game of Thrones-esque mind games and consistently trying to fuck each other over. I'm bisexual and have slept with other girls but stopped around the beginning of this year. He has slept with one other girl since hooking up with me. We have both made out with numerous other people. Needless to say, it was a goddamn mess as we were both being pulled back and forth on the emotional spectrum as we toyed with each other relentlessly. Eventually, after two intense falling outs in which we thought we were done with the relationship, we suddenly became\u2026 normal. And then one day after a few months of this peace, he asked me to date him. Surprised but we agreed to try it out although it was tough to get out of that FWB mind-set so we still occasionally tried to \"out alpha\" each other. About two weeks in, he kissed some random girl at a club. Apologised to me about it in the morning and we had a very long, very stressful fight in which he accepted full responsibility for his actions but stated that they were a result of my having neglected him and pushed him into the background. I did admit to some of these charges but I maintain that he should have spoken to me about it instead of acting out because we are trying to move away from that previous, f*cked up arrangement.\n\nSo my question to you, Reddit, is what do?

I'll never forget how much it hurt my scalp when she shampoo'd our hair because she would scratch her nails into our scalp when lathering our hair. It hurt BAD and never understood why she did that.\n\nFast forward 20+ years later (now, being 29 years old.) I've picked up her method ever since and have always cleaned my scalp just as hard while shampooing - essentially stimulating my scalp and cleaning the pores from which my hair comes from every time I shower, as I always have.\n\nI look in the mirror the past two weeks and find that my hair is thinning out. Not too bad. But today was the straw that broke the camels back - a bald spot that I can barely hide by combing my other hair over it is becoming very noticeable. And Im able to pull out 2-3 strands of hair by just pinching with my thumb and pointing finger. Either something is really wrong with me inside and I'm really sick, or I'm starting to bald early. Mind you I have a lot of stress from work, I barely have time to exercise in my schedule and I recently quit smoking cigarettes after 5+ years.\n\nI immediately Google hair loss for young men and read everything I possibly can. I'm so deep into my anxiety and grief at this point that I go straight to researching which Rogaine works best - just as a temporary fix if anything, because I can't stand knowing that I am losing hair this fast and this young, with this noticeable balding under my combed hair. \n\nI do further research, and I find out that I've been unknowingly wrecking my scalp the past few years. Not only have I been washing my hair WITHOUT conditioner..  I've been using Selsun Blue (medicated version that has menthol) EVERY. DAMN. SHOWER.. thinking I was doing my scalp and hair a favor by washing aggressively with what I thought would be the best/healthiest product for my hair. My scalp has probably endured the equivalent of shaving without aftershave x100 these past few years, and it finally showed symptoms many years later.\nTL;DR:"}

I am over him and I want to come over as mature, but when I'll act all happy and polite towards him, I'm afraid he'll think I still love him, like I'm thinking \"HEY YES IT'S YOU AGAIN!!!\". \nBut when I'll act distant he may think I still feel hatred towards him for breaking up with me.

I told him to stop being creepy and to just talk to them, like a normal human being. He responded with \"I don't know how to talk to girls.\" So, me, being the great friend I am, decided to give him some horrible pickup lines. They kept getting worse and worse as I listed so many out, that he started to walk much faster in front of me to get away from me. Of course, it was when he was a few feet ahead of me that I started shouting the pickup lines to him, and that was, of course, when a little girl (probably around 10-12) and her (mother, grandmother, something) walk out of the store right between me and my friend, as I had yelled \"AYOOO GURRRRL, YOU LIKE KARATE? CUZ I'D KICK IT WITH YOU!\"  \nThat was when the small child and grandmother looked in my direction....the child had a look of pure confusion, probably because the child has no idea what \"kicking it with you\" means because I'm old and my slang is old, and the grandmother gave me a glare of absolute hatred and disgust.  \nMy friends, of course, observing this all happen, then the look of horror on my face, started cracking up. So, I ran towards my friends and said \"OH MY GOD I THINK THEY THOUGHT  I WAS TALKING TO THEM.\" as I turned red, and hoped to god they heard that statement, too...but I didn't turn around to find out. My friend pointed out that the way I said \"AYO GURL\" also sounded like \"Hey little girl\" which made it way creepier. I truly hope that they realized I was just joking around with some friends, because if not, I'm probably on a list somewhere now.\nTL;DR:"}

This is partially because I'm shy, but mostly because I've always been extremely busy and (insert other excuses here).\nAnyway, on to my real problem. I've always been the nice guy. Even to the point of helping my best friend hook up with my crush because he asked me to. I try to always make decisions that affect the people around me the least. So there's this girl a grade below me (11) that I have liked for a good while now, who was dating a friend for a while. They broke up near the end of last year, and I told myself I'd wait until after the summer out of respect for him to ask her out (I know, self excuses). \nTurns out at the end of the summer she was hanging out a lot with this other guy. Let's call him Chad because who likes a Chad right? Now, Chad is generally not a well-liked person. He's frankly annoying and doesn't have a proper grasp on social protocol. \nI spend a fair amount of time with this girl, and the signs she sends me (base on a lot of wiki reading) seem to be that she likes me. I asked Chad, and he said they are dating, but I want to ask her out anyway. Is that wrong? I think I'm better for her, and I think that she would be happier with me, which is what really matters to me, but I don't want to ruin the almost closeish relationship we have now. \nHonestly, I'm not even afraid of being friend zoned because I'm so lonely that even a close friend would make me happy, although it's very possible I would feel differently if that occurred.\nSorry for making this so long, I just want to help you understand so you can help me.\nTL;DR:"}

The shelter told me she can become aggressive when it comes to guarding things like toys and water but nothing about randomly attacking other dogs. When I brought her home she showed none of that at an off leash park or on walks. She would play and wrestle at the park without problems no matter the size. On walks she would get excited to see another dog and sniff around like a normal dog.\n\nAbout a month ago she started acting different. When she is on a leash and sees another dog she will (about half the time) snap at it right away instead of the normal sniffing introduction. At the park she still plays with most dogs but will start fighting every once in a while (usually about 10 seconds into playing with a bigger dog), when she does this I scoop her up and take her away.\n\nThe only thing that seemed to change at that time was that she was on antibiotic eye drops that had steroids but those have been done for a few weeks (i have little background in pharmacology but I don't know if steroid eye drops can have that much behavioral effect and if it does it should have subsided by now).\n\nI want to treat this correctly because spending the rest of her life separated from other dogs is downright lonely for her and sad for me.

Notwithstanding, this guy is incredibly down-to-earth and we ended up getting along really well, as if we've been old friends. Thanks to my mousy female co-lawyer who'd rather stay in her hotel room after work, John and I were left alone in the evening to just hang out over drinks. Being incredibly intelligent and having lived all over the world, this guy blew my mind. He's so intellectually stimulating but at the same time, we laugh at the same stupid jokes, and I think these two things are what made me attracted to him. Nothing physical happened during the trip, though.\n\nFast forward to today, when we're both back to our respective cities, we're still exchanging e-mails: what's happening in our lives lately, photos, jokes, etc. I like him for sure, but I'm not entirely certain if he likes me back or if he's just being friendly.\n\nApart from the he-likes-me-he-likes-me-not guessing game, I'm also brooding about how John is in the position of giving me the opportunity of joining his firm.

I didnt know anything about the checks I was getting until 2014. I notified the VA that I hadnt recieved a check for 6000. The VA told me that I had received that check, and they furnished a copy of it to me. They copy didnt have my signature. I got the feeling the VA didn't believe my story, and told me that it could take years to find and reimburse my check. This week I got a letter from a local back, announcing that I had unclaimed funds sitting there and I needed to withdraw it or it would go away. Turns out, whoever stole my check, opened a bank account with my name, and deposited the check into that account. They left 1600, which the bank is now insisting I withdraw. I feel that if I withdraw that money, that I would lose the rest of what was stolen. Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been in relationships where men have used me for sex/money/to fill their time and then kicked me to the curb when they've gotten whatever they want out of me.  I've had emotionally abusive relationships where my SO at the time has put me down, called me derogatory terms, manipulated me into believing things were my fault, etc, etc, the list goes on.\n\nMy current SO is generally wonderful, we've been together for a year, and he treats me better than any man ever has.  However, there are times when we'll get into an argument/heated discussion, or I'll do something, that will cause him to speak to me in a derogatory way.  He'll call me crazy, ridiculous, terrible, etc.\n\nEven if there are times when he's being sarcastic or using a joking tone, my history with men using those words towards me makes his use of them cut deep.  There are emotional scars and wounds I have that may never fully heal.  Every time I try to tell him that I'm not ok with him using those words towards me, he'll tell me that I am overreacting and that I need to chill out.\n\nI don't think I'm going too far when I say that I'm not ok with being talked to that way.  I will **never**, *ever* be ok with a man calling me crazy.  How do I help him understand that being treated that way, regardless of intention, will never be something I'm alright with?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Will I ever be happy, Reddit?\nPOST: This is a throwaway account. So here's my story. \n\nI am 21 years old (female), and my boyfriend of 3 years is 23. This relationship was once everything I could ever want, but the spark is gone now, on my side at least. I still care about him very much, but I have absolutely no desire for intimacy with him, other than just good friend involved conversations. He is still completely in love with me, and it has come to nothing when I have tried to tenderly bring up my shortcomings on the feelings side, because he won't listen to me seriously. \n\nWhat's worse is this: I am in love with another man. This guy, my age, is a good friend of mine. I believe that he has feelings for me as well, and has just yet to tell me. I have been in love with him for years, but circumstances have never been right for us to have something. \n\nHere is the problem, I don't think the other guy knows about my feelings. More of a problem is that I am not willing to leave my boyfriend, who is going through quite a rough patch and really needs me. I am also not willing to cheat. So basically, I am trapped in my current relationship, pining for another. I literally can not stop thinking about the man that I am in love with, and I feel like it's driving me over the edge.\nTL;DR:"}

He likes to joke around sometimes. Anyways, we're going through this lesson on salvation. We come across the topic of love. So he asks the question, \"What is love?\" Some people are trying to explain it then there's people like my step-brother saying, \"Baby don't hurt me.\" Me, being the guy I am, want to make a joke too. So, I blurt out, \"Shrek is love. Shrek is life.\" The entire room goes silent. People are looking at me like, what the hell? I just kinda look across the room at my step-brother for support and he's facepalming like there's no tomorrow. There was one kid in the whole room laughing. He was that awkward kid that sits in the corner and doesn't talk ever. The pastor just stared at me and went on like nothing happened.\n\nLater, at like 1-1:30 he texted me and was like, \"What did I just search?\" Confused, I ask, \"What do you mean?\" He sent me a screenshot of the Shrek is love, Shrek is life video.

My boyfriend of 4 years and him are close friends. We were talking about attraction in general and he kind of alluded to there being some sort of attraction between us. I said, \"what do you mean\" and he said \"you know what I'm talking about\". \n\nThe thing is, I have absolutely no fucking idea what he is talking about. Maybe he is attracted to me, but I am not even 1% attracted to him. I think he wanted to just say it and move past it but I kind of didn't let him off the hook, because I didn't want him to have the wrong idea. I said \"No I actually have no idea what you are talking about, I hope you don't think there is something between us\". He didn't offer much more information, but I was pretty drunk and kind of badgered him about it a little. He was very respectful, has a girlfriend, and wasn't hitting on me or anything. It just kind of freaked me out and I was like WHAT, no no no no. I said I am sorry if I ever made him feel that way. Should I tell my boyfriend?

I'm already following a \"lazy portfolio\" for my Roth IRA, consisting of about 40% in the S&P 500, 40% in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, and 20% in the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund. If I were to do the same funds in my non-IRA account, I feel like I'd be doubling my risk...but I also feel like my risk is diversified enough to be essentially a \"total market\" risk, so I don't know if that can be avoided?\nTL;DR:"}

They make me call them everyday and if I don't they will either throw a fit or guilt trip me.  I would understand their behavior if I was a huge fuck up and can't take care of myself but I went to a top 10 undergrad, a top 10 med school, and I am currently a resident in a competitive program.  Whenever I miss my dad's calls or don't respond to his email within a day he will call me nonstop until I answer.  I am pretty busy lately (~80-100 hrs a week for the next 4 yrs) so I think its pretty reasonable that I miss some calls, but this is totally unacceptable and unreasonable to my parents.  Everytime i call them back, they always ask me what I was doing, and usually its because I was at the hospital working, and then they ask me why I didnt take their call, and it just completely frustrates me.  Also, they seem to dissaprove of everything I do, from my hobbies to my wife.  For example, I like to exercise and work out and my dad tells to stop because he says it will make me look like I have lower \"social status.\"  He doesn't like my wife because he think she's too short (she's 5'2'').  I can go on for days with this.  But I think they also want to move in with me sometime in the future and I don't think I can handle that.    Also it's not like I have no siblings either, but I feel like they only treat me like this because I am the oldest.  So Reddit, how do you guys think I should handle this move in thing with my parents without completely destroying our relationship.  Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

Since then, I rebuilt myself. I've lost a lot of fat and gained a ton of muscles (people have told me that I look like Enrique Iglesias now) , I've grown 2-3 inches taller (I'm 19 by the way), dress better, got a new hair cut, I've made a lot of new friends, I'm actually way more popular now (I used to be super shy and insecure when we went out) , and I got my shit together and I'm getting good grades, and have a solid job. For some reason, I question what's going through her head now, if she saw me (or seen my pics on Facebook)? She dumped me because she didn't have time for a boyfriend, but started dating another guy 2 weeks later... It really broke my heart. I still wigh her the best though because I cared a lot about her at one point though...\nTL;DR:"}

The relationship used to be an extremely tumultuous one, but for past year, it has more-or-less stabilized. Both of us are now very happy, and we only have the occasional argument (~1/month).\n\nHowever, even though we now have a very healthy relationship, I still have nightmares every night. They involve things like my boyfriend losing his temper and breaking up with me for small things / things outside of my control; him talking about me not being attractive enough; and him saying inappropriate things to other girls. I admit that he used to do and say all of these things in the past; however, he's been a perfect gentleman and boyfriend for around a year now...\n\nI never think about these things when I am awake and conscious, and I thought that I had already forgiven him for everything...

It's been really hard for her to find work - even part time.\n\nShe keeps talking about needing a fresh start and go and \"experience\" life.\n\nI believe that I have held her back. About 5 months after we started dating, my roommate at the time moved back home to another state and gave me about a week notice, leaving me high and dry with nowhere to go. My GF stepped up and told me I could stay with her (this was about 1 month after she moved out of her mom's house for the first time).\n\nI accepted, and then everything just felt natural, like this was supposed to be happening. Now, 2.5 years later, we still live together. I know that she wants to experience living on her own, being independent, etc. and I feel like I've robbed her of that because of my own irresponsibilities. \n\nWe had a long talk last night, and the last thing I want to do is lose her, but at the same time, I wouldn't be able to continue the relationship knowing and feeling that she'd rather be doing something else...something that makes her happier.

To explain this nonsensical statement, I'm basically failing all of my classes, and I feel like I cannot connect to anything in the school whatsoever (people, subjects, activities, etc.) I live with my mother (parents divorced, father in another state) who is slowly but surely turning to rage towards this lack of initiative in school, some of which I feel is justified, some of it not. \n\nApart from this, I seem to have an extremely hard time focusing on certain subjects, mainly things that I cannot see an immediate use for. I love my job as a cashier and checker at a grocery store, for instance, but my mind seems to shut down when I'm sitting in that small desk, surrounded by other angsty teenagers, in geometry. I feel miserable about this when my mom feels the need to talk to me about my shortcomings, as I just feel worthless and helpless, never able to make my own decisions, never able to plan for my future, always stuck in this little realm of home, work, and school which-while seemingly stable- will soon be ripped apart by the harsh reality of adulthood.\n\nApart from this, I play video games. Way too much. There, got that one out. I feel that games that I play (Skyrim, Minecraft, TF2) have become a major escape from reality for me, and I will spend massive amounts of time playing, thinking, and contemplating them, instead of, you know, putting any thought into that history assignment that's due tomorrow, or the job that I may want to work at in the future.\n\nI want to thank anyone who read all of this, and I'll be happy to answer questions related to my very splotchy and hurried-out wall of distressed gibberish.\nTL;DR:"}

Things were really great between us for the two and a half months we dated, and I really fell for her fairly quickly. But Allie decided she wasn't ready for a serious relationship at the time, so we ended things. It was fairly mutual, but I still didn't want it to happen. We talked every now and again, and even saw each other every once and a while over the next few years, but things certainly weren't the same.\n\nYesterday Allie texted me asking arbitrarily about whether or not she had seen me on campus. When I said she hadn't, she asked me how I was doing, and I quickly responded in a polite manner. But her response was quite lengthy, talking about the difficulties of moving on into the real world (she just graduated last year, and I am about to graduate). She also mentioned that even though we hadn't talked in a while, she wanted to tell me these things because she knew I'd understand.\n\nAllie wants to get together some time soon to catch up, which we've often done in the past. What is different now though is that she really seemed like she had a lot more to say to me this time around, and she reached out to me, where I am usually the one reaching out to her. I've often felt that we would still be really great together, and that we simply were dating at the wrong time in our lives.\n\nSo my question to you all is how should I approach this? I'd like to test the waters and see if there is a chance of rekindling something, but I don't want to be too forward about it. If anyone has had a similar experience I'd love to hear about how it went.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I aren't very confrontational people, either.\n\nThat being said, our neighbors are rather obnoxious. The man that lives there drives this rather nice mustang. He likes to park right in front of his apartment. (It is understood that 2nd story residents should get to park a little closer since we have a flight of stairs to walk up. This is a nice and quiet complex). When he locks the doors of his car, he honks the horn several times more than necessary. He then slams his front door, full force, shaking our entire living room. It occurs every time he comes back from something. We can countdown the seconds until the loud slam. It occurs at any time during the day or at night. This has been the norm since we moved in, in July. More recently in the past month, we've heard them screaming at each other in the middle of the night, and it is quite disturbing. We've missed out on a good bit of sleep because of them.\n\nThis brings me to my issue: The man that lives there rang our doorbell in the middle of the night, just to inform us that they can hear us when we \"run around,\" and he \"didn't want to sound like a douche bag.\" I didn't raise the issue, because I had stumbled over my own two feet earlier, so I apologized. I am really angry though. We have not bothered them once about anything and then he has the nerve to bother us in the middle of the night.\n\nIs he justified or do I have grounds to complain to our landlord about this?

He always wants to hang out or do something, and when we tell him no he takes it personally and gets offended. Whenever someone disagrees with something he says, he argues and won't let it go until you finally give up and tell him that he's right (even if he isn't). And he's extremely self-centered.

She told me she was \"electro sensitive\" and that her hair attracted electricity. So she had fashioned some sort of mad max meets knit club yarn and metal string combo that attached to her hair and ended in a giant ball of string and wire that she apparently let trail behind her everywhere she walked in NYC. And the sidewalks of NYC are not the greatest thing about the city unless you are dog. She seemed excited to share this with me. I fake laughed and got out of there with my coffee.

Correct me if I am wrong on any of this.\n\nMy question to you Reddit, in light of this theory that traits can be inherited by dogs, is whether or not we can apply this same theory to humans; do different races of humans have genetically determined traits. If so, do you find it morally acceptable to label people by these traits, given what the consequences for society would be if we endorsed this kind of thinking.\n\nSorry if this has been asked before, I was unable to find it, so I thought I'd pose you the question.

It felt so harsh and sudden. I was in shock, and even now it is still sinking in a few days later. She gave a few vague reasons as to why, which I didn't fully understand but I'm reflecting and I think I'm gaining clarity. She had been questioning things for a week or so and decided the night before, without ever expressing it to me.

We both mutually loved each other, and we wanted to spend all of our time together.\n\nIt was time for her to go back to school which is about four hours away.

I finally just straight up asked if everything was alright, and she said she didn't feel 100% about love.\n\nI was willing to take it down a notch and wait for her because I really care about her. I then noticed she was being even more avoiding of me when we would talk. I put everything on the table and asked her if there was something she was wanting to tell me.\n\nShe said that she was going to wait until break to tell me, but she didn't think we could work out the distance. It was too hard on her. She wanted to come back on break and see how she felt about being together, but I sniffed it out before she had the opportunity to do so. \n\nWe ended it, and she's coming back either today or tomorrow and we're going to swap our things back to each other. We're still friends, but obviously breakups are difficult, and I'm already dreading seeing her again because I already know it's going to be extremely sad.\n\nI feel like I jumped the gun by asking her if she still wanted to be together, but at the same time, I feel like I was right to ask because her heart wasn't in it 100% but mine was and it likely would have ended anyways.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been dating for three months, going out at least once a week in that time and we've had a great time. She disappeared. Literally, and I don't know what's up. I've not met her parents yet so that'd be going too far to contact them, but after she asks if I want to hang out later in the week, her iMessage suddenly goes off and she doesn't respond to texts/calls. She doesn't use Facebook much so that's not helpful. I don't want to seem like some kind of stalker or anything, and we've been happily dating for three months so that's kind of hard to do, but I'm still seriously apprehensive about trying to contact her any further.\n\nIs this her way of breaking up? I thought that, but she acted like she wants to hang out, tells me she can't wait, then I hear nothing from her. She didn't show up for the date or anything. She doesn't seem so immature so as to break up in that way anyway. I keep feeling like I'm just being over-attached and I'm wrong about her, but I'd cut contact if she just told me she didn't want to see each other anymore. It's no big deal.

I'm having a nightmare of a time with computer repair.\nPOST: The problem is this: the screen on my Lenovo Thinkpad SL500 series laptop went out Dec. 3. The left hinge had been loose, and I assume that when the screen went out, a connection had finally been broken. There were multicolored lines across the screen, but I couldn't see anything else. The screen itself worked fine, turned on, was the right brightness, but nothing else was coming through. I took it to a repair shop on Dec. 6, paid a $50 deposit, and was told it would be done by the 17th. Reddit, today is February 2nd, and I still haven't gotten my laptop back. First, the screen is delayed by two weeks. Second, they ordered the wrong screen. Okay, understandable. They said it was because the screen's serial numbers matched mine, but it clearly didn't because it didn't fit. Fine. Then they tried to order another screen. Again, delayed. They're claiming now that Lenovo no longer makes my screen. They only JUST provided me with a loaner laptop (shitty little VAIO that I can't bring to class because the battery is shot). The original quote was $330, including labor and parts. Then, they tried to make me pay for shipping. They never quoted me on shipping, which cost $20. Thankfully I was able to get them to remove that charge, but they're still expecting me to pay the full price. I understand paying full for the screen, but at this point I'm beyond infuriated, they're not returning my calls, and I really don't want to pay labor for something that has become this terrible of a clusterfuck.

Completely enthralled by him, and after a year of some difficulty between the two of us, cut all contact with me and moved in with the man she'd known for a month or so.

He's funny, clever, sweet and I love him very much. Problem is none of his bosses seem to see him as such. He was recently let go from his job of nearly seven years. He worked long long hours and seemed to be putting in a lot of effort. I'm not entirely sure what happened, except that he didn't get along well with management and seemed to be slowly edged out by his supervisor.\n\nI know this isn't because he's not bright - he went to a very prestigious school and he has a degree in a challenging field. I thought maybe this was just a weird budget fluke or mismanagement, or clashing personalities. But he recently started a new job and the same thing seems to be happening. \n\nI think he may not handle criticism well or maybe he's the type of person who needs to be his own boss, I'm not sure since I'm not there. He's getting very depressed from these perceived failures, and I'm not really sure what I can do to help. It's also becoming challenging because our life plans are on a permanent hold. We really want to move in together, but if this job doesn't work out he will likely have to move back in with his parents a few states away. At which point, I don't know what would happen to our relationship. Law school is out of the question right now due to college debt.\n\nI'm doing well at my job, but I'm just constantly worried about him. I want him to do well so badly, but I also try not to put pressure on him. I am also concerned about what this will mean for our future.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: How does one hook up non exclusively\nPOST: I've been hooking up with this girl for the past few weeks. Sometimes sex, sometimes we just lay and talk. The comfort level is extremely high as we have a lot of the same friends and knew each other decently well before anything romantic. I guess I'll just give a brief anecdote in attempts to describe our \"dynamic.\" Last weekend after drunkenly sleeping over, she cooked a small breakfast while I bumbled around her apartment naked, laughing and taking photos. It was light, playful, and fun.\n\nIve always been one who favors intimacy. It is the human connection that I value when being with someone, and I only really like to view sex as a means of achieving this intimate connection. \n\nAlthough, I am 24 and do acknowledge the need to be self reliant and avoid heavy dependency right now. Thus I'm put in this weird paradox where I just want frivolous romantic experiences, but I find myself getting caught up on the girls I'm sincerely attracted to. \n\nSo, back to this girl. It wasn't until last night when we finally talked about what it is we're doing. She wants it to be ok with sleeping around. I've never done so before, but I think I could be cool with it. I guess my real issue (and need of reddit advice) is how is this best achieved? I would still like for our relationship to be healthy. I don't really want to be jealous or insecure. Do people still establish certain rules in this instance? I could see it being weird if, for instance, she leaves a party with someone else in front of me. Or if she hooks up with someone a little too close to home. I also feel like this means I have to concertedly try and get with other women otherwise she'll have all the power. \n\nI feel like non exclusive dating is normally done between two people who are from different friend circles, and when the emotional investment doesn't seem as high. It requires a certain degree of detachment that I'm not sure either of us possess, and a lot of people to pick from who don't all know one another.\nTL;DR:"}

He is my first boyfriend and I am either his second or third girlfriend, but so far, his longest relationship. Sometime last year we said \"I love you\" to each other, but then both decided that it was too soon and took it back, but he initiated it the \"takebacks\". Since then things have been pretty good with minor ups and downs like all relationships have. I let him be the one to say \"I love you\" first this time in an attempt not to rush him into saying something he didn't mean. However, now another couple months later, after 18 months of dating, I noticed he hadn't said \"I love you\" in a long time and I asked him about it. He told me he doesn't know if he loves me. Is it normal to not know after 18 months? He says he doesn't know what it means to love someone and that he thought he meant it when he told me. \n\nI honestly feel like I love him, but don't know how to describe to him why I feel that way. He's a very caring, funny person and I really enjoy spending time with him and seeing him happy, however, he doesn't know if he can ever love me...which worries me. I'm also afraid that the next time he tells me he loves me (if he ever does) that I am not going to believe him. He told me he feels uncomfortable when I tell him I love him so I feel like I can't express how I truly feel about him. The whole situation hurt my feelings and he knows it (I cried), but still remained honest with me. \n\nAnother problem that I have with him that I'm considering to be a small one at this point is that he doesn't ever see himself getting married\u2026ever. It has nothing to do with me and he doesn't know why he feels that way. He just thinks marriages are stupid and that they all end in divorce anyways (his parents are still together btw).\nTL;DR:"}

The NSA, PRISM, the Patriot Act, etc. have yet to infringe upon the quality of our day-to-day lives, and it seems apparent that until that bridge has been crossed, and our lives are directly affected, we will not see the need to take it upon ourselves to enact meaningful change. It also seems clear that in the event of a direct and meaningful affront on American citizens, enacted by the Federal government, the citizenry will have already rendered itself to powerless to confront an attack. Without change now, there will be no hope for change when shit hits the fan, though hopefully it will never come to that. The old ways of protest have been rendered meaningless through overuse and police guidance--no one gives a damn about a crowd of picketers anymore.

Bottom line is he's been my friend for a long time and if they're happy together, then I'm happy. \n\nMy girlfriend however is beside herself and we've just had an argument about the whole situation. She's worried that when I hang out with my friends, that my ex will be there and might \"fall back in love\" with me or vice versa. She's tried to put her foot down and deny me from attending any social gatherings that she might be at. \n\nI told her she's being ridiculous and that I'm not going to not see my friends because one of them chose to get with my ex. I've assured her that I have absolutely no feelings for this girl anymore and that I'm fine with it, but she didn't want to hear it. I'm trying to see it from her point of view but I'm struggling. \n\nI don't really know what advice I'm looking for. Just thought I'd get some outside perspective on the whole situation. Is it normal to not care? Is my girlfriend being irrational or am I missing something?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [21 M] am confused on what to do with a family friend [17F] who I am attracted to and have been for 1.5 years\nPOST: Okay, so first off we met 5 years ago when she joined my sisters year group at school. They became good friends and the two families became close. We've spent time together on holidays with family and have spent time hanging out at each others house, playing pc or ps3.\n\nHowever, in the past year and a half I have become more and more attracted to her - I already know her very well personality wise and have known she'd get more attractive as she got older. \n\nThis is where I hit a snag - I am 4 years older than her and although that's not a big age gap, the fact I am 21 makes potentially awkward? She recently moved schools due to parent issues (divorce is messy) but I taught her sport for the last year. Because of our family history we were quite flirty jokey with each other, which upset her then boyfriend (who she has recently dumped as he turned stalkerish). I am naturally flirty with people I know who don't mind being flirty back and forth and generally know nothing would come of the flirting.\n\nRecently though I feel like there has been a growing bond between us, more than friendship. I am also fairly sure she knows I like her.  However, I am still unsure as to what to do; in part due to being very overweight (exercising more!) and having had depression for last 2 years after a series of trust issues and loss of life in family.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: She's been seeing someone else...\nPOST: Me, 27 M - Chef, has been dating a wonderful woman, 31 F - 9-5er, for the last month.  We've only been able to see each other once a week or so due to our different working hours and days off.  There has been the occasional night where I've managed to meet her at a bar, where she's out with friends, after I finish work.  We also make plans to \"accidentally\" bump into each other at the train station each morning on our way to work for a quick good morning kiss and 5 mins of conversation.\n\nShe's introduced me to some of her friends, we've slept together and she's stayed at my place a couple of times.  Things had been going really well and looked like we were headed into possible relationship zone.  At dinner last Monday she springs to me that she has been sort of seeing someone else since last May but hadn't told me up until that point.  She didn't expect to hit things off with me as we initially met so she could show me around town (I'm new to the city).\n\nShe said that her other relationship is coming towards an end and has been seeing him less and less over the last few months but still went to see him last Friday after she told me about it.  He's never met her friends or has she told them about him (possible FWB?).  She has however told him about me and he said that he's okay with her seeing me (wtf?).  \n\nShe has expressed interest in working things out between us but hasn't ended it with him.  I can't handle her sleeping with someone else AND me.  What are your thoughts, Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

Her reason was, 'I don't jog' but I remember her telling me she wanted to start running again during the date.\n\nI know, she's not willing to take this thing further which is fine.

She has done multiple things to break our trust like doing sexual things with another guy while we were taking a \"break\" (aka no title but we were basically together, still acted the same), kissing a different guy, sending naked pictures to a group of male and female friends. I always find out from other people about these things and then she denies until I bring up the proof. She also expects me not to be friends with certain girls because of jealousy and her own insecurities. She knows all of these things upset me and they haven't happened more than once, but I still struggle on whether I want this relationship. I've tried to end things before or bring the problems to her attention and try to fix them but it usually never works. I would really appreciate advice on what to do.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: what are some non-medicated ways to deal with anxiety?\nPOST: A little background: I started drinking when I was a teenager to be part of that scene and it progressed into adulthood, eventually leading to becoming a functioning alcoholic. The few times it did get in the way of work, people just laughed it off because I still performed, I was just wobbly and pukey.\nA few months ago, I realized I'm getting a little long in the tooth to still be acting like I'm rushing for a frat. I took a hard look at where alcohol had taken me at times and just gave 'er up. It's been about four months and I haven't had a drop.\nHaving said that, I have noticed something I guess I was masking with alcohol for a very long time. Anxiety. Whenever I felt uncomfortable before, I would just smash some beers or slug from a bottle. Now, I'm forced to tackle those feelings without crutches, and it's getting harder and harder.\nI started a career path that requires me to meet and talk to total strangers. I loved this when I was still drinking because I had someway to cope with that anxiety before and after these encounters. Now, my work is really suffering and I am finding myself depressed that I can't perform. I love what I do (did) and want to continue, but I also love how lucid I am sober, and not being hungover is reason enough not to drink.\nI took some medication some years back for anxiety related to my previous career, and I hated the way it made me feel, so I'm not really wanting to go that route. I'm hoping you guys might have some insight and/or techniques to dealing with it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My SO [22F] and I [23M] are on a break but I'm not certain if we are messing ourselves up.\nPOST: **Backstory**: My SO and I have been together for nearly 5 years. There have been ups and downs but we are generally happy together. What we've noticed however is that due to the amount of time she spends with me, she had essentially given up on her own social life and has become rather dependent on me. So in the interest of helping, I offered to give our relationship a break so that she could have some space. We've set the end of the break to be at the end of summer after which we get back together. It's been a couple weeks into the break and she is making friends.\n\nSo what's the problem? We still meetup, albeit not as frequently, and act fairly flirty to each other. In addition, we've had a couple light non-platonic interactions. She acts innocent and mentions that we shouldn't do that as we are on break, but I know she takes great pleasure in tempting/teasing me. Friends think that this is unhealthy and if she wanted to do those things with me, she should just get back together with me. While I believe that any long term breaks with the intention of getting back together needs a few flirtations/non-platonic events to keep the fires going. Honestly, she is not ready to get back together yet. It's only been a few weeks and in all likelihood, she would just abandon her new friends to be with me. As much she misses me, she likes where she is at right now. I have to agree with her. \n\nSo is our current arrangement bad for the future of the relationship? What should I do instead, if so?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been a lurker for 3 years now, and created an account just to tell as many people as I could how terrible my experience with Expedia has been.\n\nI'm on a weekend trip with my parents to the Portland, OR area and we had made reservations in Wilsonville through Expedia several months in advance. My dad checked with them a few days in advance to ensure that our accomodations were taken care of, saw that they (Expedia) had already charged his credit card and even sent him two emails reminding him that his reservation was coming up and was confirmed with the hotel.\n\nWe arrived at the hotel at 7pm this evening (Friday, July 20), and the hotel staff told us that not only did they not have our reservation, but they had no rooms available, there were no vacancies in any of the hotels nearby, and that we were the second family that this had happened to today! The staff at the hotel informed us that Expedia would be calling us in a few minutes to help us find a room somewhere else. Two hours later, Expedia still hadn't found us anything! And on top of that, the only thing they offered us was a full refund! They expected us to be happy with that, and couldn't understand why my father deemed this \"unacceptable.\"\n\nAnother half hour later, they finally booked us a hotel all the way down in Salem, OR. Not only was this even further south (by half an hour) than we had planned in traveling, but the only thing they offered us was a $25 credit on our account! Needless to say, we will never be booking anything through Expedia ever again. My mom has already nicknamed this the \"vacation from hell.\"\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: No air conditioning in apartment for the last 8 days.  What kind of recourse is available?\nPOST: The air conditioning has not been working in my sister's apartment for 8 days now.  The issue was reported and supposedly repaired on the first day.  The air worked through the night but quit again the next day.  We are now a week later and still waiting on the issue to be resolved.\n\nThe apartment maintenance guys are the ones working to repair the unit.  They refuse to call a professional A/C repair company to get the unit fixed. It has supposedly taken so long because they had to order a replacement part (a part that an A/C repair shop would have readily available).\n\nMy sister has escalated the issue to the apartment company's corporate office and they informed her that it would be fixed by the end of the day.  A little while after making the call, the local manager called and stated that they were \"causing trouble\" by calling the corporate office (apparently an attempt to intimidate my sister).  This manager also balked at the idea that my sister's rent should be discounted due to all of the trouble.  She offered the excuse that she \"Knows somebody in a $200,000 house that has been without air for a few weeks\".  I think this is bogus, because when you own your own home, you can chose another A/C repair company if you are not satisfied with the level of service you receive.  As a tennant in an apartment, you do not get this choice.  Also, most customer oriented A/C repair companies would have the part overnighted to get the repair done as quickly as possible.\n\nThe apartment also provided a portable A/C unit after 4 days of no A/C.  The manager claims that they work fine, but it is severely under sized for the apartment (loft) and does not cool very well at all.\n\nThe situation is getting rediculously out of hand.  what are your suggestions on recourse that is available?  Withold rent? Self discount and take it before a judge if they try to evict?  What can they do?\nTL;DR:"}

And got offered a job with much higher pay, and interesting work.. with the company where Manager A is now working.  \n\nWhen I got the offer I was so excited and relieved to be leaving, but when time came to tell my current boss, all my excited emotions turned around and turned into guilt and shame.

I have a consistent group of friends that I hang out often, I do pretty good in school and have been looking into  going to college to become an English teacher.\n\nAbout a month ago, my family's landlord decided he wanted to sell our house, which he promised he wouldn't do if we took care of it.

Everything is either too small for us, or has too many stairs for my parents, who both have major back problems.

That's not so bad. The real issue is that I don't drive and my parents only have one car that my stepfather uses for work. \n\nIf we move there, which is very likely at this point, I'll have to switch schools a month into my senior year. I'll have to leave behind all of my friends and this girl. I finally asked her out after being her best friend for 3 years.

I am a 23 year old woman from some Middle Eastern land studying in the US.\n\nIn May I met a guy (24) on OkCupid of all places. Wonderful, smart, funny, handsome\u2026 All around perfect. We had an amazing few weeks, and I felt genuinely in love. Possibly the best sex of my life, and we just fit each other. Same goals, same tastes. He is the type of guy that I just feel comfortable with. However, I had to leave for the summer so we decided to break it off, because we didn't know if we were ever going to be in the same city again. (We were in my campus, he already graduated and is looking for jobs in big cities.)\n\nFast forward 2 months; I am in one of the most romantic cities in the world and I meet a handsome local (29) in the rain one night. Stuff of movies; we see each other all the time, he is insanely romantic and treats me wonderfully. A very prince charming type. We are both really into each other and excited about the relationship. He is going to come visit me on campus next month, and I'm visiting him next weekend (I had miles that were about to expire). We talk online every day and he's amazing but I am afraid that what we really had was the infatuation of him being this European clich\u00e9 and me being \"exotic\". \n\nNow the first guy tells me that he can stay in my town for another year for me. I really love him. But I really love the other guy too. I was briefly with both of them, so it's hard to decide. I have no idea what to do. I will be moving to the city of the European guy in the spring, so I know that I have more of a future with him. But the America guy so wonderful and I feel much more at ease with him. With the other guy I always feel like I'm about to mess up and make a fool of myself. I am very confused, and any advice of any sort will be much appreciated. Am I supposed to make a choice? What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Can ADD make some people perform better in school?\nPOST: Lately, I've been wondering if I might have ADD, because I get bored and distracted very easily. I tend to stay at the top of my class unless the class is too easy (read: boring), which makes my brain switch off immediately. As you might expect, this has caused more than a little friction when I sit there complaining to my friends that a class is \"too easy\" and I can't concentrate. I have to work very hard to get myself motivated in a class that's all memorization, but most of my classmates love those classes and do very well in them. I seem to have a completely opposite taste in classes from all my peers. They hate the hard classes, but those are the only ones that can hold my attention.\n\nHowever, when something makes it past my boredom threshold, I can spend hours just doing that, which is why I've done well so far - I can usually figure out a way of looking at the homework that makes it seem interesting to me. But even so, I tend to take a lot longer to do things than other people do because it's hard for me to stay on task or to stay on the *main* task without going off on a rabbit trail to add insignificant details. I enjoy schoolwork enough (thank you, Asian parent!) that spending a long time on it doesn't bother me, except when it's soulless and uninteresting homework. The kind of work that for everyone else is a quick plug-and-chug takes the longest for me, because I have to take a break every few minutes out of boredom. In my opinion, it's wasteful to spend so much time teaching students how to execute a rigid algorithm very quickly... make a computer do that, and focus on teaching them things for which no single algorithmic solution applies (e.g. proofs) and take advantage of the fancy capabilities our biological hardware has for finding novel approaches to problems. So besides being bored, I'll have that mild undercurrent of irritation that my computational resources are not being allocated in a way that takes advantage of them.\n\nI realize Reddit != medical professionals, but have you guys got any insights or advice?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, how can I get a disposable camera developed discreetly?\nPOST: Here's the back story. I am 17, was seeing a girl who is 16 over the summer. Over the summer I went to the beach with my family and my Grandmother bought us all disposable cameras that we were supposed to fill with beach memories and make a collage out of when they were all full. Plans didn't work out so I had an unused disposable camera by my bed all summer. Towards the end of summer said girl comes over and we hang out and fool around for three or four hours. During this time I am snapping pictures of her to irritate her, but she is just playing along and every time I take one she just covers her face and laughs. After I take around fifteen photos we finally get serious and go for it. I lose my virginity (yay...) and we just lie there, naked, talking for another thirty or so minutes. During this time I took the liberty and snapped a few more pictures just to irritate her because I thought she was cute when she was flustered. We finish up by playing Mortal Kombat for about an hour and then I take her home. Shit gets shot to hell, her parents hate me, never even met me, threaten to get a restraining order, block my phone number, threaten to take girl to gynecologist, if she tries to talk to me she goes to military school, etc. Now I'm in my Senior year and she is in her Junior. We've talked at school and are going to try and wait until she graduates and then see if her parents will calm down and get to know me before passing their sentence. Now I just feel lonely all the time and have next to nothing to remind me of the good times we had together. So I would like to get that camera developed because it contains two good pictures and they are the only two that I have of us together. The pictures I would like are a side view of us kissing (cliche I know) but I am afraid to take the camera anywhere to get it developed due to the pictures being considered child pornography. Reddit, I would really like these two memories to hold onto but I don't want to be in legal trouble. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

It's the first time I post here and I really need some adive. Before I begin the story I need you to know that on steam(the gaming platform), if you have multiple accounts you can have them all tied to the same mobile phone number, which I had. If you get banned on one of the accounts you instantly get banned on all of them.\n\nTo begin: Me and friend (let's call him Kevin) met each other in this game and became real life friends, visiting each other, building trusts and just pure friendship for the past two years. Recently I stopped playing the game and Kevin befriended my other friend (let's call him Steve) pretty much because they were still playing the game. We were still hanging out on Skype and such, all three of us but since they were ingame I kinda felt left out and just didn't feel like talking to them anymore. I have a feeling Steve convinced Kevin to use cheats in this game and got him banned on his own account. It was a stupid move and he regretted it. Finally after a few days Kevin asks me if he can use my other account I don't use (still tied to my phone number with the other ones) so he can play the game. I said sure, why not? That's what friends are for I mean, HE WOULDN'T CHEAT ON MY ACCOUNT, right? A few days go by and my account gets banned and instantly all my others accounts get banned too, including the account with the expensive inventory. The inventory in this case is frozen and you can't do anything with it forever, all my money are gone and he knew exactly what was going to happen if he gets banned.\n\nI asked him how he got banned and he is trying to convince me he didn't cheat on my account. There are no other people that had access than him.\n\nSorry if the story was long, I just needed to vent a little. Now my question: how to handle this? Should I get angry at him? He knew what would happen so it kinda bothers me but what should I say to him? Should I just stop being friends for him screwing with my money like that?\nTL;DR:"}

A month before I graduate, one of our key holders puts in his two weeks. My store manager offered me the job. Week later she says I'll have the interview with the district manager. Honestly, I didn't even know I would have to have an interview, she made it seem like I already had it. Soon after that I find out they also need an external candidate for every internal candidate. Okay so I have my interview, wasn't bad, wasn't that great either. I wasn't too worried because I had a great record, I was the top associate last year, and this quarter, and recommendations from the store and assistant manager. I go into work that Sunday and my store manager tells me the DM really liked the other guy. This guy had absolutely no experience in retail (which on the paper I received about the job, 1 years experience was a requirement). My SM says she wanted me to have the key, and hire him as an associate, and she'll be talking to the DM about it Monday (which was the next day). I didn't think I was getting it at this point.

Last night, he told me he would be having a friendly meeting with a girl he met there and even linked me to her profile. He said he wouldn't go if I didn't want him to. But I said he could do what he want. When I asked him who initiated the meeting, he said he didn't remember because he deleted the messages. I didn't entirely believe him.\n\nIf they're going to cheat, they're going to cheat, right?\n\nHis ex before me cheated on him and we both find cheating unacceptable in any relationship. I thought I could trust him, but now I am second guessing myself... Even if he doesn't cheat, I can't help but think that him staying on that site means that he is keeping his options open/looking for someone better. Furthermore, about a week ago, he asked if he could \"flirt a little\" with girls on that site. Of course, I said no to that.\n\nAm I being an overly attached girlfriend or what? :|\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [20F] is very wasteful with money and it drives me crazy.\nPOST: I've been with my girlfriend for four years and we've lived together for one. She admitted to me early on in the relationship that she has a bad relationship with money on account to growing up poor, and that it's caused her to have money management issues. I never really noticed until she told me that even after working for a year and a half while living at home with her parents (free of charge), she had absolutely no money saved up. Instead she spent her money on video games, clothes, makeup and other useless crap. When we moved in together, I told her she couldn't spend her money like that anymore since she'd have to start paying bills, and she agreed, since she wanted to get over her spending habit.\n\nWell, it hasn't stopped. She orders useless shit from ebay and puts a lot of money into an online game she plays. She goes on $300 shopping excursions to the makeup store in the mall, and buys clothes she never wears. She bought a fancy tea set she's used once. She'll go out to eat a lot with her friends and treat them. She buys anime and video game merch that just ends up stuffed in the closet. It's not like her money is going into anything productive. She pays her bare minimum of the bills and the rest goes to whatever she wants, and it's frustrating because I want us to save up money and not have to live paycheck-to-paycheck. When I confronted her about it, she said she's get a high from spending money and that it makes her feel good to be able to buy all the things she never would've been able to as a kid. And I understand that, I really do, my parents struggled with money too, and you'd think she'd want better for herself and our future kids by saving up. \n\nI'm starting to resent her. She suffers from depression and I'm sure shopping makes her feel happy, but I can't be in a relationship with someone who's becoming increasingly more financially irresponsible as time goes on. I don't know if I can help her if she won't help herself. If I could take her debit card and cut it in half, I would.\nTL;DR:"}

We are in a otherwise happy and caring relationship of about half a year and live together, but the sex is almost nonexistent nowadays. Maybe once a week or even that but I personally need more sexual activity with my partner. I'm very sexually active and excitable person and he claims to be too, but he rejects 99% of my initiations to have sex with him and it's destroying my self-confidence. He tells me I'm attractive and holds physical contact such as cuddles and kisses, but becomes distant and irritated when I initiate sex. I don't feel sexually wanted by him and I feel like he is disgusted by my attempts to \"seduce\" or be sexually desirable. He has mentioned low mood and possible connection to libido, which I understand, but he hasn't seeked help despite of my advice and doesn't want to talk about it. I feel extremely frustrated and start to think that's just an excuse..\n\nI really don't know what to do and my self-confidence is falling apart day by day because of this.

I've been married for 15 years, and I love my wife. I have never intended to cheat in any way or leave her. However, I became emotionally attached to a female coworker over the last 3 years. She also is married, and I know that she is committed to her husband. We became good friends, having many things in common. We worked together on a large project, and as a result spend the majority of our days together. We became too close. We never got physical, nor did we discuss becoming physical, but there was definitely chemistry on both sides. She is 10 years younger than me, and I never thought she would have taken an interest as she is what I would consider to be \"out of my league.\" After several months of this, something happened and she decided to start pulling back. I don't know if her husband found out or if she just realized it wasn't healthy. I knew what was going on, but tried to remain friends with her and give her some space. She has become more and more distant, to the point of not even acknowledging my presence when I would walk by in the hall and say hi. There were some things that I had felt I had handled somewhat poorly, so yesterday I went to speak to her and apologized. She at first insisted that I had nothing to be sorry for, but when I had finished, she told me \"Thank you.\" She said this more emphatically than I have ever heard her thank anyone before. This morning, I went on facebook and saw that she has unfriended me. I knew this was coming, and I know it's for the best - for both of us, but it is killing me. I love my wife more than anything, but I also love this woman more than any other woman - other than my wife. I know the relationship wasn't one sided, she actively pursued it for a long time, probably even more so than I did. I know this is for the best, but it hurts like hell and I don't know how to deal with it or if I can continue to work here.\nTL;DR:"}

My wedding is 3 weeks away and my best friend has decided that now it the time she must get her hair dyed green. I've known her for 6 years, the whole time her hair has been either dark brown or black, both of which look very natural on her. All of a sudden, she decided to get the ends of her hair dyed green to look like a mermaid right before my wedding, and I'm a little upset about it. \nI see the wedding as a great opportunity to have professional photos taken of us, which we never have before, and as my family is rather conservative (aesthetically, not politically), I think it's kind of a bad time for her to debut a drastically different look. \nAnyway, I want to know if I'm being ridiculous in asking her to put off her hair appointment until after the wedding. I've asked her for almost nothing else, wedding related, and I feel it's pretty reasonable. When we talked about it, she asked if it was okay, and I said I didn't think it was the best idea, but pretty much told me she was going to do it anyway.\nFor reference, she's not a bridesmaid, as we're not having them or groomsmen, so she has not spent any wedding-related money thus far.

However, my SO brought up that there was a big card game tournament Saturday that he wanted to attend. Keep in mind that while I absolutely support my SOs hobbies, I usually have to keep myself preoccupied at these events. However, I knew how important this was to him so I compromised and said we could go since I felt we'd have the next day for us.\n\nThat is until he brings up another big event happening Sunday that he also wants to attend which means he'd have to take me home early. This time I really felt I didn't have an option but I still wanted to show that I supported him so I agreed to it in the end. \n\nThat leads us to today where I get a text from him saying, \"This weekend might not be a good time for me to see you. I'll have to playtest Friday for these two events and I'll be teaching a friend of mine as well so I know you'll be super bored.\" Now, if he had told me all of this /before/ making plans with me, I would've had absolutely no issue with this whatsoever. However, he /did/ make plans with me and doesn't seem to want to meet in the middle even though I try to discuss it with him to see if we can.\n\nI believe that the way he sees it is that he can always make it up to me another weekend which I trust he would do.

It went as far as me taking his virginity. I had never been so happy. It was truly a blissful experience. I had never experienced being so happy and I was so relived that I could correct my mistake of two years ago. \n\nThen two weeks later after one of our outings I finally confront him about where we are. I wanted a concrete footing as we weren't really anything. He said that we should put romantic activity on hiatus and that he wasn't emotionally ready. The shoes on the other foot right!?

I understood and told her the implications and she was a little bit less emotional but agreed we should be together.\n\nToday I asked her what she wanted. She replied she doesn't know.\n\nThis whole episode has been very taxing emotionally for me. I have had to evaluate a lot of my life plans most of which we agreed upon because of this. If my gf take a break I'm fine. But she admits that she might change her mind 'in a week'\n\nI am not sure what to. I leave this Sunday. I feel like we are not in agreement on what we want with our relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

Things were great though, he treated me very nice, I liked him a lot and honestly would absolutely date him if things were different: after a few weeks it became apparent that he was a bit wishy washy, he has two kids that are out of state and after the second time of him going to see them, I realized I wasn't up for that. \n\nSo I ended things about a week ago, I had to work and travel again, so I left his things in a bag outside my house. I let him know where his stuff was, and because I would probably take him back if he kept texting me/calling me, I explained everything and told him about his stuff.\n\nSince then he's left me two notes on my door, he took his stuff already and I'm kind of freaking out. So far I haven't been home when he left the letters, but I'm worried about what to do if he tries to show up at my house while I'm home.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My Dad faces up to 5 years in prison for stealing $45 from his mom 39 years ago\nPOST: When my dad was 17 he was a wild kid. He let his mom (My Grandma) borrow $45 from him when he was 17. Time went by and his mom never paid him back so he wrote a $45 check in her name and cashed it. She called the police on him and he spent 1 1/2 years in prison when he was 17 years old. After he got out he was a convicted felon. Fast forward to around 4 months ago, Him and I were shooting guns on county land where there are no houses. Someone called the cops and we talked to the cops for a good 3 hours. After that my mom came and picked me up and he got arrested for being a felon with a weapon. He was unaware that he was a felon because when he went to prison he was only 17, a minor. Yesterday was his court date and they want to give him 4 years probation or 18 months in prison. Apparently in Florida (Where we live) it doesn't matter if you are a minor or not, if you commit a felony you are a felon for the rest of your life. I don't know what to do. He has another appearance in September to see what he has to do. I'm 15 so I don't know much about this legal stuff but there is some smart people on Reddit and was wondering if any of you could help. We don't have that much money and my mom can't work. So if he went to prison we would loose our house because he is our only source of income. His lawyer is also incompetent.\nTL;DR:"}

I've had sex in the past with a few girls I've dated and only one of them was actually a virgin. I feel like I legitimately messed up because at that point, I hadn't been with any first timers. Long story short, I was told it was too much for her and we stopped almost as soon as it started and our relationship ultimately failed after a few weeks due to that and other issues. \n\nFast forward a year and some months later and I begin dating my current girlfriend after a few short lived relationships. She's honestly an amazing girl who's extremely innocent and doesn't even curse and it's kind of like a scene from \"A Walk to Remember\" (yes, guys watch romantic movies too!) because my past, like Landon's, is filled with bad decisions and mishaps that I've corrected over time.\n\nFast forward again to present day and my girlfriend and I have taken the initiative to start experimenting sexually and it feels nice knowing there's trust there but then I start worrying about messing up and having the same thing happen again. I know all girls are different and I don't EVER compare any two girls to each other but the fear is there. \n\nIn short, my question is \"How can I make her first time better?\" I know going slow and using safewords is important, I just need to know what to tell her and what else I can do so that her first time with me isn't her last and so I can help her with her transition. Our relationship is about a LOT more than sex but I don't want to ruin the whole experience with her and make it so she's terrified of it.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [24 F] with my bf [23 M] of 4 years, didn't technically cheat during a month+ break but still feeling guilty\nPOST: Hi Reddit - I'll try to keep this not-long. I met my boyfriend James through a mutual friend about 5 years ago. We didn't click immediately, but after our first serious conversation it became apparent we understood each other as fully as 20-somethings possibly can.\n\nAbout two years in, after a long conversation, he suggested that we break up, saying that our situation was too taxing (long distance, first semester of grad school, etc) to have a healthy relationship, and I agreed. It was incredibly painful for both of us and I can't say I made the best decisions right afterwards. First, agreeing to go home with a guy in my program after a group night out getting drinks, about 4 weeks after the breakup. Regretted it immediately afterwards, felt sick to my stomach like I had just cheated. Second, agreeing to go back out with James a week after that cause we were both pining hard. \n\nOf course, I told him about the one night stand during that conversation, and it hurt him pretty terribly. We were each other's first serious relationship, and being serially monogamous people (or so I thought) he said he felt like he didn't really know me, which definitely cut deep. We got off to a rough start, but we've steadily built the relationship back up - and past- the level of trust we had before. \n\nThe problem is, even though he says he's gotten over that incident, I know the memory of it is still painful for him - and, two years later, I still feel incredibly guilty and disappointed in myself. I lost a chunk of self respect over that, and I'm definitely less confident as a result, which is one of the biggest impediments in our relationship right now.  The insecurities of not being good enough of a person / not deserving my bf are better, but still there. Reddit, do you have any advice for / experience with dealing with this kind of guilt?\nTL;DR:"}

We've had our ups and downs, but all in all our relationship is great and we're really happy with each other. We live together too which is great. \n\nThere's only one thing that bothers me.\n\nMainly it's that my boyfriend is super into 'assholes'. I'll admit I can be a dick at times and that's one of the main things that drew him to me (his words, not mine). \n\nI don't mind acting like that. It turns him on and is what I'm used to doing anyway. The issue is, he's pretty insecure, with a lot of ghosts in his past, anxiety, depression and other problems. I really love him so I've done my best to work through that stuff with him, and it's really paid off. He's started to come out of his shell and socialize, which he never used to before. Thing is, when I help him with this stuff by necessity I have to be nice and tolerant (for example, not jokey about his quirks like I am usually). And I don't mind doing it. \n\nBut I've noticed he really acts less interested during those times - his libido's lower, he gets annoyed at me more easily, etc. I don't like that. The moment I get back to teasing him and being a dick he goes back to his usual lovey-dovey self.\n\nI guess overall I'm wondering whether I should act nice to help him overcome his issues at the risk of him getting cold with me, or continue acting how I'm used to.\n\nI don't want to be abusive or take advantage of his insecurities but it really seems like it's what he wants sexually/romantically. But at the same time I don't want him to be struggling with his issues forever. It can make him really clingy sometimes. \n\nI'm supporting us until he gets a job, and I'd get him a therapist for that stuff but it's not something I can really afford right now.\nTL;DR:"}

Things slowly deteriorated until a few days ago she decided she was moving out and seperating. We talked and she decided that wasn't what she wanted to do and so we've been trying to fix things. On the surface she seems fine, acts normal as she did before. But last night I asked her about our physical relationship (or lack thereof) and whether or not I should be worried about it. She got defensive about it and told me she didn't know how she felt. What should I do? I love her and I want to regain what we had.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [27 M] with my ex[27 M] of a year and a half broke up due to time issues. Having a hard time.\nPOST: My ex and I broke up a month and a half ago after dating for a year and a half.  It was mostly my doing and I am having a hard time with my emotions.  He started med school just before we started dating. I understood it would be a busy time in his life and I would try my best to work around his schedule.\n \nAbout a year later, I started taking night courses to work on my masters, while working full time too.  I became just as busy as him, but after the semester starting coming to an end, I've been realising that he wouldn't make time around his schedule to work with mine.  Instead, he just became even MORE busy with his extra curriculars.  \n \nI wasn't expecting him to stop doing what he wants, obviously, but if he just filled his schedule with more sports instead of trying to schedule things in a way that at least allowed us to study together or spend time together when we COULD. It made me feel like he didn't want me, because if he did, I would be more of a priority.  Either that, or he just felt like he 'had' me and didn't need to put effort in the relationship.  We talked about this and he basically just said we are both busy and thats probably the reason things were stale. But on my end, it was just that it seemed like he stopped putting effort into the relationship, whether he realized it or not.  Regardless, he said things weren't going to change because he wouldn't 'stop doing what he wants to do' and I had to break it off because I knew I wouldn't be happy in the long run.\n \nI am the one who called things off but it's been a month and I am having a much harder time than I thought with this break up, and I am not sure how to process these feelings, especially since he didn't do anything wrong to me. It just wasn't working out.  Worse of all, I have been feeling regret and like I did the wrong thing for quite some time now.\nTL;DR:"}

His grandmother spends her entire day on Facebook. She continually 'falls in love' with men on FB that says they were in an accident and need money to come to the states, they love her and want to be with her, etc. Unlike most everyone else in the universe, she doesn't understand that these are all scams, and instead finds ways to give them money.\n\nOne of the main problems with this is that she is incredibly poor. She hasn't worked in years and her only source of income is her disability check and welfare/food stamps. She cannot afford her bills, but will take out loans and send them to these men. My boyfriend currently lives with her in order to help take care of her, along with his grandmothers live-in boyfriend/care taker. \n\nI can't even begin to explain how frustrating it is dealing with this so often. A quick google search of the last person to scam her showed that this person was a well known alias of a scam artist, but she claimed that we had went back to his room and made the website just to spite her and ruin her relationship. When she went to the bank to send money last time, they told her he was a scam artist and told her his name was on a no send list, but of course, we apparently went to the bank and got them in on our scam to ruin her life.\n\nBut here we go again, she just came back her to try and get us to take her to Kmart for secret reasons and that we had to take her not her boyfriend (because he would have stopped her, and apparently thought we wouldn't). Is there any resources or things we can do (besides deleting her facebook). I only say not deleting because literally 98% of her day is spent on there playing games and contacting distant relatives, but if need be, it's our final resort.\nTL;DR:"}

His family kicked him out when he was in his teens and at one point his mental problems were so bad that he couldn't even dress himself, much less clean up his stuff. \n\nAnyway, he's now living on welfare and renting a room in this student house.\n\nThe problem is that he leaves food, trash and dirty dishes everywhere. This has turned the student house into a complete mess. His room smells so bad that you have to stop breathing when you pass it in the hallway.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago, our landlord came by and chewed us both out and said we'd get evicted if we didn't make an effort to be cleaner (I didn't rat him out, I just took the blame). But, since then, this guy has made no improvements. I've been cleaning up after him every week. I'm getting really tired of this and I'm wondering whether I should tell the landlord that the blame is almost entirely on him.\n\nOn the one hand, he suffers from these problems and it must be very hard to deal with that stuff. On the other hand, I don't really like this guy and I don't even think it's because of his mental problems, he's just a bit dickish in general and I don't know if these mental problems really are preventing him from cleaning up.\nTL;DR:"}

I started to suspect that she had cheated but thats really not likely for her. Then about a week ago she broke down and started crying and said she was lonely.  We work different shifts and I work 50 hours a week usually so we haven't seen alot of each other. Anyways we talked about it and I told her I would do my best to get on her shift.

But she said that she wasn't ready for a relationship (she just recently broke up with a physically abusive boyfriend), so I just decided to act like nothing happened, and stay her friend until she decided she was ready. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, I would see her flirt with other guys right in front of me, so after a while, I talked to her about it. Apparently she was so drunk when we said we were attracted to each other that she had no memory of it ever happening. I asked her if it was still true, though, that she was attracted to me. She said that she only said what she did because she was drunk. However, she was just as drunk when she told me this. So naturally she has no recollection of this conversation happening either. And the things she said to me when she was telling me that she did like me were things that did not seem like spur-of-the-moment comments, but more like things she had been thinking for a while. \n\nOh and another note: The time we admitted having an attraction to each other was not the first time we had gotten \"flirty\" with each other while drunk.\nTL;DR:"}

I knew this was illegal so I asked all of you what I should do, and you came through.  One of the first suggestions I got was to contact the NLRB, and that's exactly what I did.

I definitely felt like they had my back the whole time and they were very helpful and professional.  They appointed me a lawyer for the case and we were preparing for trial next month when the company decided to settle.  I got back pay plus interest, the company has to post a notice telling everyone they were wrong and that they're allowed to talk about pay, and they had to offer me my position back (which I declined).  \n\nSo seriously thank you all.

He originally wanted me to be his business partner but I declined as I enjoy my job, it pays well and I have no interest in being his bar administrator. He wanted me to be the admin side and he'd be the sales / people person. He knows nothing about the admin of running a business, nothing about legal procedure and nothing about business finance - his own finances are a mess. \n\nI've talked to him about my concerns and suggested contacting an accountant and/or lawyer to help him with some of the paperwork.

Most of us are adults looking to finally get our degrees.\n\nToday, we gave our mid-term speeches. After every speech, our instructor randomly chooses three people to give quick critiques and assign a hypothetical grade.\n\nThis guy, who I honestly like a lot, gets up there and gives his five-minute on the danger of pneumonia, which is a perfectly valid topic.\n\nOnly problem is... he really blew it. He went way over the time limit, and it was clear at certain points that he hadn't done much to prepare for this thing. At one point, he \"forgot\" the doctor's name and had to look through his notes to find it only to seem surprised that the doctor's name was the same as the disease, which made us all think he just printed out a quick article on the disease and brought it to class to read verbatim.\n\nAnyway, he finishes, and everyone is being really nice to him. The three people who were called on made general comments on how he did good and assigned him two B+ and an A-.\n\nThe professor happened to catch my face when I was listening to these soft critiques and based on my incredulous look of surprise, called on me to make a fourth critique, which kinda surprised me.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, I politely proceeded to dismantle this guy's speech. I must have spent two minutes explaining why he basically failed even though I consider him a friend.\n\nAt one point during my critique, everyone else started laughing when I pointed out that the guy couldn't remember the doctor's name even though it was the same as the disease he was explaining.\n\nWhen I finished, the guy look utterly dejected, and even though the professor specifically praised my analysis (and pulled me aside after class to thank me again for being so honest), I felt (and still feel) like shit for destroying this guy's presentation.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: What pet should I get?\nPOST: Hey guys,\n\nso I hope this isnt inappropriate to ask, but I always had a dog around when I was growing up and now that I moved out from my parents I'd really like to have a pet buddy. \n\nNow I'd love to have a dog, but because of my job and stuff I won't be able to 100% satisfy it, so I'd rather not get one as I don't want for it to be lonely/bored/hyperactive etc.That being said I thought about getting a rodent. I don't really have much \"experience\" with pets other than dogs, but I imagine that a rodent (haven't decided what kind yet) generally is rather low maintenance. Feed it, provide it with a nice cage (with a nice wheel to run :D) and clean it every other day should do the trick right? \n\nThen my mom also suggested a cat. I never had one and I have no idea how they \"work\". I only had a friend once with a couple of cats and it seemed as if the litter boxes had a quite distinctive smell. Now the thing is, that my \"apartment\" currently isn't bigger than a room (I live with roommates until I feel like moving into an own apartment), so smells would make me rather uncomfortable in a rather small and closed room. Maybe I am wrong and he just didn't clean them often enough/properly or whatever, so it'd be cool if you could tell me from experience.\n\nAnother thing is: I wanna have a pet that kinda.....recognizes me and loves me :D. I know that sounds cheesy and weird, especially if you imagine a 200lb guy, but I absolutely hate fishes for example, because they're just there to be looked at, but I actually want to interact with the pet. I realize that dogs are mans best friend and that probably no other pet can love you as much, but how are cats/rodents in that regard and is there maybe even a difference between say a guinea pig and a hamster?\nTL;DR:"}

Prior to this we had made plans to do something nice this coming Saturday (tomorrow) when my parents could watch our 12 month old.\n\nThe night of her birthday we get home and she's expecting me to take her somewhere.  I pointed out that we had planned to do something on Saturday (even canceled other plans with friends) but she had expressed the opinion that we should do something on both nights, going so far as to have requested the night off.  I knew she had asked for Saturday off in order to do something but I wasn't expecting (nor was it communicated) to have to do something that night.\n\nAt this point we had a low-level, passive-aggressive (no yelling) argument and I finally relented and agreed to take her somewhere.  I was moody and quiet for the rest of the evening and was quite frankly disappointed with the whole thing since I had bought her a nice gift and was looking forward to giving it to her as well as doing something nice on Saturday.\n\nI won't lie, one of the big issues for me was the added expense.  I am currently the primary breadwinner so most of the financial planning (and responsibility) for our family falls on me.  We are expecting $3000-$4000 worth of medical (dental) expenses in the next two months as well as the extra expenses that come with the holidays and on top of that we're in the process of buying a house.  I should also mention that this sort of thing has happened before, where we make plans to go do something and she starts adding things on to the point where suddenly I'm spending two hundred dollars over the course of 4 hours.\n\nI think the biggest frustration however, was I had actually gone out and bought something really nice (read: I didn't cheap out) that I knew she would like, had something nice planned and it felt like she was almost saying \"what else have you got?\" (it killed the gift-giving moment).\n\nSo what of it r/relationships, am I justified in my frustration or did I overreact?\n\nFeel free to ask follow-up questions.\nTL;DR:"}

Because we don't want to take away importance from this future actual ceremony with friends/family, we attempt to make as little deal about the civil thing as possible (it was basically just signing papers), we're not wearing wedding rings, are still calling ourselves \"engaged\", etc... We aren't having a religious ceremony so there won't be that added piece of importance either. At the same time, its not a secret, we've told the above to several people.\n\nI'm a little more comfortable being open about it than my fiance, who is more (IMO overly) worried about the future ceremony not feeling \"important\" enough. She didn't tell her step-dad (who she's closer with than her biological dad) until a few weeks after, and he is pissed! And to make it worse, he is reinforcing all of her fears that this future ceremony won't mean any thing, calling the whole idea that we're not considering ourselves married \"laughable,\" saying we tricked him, etc... Heavily skewed by this reaction she's basically convinced we can't go through with our plan b/c a future wedding will feel fake, and is very upset about it. \n\nI basically think he got his feeling hurt and now is just being a dick since that's how I've come to know he deals with things. I do think my fiance made a mistake not telling him earlier. Maybe we made a mistake about how to go about the whole thing (like we shoulda just rushed together a real wedding?), but its in the past now.

It is mostly emotional abuse, but has escalated to physical abuse on at least one occasion.\n\nWhen I found out, I connected her with the domestic abuse hotline, and she has worked really hard to regain a sense of worth and power in the relationship.  She says that there have been no episodes since, and I believe her.  I have spoken with the counselors on this hotline about the role I should play, and they told me that the most important thing to do is make sure that she knows I'm there for her and let her make her own decisions.  (Note: I'm not here for advice on this situation.)\n\n**Problem**\n\nHer birthday is this week, and my grandfather (who also knows about the circumstances) is organizing a birthday dinner for her.  It will be him, his wife, my mom, her boyfriend, and me.  Up until now I have managed to avoid seeing the boyfriend at all.  He knows that I am not happy with him, and my mom says he is \"afraid\" of my judgment (that's rich, isn't it?).  \n\nI REALLY do not want to have to spend a meal with this person.  In my mind, the more separate I can be from him the better.  I *want* him to be afraid of me, and if I go to this dinner I will have to be pleasant which I worry will lull him into a false sense of security.\n\nHow can I approach this situation without making my mom feel torn between me and him?  Should I just suck it up and go?  The most important thing to me is that she understands that I support her.  I can handle a meal with him if it means it is the best decision for her.\nTL;DR:"}

I messed up my first round of school (60k in loans, bad grades).

I've been going to school full time (starting my second year) and also trying to work enough to squeak by. Most of my school loans from before are deferred because I'm in school, and I have minimal costs of living (I make my own food, cell phone is $35/month, paid off my car, have cheap car insurance, etc). I am still working 20-30 hours a week, which gives me about $300/month after rent and bills, but that's enough for me to get by. It's not necessarily that I need to make more money as I just want to be able to have more time.\n\nMy question is, is there anything else I can be doing to make this easier? As it is I am constantly either working/studying, and when I finally do get some time off, I never know what to do since I don't have many friends or hobbies since I'm so busy. \n\nI guess I'm looking for ideas on saving money, or making extra money.

We go to different schools, we are both 21. We started our \"relationship\" when I was visiting her school and we hooked up, no sex. The next day she said we should do that again and that she would probably be coming to visit me in a few weeks. Flash forward after a few more visits from each of us, It is now around Thanksgiving. She told me that she really liked me and I told her the same. We were both home for Thanksgiving break and hung out a ton and things seemed to be going really well. She visited me at my school a week before my winter break started and things still seemed like they were going well and she wanted to hang out over winter break. We have hung out twice so far and both times have seemed a bit weird, the first time we just drove around looking at christmas lights and when I dropped her off she kissed me and said to call her later in the week. So the other night we saw a movie and I put my hand on her knee and she didn't seem very receptive of it, in the past when I would do this she usually grabbed my hand. We drove around for a bit after the movie and at times we were silent. When she dropped me off she just said \"see ya 'bob' (not my real name)\" I wasn't sure if I should kiss her because i had been feeling weird since she hadn't really seemed \"into\" it the last two times we had hung out. Regardless I kissed her and she seemed okay with the kiss. I said I may go out drinking the next night and she said to let her know, (if I go out tonight, I will). But I just can't help but feel concern since she hasn't seemed as into it as she had before winter break. Also we don't ever really talk to much between hangouts, maybe a few texts here or there or a facebook message. Am I just tweaking out or should I be concerned?\n\nSorry for the long post.\nTL;DR:"}

They said I should SHOW her that I like her as much as I do - not explicitly saying it. But until then, how can I do that? Should I just keep the flirty stuff going, or can I move things to the next level?

My hubby is slightly dependent and is a bit introverted. He doesn't express himself with words very easily and requires time to analyze and think about things. We moved a bit quick and got married only a few months after we got together (odd because I always swore I would never marry). I don't regret that decision in the slightest. I love him very much. We didn't 'date', neither of us have ever really 'dated' before. He moved in, we clicked immediately, and after that it was on. I have depression. It doesn't happen often but it started many months ago. I didn't realize it until about 2 months ago. I haven't had it this bad in over 10 years. Needless to say the depression coupled with my fear of being hurt or rejected caused me to hide behind my wall. I asked him to move out about 3 months ago (which I have been kicking myself for since). We talk often and we hang out occasionally. We hadn't really addressed the issues of the relationship, or my emotional state until I had my 'epiphany'. I have put my wishes to 'work' on the relationship in the open, as well as verbalizing my concerns, issues, and my own shortcomings. After some thought he agreed that perhaps we should 'start' dating one another because we may have jumped too quickly. It's been 2 weeks since the 'we should date' conversation and the most that has happened (other than texting and such) is hanging out once watching a movie and talking about nothing 'important' for a few hours (but talking none the less) before he went back to his place. He and I both work a lot of crazy hours and often times our schedules conflict a little. We still love and miss each other. Any pointers on working on my relationship with the sweet silent type, how to 'date' my hubby, process, or anything else would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nTL;DR:"}

It all started last night, we were hanging out at my place watching a movie. Usually this is followed by a bit of sexy time, but she decided to leave early. She had work in the morning (not that that had stopped her in the past). This was also the first time she came over without getting all dolled up. Which, I'm fine with. Only bringing this stuff up because now my possibly overly-paranoid mind is taking these things as bad signs. But she was very compassionate and touchy feely the whole night so idk. \n\nBut anyway, she goes home and i text her the next day at about 1 PM and she doesnt respond, but she's at work and stuff I understand that. Then I text her at about 5 PM and she doesnt respond. After this, I notice that she has posted on Instagram and made a story on Snapchat, so I know her phone isnt broken. So I text her again (last one) at 9 PM and she still hasn't responded about 2 hours later now. \n\nThis is very unlike her/us. We usually text at least a *little* bit every day. Should I be suspecting that something is up or am i being paranoid/insecure?\n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: The Fins have a holiday to embrace trying new things and failing. I want to bring this National Day of Failure to the United States. Want to help?\nPOST: The Fins, as usual, are doing something amazing. The \"National Day of Failure\" (NDOF) is a day set aside to encourage people to try something new without the fear of failing. The purpose is to attempt something you're quite certain you might fail at, just for the sake of giving it a shot. I want to bring this idea to the United States and have our own day set aside to embrace failure by trying something new and failing (sometimes miserably) together.\n\nSo, Reddit, what do you think? I already grabbed a few obvious domain names to host a site. I'm decent at developing sites, writing copy, and doing system/database administration, but I'm pretty terrible at getting the word out (and I'm sure someone could write much better copy and build a better website than I).\n\nMy current idea for the site is:\n\n- A concise video with short clips of people who have tried the idea of \"failing on purpose\" and the benefit they received from giving it a shot.\n- Some variety of community system so \"group failures\" can be organized and everyone can share their idea for how to fail on NDOF\n- A \"Spread the Word\" section with tools for getting the idea out (pamphlets, etc.)\n- A video submission section so that, after the first NDOF, I can put together a \"Life in a Day\"-style video showcasing wonderful failures and unexpected successes (I know there will be many)\n\nIf you're interested in the idea, please let me know! And even if you're not constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. I think this could prove to be a very influential idea for a lot of people that allows them to realize through experience that failure is intimately associated with success, and there's nothing wrong with trying and not succeeding.\nTL;DR:"}

You'd think with 100W RMS you'd get some bumping, but there's really nothing coming out of the system. It does get pretty loud, but when you bump up the bass on the EQ, the whole thing begins to distort. The subs can't seem to handle it and it's just a big fail. \n\nI was wondering if I could just slap on a sub like this [Sony] into the current system to help boost up the bass, or whether it'd be better to just scrap the system and start all over.\n\nMy budget's $100. And before anyone says something like \"the total price of the speakers you already have is over $100,\" I paid around $30 for the lot, and I kinda still wish to use them in the new system.\nTL;DR:"}

Such as use the app \"iFile\" which allows you to change app files. So a few months back I was browsing around on iFile, looking for things to screw around with on my phone. I discovered a Crossy Road folder and its files, and looked inside. One file had a list of things similar to this:\n1. <info>\n<info>\nUnlocked: false\n2. <info>\n<info>\nUnlocked: false\nJackpot! If you haven't played Crossy Road, I suggest you not because its addictiveness will possess you. That was a list of different unlockable players in the game, collectables sort of. I knew, of course, changing the \"false\"s to \"true\"s would be a good idea. So I did. It unlocked the characters for me! At that point, I was thinking about how stupid the game's creators were to put something like that in a text file easily accessible in iFile.\n\nI was wrong. I blame Apple for this, even though Apple didn't invent jailbreaking. They allowed someone to bypass an apple ID login by hacking. This is something that could have been easily preventable.\n\nWhat happened today when I was eating dinner my mom was on her laptop looking at her appstore purchases. Eighty fucking dollars worth of Crossy Road purchases. All I did was change \"false\" to \"true\" on the text file and it did it for me, apparently. $80 down the drain that I could have spent on something nice :c\nTL;DR:"}

After I and a few other students were seated the teachers started the movie, closed the door, and then left. I don't remember any narrative, plot, or reason to the film. I just remember the movie started with people clubbing baby seals. It wasn't figuratively clubbing. No, it showed people full on smashing the brains out of baby seals. Over and over and over until the snow was one large sheet of red blood and men used hooked sticks to pull the seals into twitching piles. The film then showed gophers being shot by high powered rifles, so that the gophers exploded into a fine red mist with body parts flying off. I think there were other ultraviolent scenes but I don't remember. This movie went on for half an hour to an hour or so. I can remember all the kids looking around, looking for a teacher, looking scared, looking for a way out, hell I was one of them.  I remember some of the kids joking and laughing at the movie which made it all the worse. After the movie finished the lights were turned on and we were all lead back to our classes. The teachers never said anything, never answered any questions, it was very surreal and disturbing. I remember asking the teacher that was escorting me back to my class why they made me watch that and didn't they have to have a note from my parents for that kind of shit.

I got my favorite bottle of blueberry white tea, she got something.. less tasty. \n\nAnyway we paid, got in the car, for whatever reason the cup holders were inaccessible in this particular vehicle. Nevertheless there was a spot on my right side in between the door and my thigh where I could stick the bottle to keep it safe from rolling under the brake pedal and murdering everyone. \n\nSo we arrive at the condo, and at this point my tea has slipped my mind, so ignoring my bottle I open my door..  cue my beverage falling out of the car into the parking lot and rolling many feet away in very few seconds! \n\nQuick side note I feel I should mention, my parking lot has carports in it and each carport has room for two cars to park under it.  some have to park in between one carport and the next. so I was parking in between two ports,  which means I had a pillar on either side of the car\n\nBack to the FU. The bottle shoots out the door, and with unique reflexes I lunge forward, extending my arm and slamming my face into the control console for the locks and windows. \n\nNow I'm in pain, delirious AND thirsty! \n\nHolding my hand over my face I shoved the door open angrily, which brought my door mirror into contact with the carport pillar and the rest of the door into contact with the pristine 1966 Chevy Bel Air that was parked next to me.\nTL;DR:"}

Everything has been going fine, except for my older cat being a little cranky about the new kitten, but a couple days ago she peed on the bed!  I admit that the litter boxes(we have two) could have been cleaned more often, so we figured that was the problem.  We have been a lot better about cleaning the litter boxes, they probably got cleaned at least once or twice a day.  Three days later, she pees on the bed again.  \n\nMy husband was furious and wants to get rid of the kitten because she's also clawing the furniture(although she finally started using the scratching post right before she started the bed wetting).  I think we should try and fix it before we consider giving her up, but I don't know what to do, my other cat was a very different kitten.  I've drenched the bed in a spray that has an enzyme formula, so hopefully that helps.  The other cat has an on and off problem with peeing outside the litter box too but she has only ever done it on clothing that is on the floor.  \n\nI'm trying to think of any other important info....Oh, she's very headstrong and kind of does whatever she wants.  We spray her when she's doing something we don't like, and she'll run off but 10 minutes later she's back doing the thing we sprayed her for.  I don't think my older cat is stressing her out because the kitten is already proving to be the alpha cat.  The older cat is vocal when she's bothered by the kitten, but as soon as the kitten makes a move towards her she runs away.  That's everything I can think of, I hope someone has some advice for us!\nTL;DR:"}

Any tips?\nPOST: For the past year and a half my poor 2yr maltese has been having anal gland problems and infections, mostly on the right side. I use to have to help her about once a month or so at the start but since January its now a weekly/fortnightly thing. We've tried changing her food to James Wellbeloved, Acana and Orijen but they've made zero difference (4month trials). Currently shes on four friends, It's not as high quality  but she loves it more than the other 3 and her poops are far more firmer (atleast her first poop of the day is). For the last couple months I've been adding a 1.5 tsp of shredded organic coconut to help firm her stool even further, it is a bit better but it's not made a huge difference for throughout the day. However she doesn't get tear/saliva stains anymore!\n\nSo our previous vet has put her on antibiotics about 4-5 times this last year saying \"next time we flush them\". He never bloody did so after feeling like we were being milked we've now changed vets. First thing she does is flush them !! Bloody finally!! She said \"after the second set of antibiotics not working, it's clear they don't help\" which was my line of thinking. She didn't give us antibiotics this time as it wasn't a severe case of infection by any means.\nAnyways after hearing what we've tried shes says \"if this flush doesnt help, then we can remove them next time if you want\". I feel more confident with this practice, she sounded far more competent and its the biggest and best in Stockholm, it's where all the experts are and where other vets will refer patients to. But Im completely worried about the risks that can come with removal like Incontinence. Im hoping the right gland just needed the flush. But I just have this feeling that removal is in the near future. \nAnything else I can try?\nTL;DR:"}

We had everyday problems like different opinions on not so important topics and on some rather important topics. Possible to work those things out and in my opinion its normal that you argue about different topics in a young relationship.  \n I was a smoker before I met her and stopped a few weeks before I met her. The last 6 months into our relationship I started again first because I was angry and wanted to get back at her after a fight even tho I hided it and she didnt knew.   \nOne night an ex texted me and my then GF asked about her and I lied that she is just an old friend because I was afraid at how she would react that I still had her number.   \nOn christmas we broke up because we fought a lot the last couple of weeks. Im more the guy that likes to spend time for himself and she wanted to spend more with me. I was really selfish and did care more about my needs than hers. 2 weeks after we broke up I met with the girl from the text again and slept with her.\n   My now ex and me saw each other to discuss what our \"everyday problems\" were and we both thought we could work those things out. Problem is I cant stand it anymore lying to her and I feel like I cheated on her because I had sex with another woman (even tho we were not together at that time).   \nI told her I need time to figure out if I really want to be with her again. Reallity is I would love to try it again but I believe I am not worth it anymore and I should tell her that I started smoking during our relationship again because I got angry and that I had sex with another woman. Not to get another chance but so that she can move on and forget about me.  \n I am unsure wether I should tell her or not tell her.   If I do tell her I am afraid that it will break her heart even more than just telling her I dont want to be with her.\nTL;DR:"}

He's also not going to come visit my because tickets are too expensive. \n\nOn the one hand I feel like we would be okay when I get back even though I'd be miserable while I'm away and I also think that our love would kind of extinguish because of prolonged non-contact. We are okay by text, but not great or anything. \n\nOn the other hand I still have this idea that I'm young and I WANT to go out and meet new guys and have new romances. I really do even though I would never cheat on my boyfriend. \n\nSo I'd been thinking about talking to him about a break while I'm away and then we'd see when I get back how we still feel about each other. I'm not sure how we would go about that though, no contact  while I'm away, a little contact? I don't know. I'd still miss him a lot but I would be better able to block that out because I know it's okay and we're on a break for now. Quite sure he'd not be okay with that though ... \n\nWhat do you think, reddit? Are longdistance usually okay? Isn't it too awful? Maybe it's selfish but I just think I'd be too unhappy.

The first time we met was at a University sports event 6-7 months prior to NYE. At the time I met her, she had a boyfriend, but we still flirted a little bit and I got her number and Facebook. We said we would catch up when we got back to our hometown, but none of us remembered. \n\nWe went on a few dates after new year, we are both very sporty so they were based around it. At the end of the second we ended up having sex with each other, and afterward she told me that she has always believed that sex should be between two people in a relationship, and that she didn't want me telling people, and lately when I've been introduced to her friends, they ask her if we are having sex and she says no (when we are). We spent long (but not many) days together, and enjoyed each others company.  \n\nThis was all during the holidays, once university started, we both got a lot more busy obviously, but would find time every once in a while to catch up, although lately we haven't been able to as much, and she doesn't reschedule or makes half assed attempts or excuses. When I start to pull back, or in a bad mood, she knows and will talk to me about it, this is when she shows the most affection, but when I am in a fun playful mood, she is very passive, and brushes a lot of stuff off so it discourages me.\n\nI feel like she just expects me to be around, but is not doing much to keep me around. She is also really bad with responding to messages. I understand she is busy, but if you really wanted to see someone, you would make the effort to, and its always me making plans and her either saying yes or no. I really like her, but I don't feel its reciprocated, and this is discouraging. Am I taking too much initiative or becoming too attached? What should I do.\nTL;DR:"}

So I go grab the shoes from the back and offer her one side of each like the right of one and the left of the other and she told me do whatever is easier for myself, like I said she was so nice. I noticed she was wearing flip flips but her toes were all pedicured up so I figured she wouldn't need a nylon. I give her the shoes and she tries on both and then asks for the next size up of one of them and I run to the back and grab it. When I come out shes standing at the register and she had left the shoes on the floor where she tried them on. I thought, okay weird but whatever I will pick them up after she pays for this pair because the store was empty. The woman leaves so I go to grab the shoes and I just stood there shocked and disgusted. The cuff (Aka the back part where you slip your heel in), inside and out was black. It looked like someone has tried to fill in the back and inside of the white shoes with sharpies. Her feet were that freaking dirty, how does someone have pedicured toes with dirty ass feet! My co-manager was even more grossed out than I was and they were so horrible we had to damage out the two pairs of shoes. In my defense a nylon would not have fit because she was a women size 11.5 and I don't get paid enough to see if people have clean feet or socks all day. The ironic thing is that I tried to sell her our shoe protector spray to prevent stains and water from ruining her new white shoes.\nTL;DR:"}

We started living together basically after the first month of dating. We moved really quickly. We said we wanted to marry each other probably a month and a half into dating. Since we're young we haven't made any steps toward that (no proposal or ring or anything), but we've both basically committed to the idea that we are gonna be with each other forever. \n\nNow the bad part:\n\nI have really REALLY bad depression. I've though about killing myself everyday probably for the past 2 months. This has taken a toll on me and, of course, our relationship.

The fact that my boyfriend is a generally bad listener and plays video games for around 5 hours a day does not help.\n\nRecently, I've found that I've just started liking him less and less. The things he does that used to be cute aren't anymore. We don't really talk anymore. He doesn't listen to me when I try to tell him about my day. But I haven't been perfect either. I cry almost everyday and am a pretty big downer.

My sister (C) has been seeing her boyfriend (P) for three years. P always showed signs of commitment issues and often prioritizes his friends over her. This has been a thing ever since the beginning of the relationship, but for the first year, they were good. With time she felt herself a little distant from him.

He also denies it alters his behaviour in any way - my sister says he becomes short-tempered. He states he has the power to stop whenever he wants, and that he won't use it forever.\n\nBasically, she's seeking advice.

Before that, it was three different posses that only hung out sparsely.\n\nAnyway, for the last month, I've developed sort of a soft spot for one of the girls, 'Dunya.'

She never really stood out among her friends, but from small interactions that I've observed, she seems like she could be a really cool person when you get to know her.\n\nI haven't the faintest idea of whether she'd be interested, though. She became super friendly to me when she was drunk (demanded my phone number, locked her arm around mine when we were walking, usual drunk stuff) but she seems closed off at other times. Other than that, I might find her looking at me every now (when we're all hanging out) and then and we'll make brief eye contact, but that's about it.\n\nSo the issue is that I don't know how to gauge her feelings since it's hard to get her alone. I definitely don't want to ask her out right now because it would be Awkward City if she turned me down (I would still want to be friends with her and hang out if she's not interested in romance.) \n\nAlso, one of the other guys (Ted) seems to like her too, but I'm not sure if they have more of a brother/sister dynamic. When he gets drunk he always tells her how alike they are, they clearly have a very close relationship, and there's a running joke the other guys have about Ted and Dunya being a couple and how cute they are together; I don't know if that's supposed to be ironic or not haha.\n\nHappy to provide more details if needed in addition to this novella.\nTL;DR:"}

So last night I was walking to the bus stop at the mall I work at, when I passed the movie theatre(theater, whatever) and spotted these 3 cute girls. I thought about talking to the cutest one but she seemed out of my league so I pressed on by. Sure enough, they walk out in front of me and the girl I think is cute is looking back every second or two just staring at me. I got this major feeling that she sensed my creepin' stare and was giving me a, \"what the f***, creep!\" Look, so I diverted my attention away trying to be polite. However, I noticed she kept still looking back. At this point I figured I would just separate myself from them and widened the gap as I made my way to the bus.\nNow the girls start yelling. I look back and it's obvious they're yelling to me. Preparing myself for jokes and ridicule, I hesitantly walked over to them knowing this was some kind of mean joke. But when I said hi, the girl said I was really cute and she wanted to give me her number! She put it in my phone for me and texted herself from my phone to prove it was legit! Her two friends were staring and there were some folks just standing around, too. Once I realised this wasn't a joke, I got a major hard on that pushed itself against my pants so hard it was hardly a silouette and more of a high relief sculpture of some sort. My junk was so obvious it protruded out so everyone could see! I didn't even notice it at first. When I did, it made me first think of the picture of Olympic rower Henrik Rummel, and secondly made me realise the girls had all already seen it including all the elderly people sitting for the bus. I desparately tried to cover it with my book, The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, but to no avail.

We delayed getting together, although we still had sex and saw each other all the time (we were basically dating, just openly). He said he'd wait for me, although I told him not to. It was really great, and we had no issues.\n\nThis lasted about five months. Until I started to be ready to date him. Then he tells me that he doesn't actually want to date anybody, ever. Well... personally, I think he's incorrect. He told me nobody's ever made him happier, and until this we were really, really awesome. But whatever. If he doesn't want to date me, that's that. We sort of sloppily half-broke up for two months after that, and we've been in separate cities for the last month. We're moving back into the same neighbourhood next week.\n\nHowever, my feelings are/were not gone, and every time I talk to him or think about him, I think about how happy I would be with him and how much he hurt me, etc. I'm perfectly happy if we don't interact, but miserable if we do. But we were really good friends before we essentially dated, and all of my close friends are his close friends. I'd prefer not to have to lose all of those friends to avoid him, and I'd like to be friends again. Also, he's going to be in the play I'm going to be in, so I'll have to see him all the time at rehearsals. My question is how do I stop feeling all these things when I see him?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been moody, and irritable, and just... unhappy.\n\nIt turns out, I was 3 months pregnant. That explained a lot. My SO and don't want kids now, or anytime in the future. We have horrible genetics and are far from being financially sound enough to be raising kids.\n\nRoughly two weeks after discovering I was pregnant, I had an abortion. This was about two-ish weeks ago. My boyfriend expected my to go back to my happy-go-lucky state again. Honestly, so did I. Yet, I didn't.\n\nThe first week after my abortion I was an emotional wreck. I don't regret my decision to abort, but for some reason, I was having a really hard time. I do suffer from depression, so I that probably had a bit to do with it.\n\nNow, I've been trying really hard to be the girl I was before any of this happened. There has just been so much stress.

Being me, I didn't have a nickname nor did I like anything people called me. So I decided I wanted to make up a nickname myself and put it in my jersey. \n\nTaking influence from The Maestro from Seinfeld, I called myself the D-Meister; the \"d\" representing the first letter of my first name because \"i am the best of being me\". Remember, I was in high school. \n\nEight months and $85 Australian Dollars later and I got my high school jersey, however, during the eight months in limbo for the jersey, the internet had created a new joke/meme about sex and penises. The punchline in this joke was \"She got/wants the D!\", the \"D\" representing penises. So flashforward to me opening my jersey; I open the plastic and written on the back of the jersey is \"D-Meister\" and I was utterly confused because I had completely forgot what I had put on it. \n\nI then took it for a test ride and of course, people were shouting \"She got the D!\", \"You are the best at dicks\", \"DDDDDDDDDDD-MEEEIIIISSTAAAA\", and the list goes on.\nTL;DR:"}

We had to submit or choice for master's thesis. I got my hands on a subject related to NMR imaging. Sadly my promoter / advisor came down with a bad case of not responding to emails. But considering it was during the exams I decided to wait, most professors simply don't respond to emails during the exams. Today I decided to inquire about the situation and it turns out he's most likely sick for a couple of months. Now this wouldn't be a problem if there was somebody else who actually had any idea about the subject of my thesis. Sadly it turns out that there are very few people on this planet who are even doing research into the specific subject. Due to the complexity of the task at hand it's impossible to continue even with the help of other professors and assistants.\n\nI got several other suggestions, but sadly none of them are of a very high level and are actually rather easy. While this might sound like a dream for a lot of people for me it isn't. These subjects would never pass under normal conditions cause they're too easy, and I really can't accept them as I wish to apply to a Ph.D. program after I finished my master's degree. And who is going to accept somebody into their Ph.D. program that did a master's thesis on microcontroller development boards? (I sure as hell wouldn't.)\n\nSo my choices currently are:\n1) Take something from the list of easy boring subjects that doesn't interest me at all combined with ruining my career chances.\n2) Go for an ICT subject.\n3) Purpose my own idea.\n\nThe only acceptable option for me seems to be purposing my own idea. But there is a little problem with that, I have until Thursday to submit my idea it seems. I normally wouldn't ask other people to help me with this but I really don't have time due to the exams.\nTL;DR:"}

After ending things with him, he has begged for another chance, promising to do everything I always asked of him.

On the drive to school I asked him, \"So what'd you make for lunch?\" He simply responded, \"peanut butter and jelly.\" I then dropped him off and went to school myself. Later, when we both got home from school, I walked into the kitchen and saw bread, peanut butter, and K-Y jelly on the counter. At first I wondered why it was there and then with a sinking feeling in my stomach it hit me. My little brother made a peanut butter and K-Y jelly sandwich.

During that two hours I didn't just stand around, she would say \"so here it says what table they are at so you bring it there\" and I would deliver the food. Not hard stuff, but work nonetheless. \n\nThe second half of the time they had me do some jobs that didn't really take explanation. I cleaned both women and men's bathrooms, windex-ed the doors/windows around the place, filled buckets of ice and put them in the pop machine, bussed tables, etc. Again, not hard, but nothing I would want to do for no reason. \n\nI kept bringing up the fact that I hadn't clocked in, or that when I left I never clocked out. Every time I did I either got ignored (as in they would bring something else up) or they gave some vague answer of \"Oh we will show you how to do that next time.\" Didn't want to be rude my first day so I let it slide, but as I was going home I was thinking to myself that it was odd. I used to work at a Wendy's and my first day there was sitting down watching training videos for four hours and I got paid. \n\nI told my friends and  they basically said well yeah that is pretty much expected and the economy is bad and that you should just not think about it and not ruin your job opportunity. Also they claimed that since I was being trained I wasn't an important asset to the crew at that point since things took me longer, I had to ask questions, etc. \n\nNormally this would be fine with me, but the fact that I was on a knee washing a toilet kind of changes my mind. I don't do that for free. \n\nAnyway, is this common? Is this a policy? Is it moral?\nTL;DR:"}

I go down on her a lot and finger her pretty much every time we are in the mood and the ONLY thing she is comfortable with doing to me is handjobs. It's great and all but it gets boring.

Amanda has been gone on vacation to her relatives place, and last night Emily wanted to hang out. I went to her house and after a few laughs and playful gestures we kiss. It was the most amazing kiss I've had in years. I kiss her everywhere and we can't let go of each other. I think she wanted to take it further but I couldn't, but we kept cuddling. We were so happy to be there together and I haven't felt a connection like that in years. I feel like poop and I don't know what to do from here.. should I just move on from that and be better to Amanda? I'm lost.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [21 M] think that my ex-girlfriend [21 F] has misdiagnosed herself with a chronic illness. Do I tell her?\nPOST: My ex-girlfriend, who broke up with me 8 months ago and hasn't talked to me since, is sick. She found a chronic illness that matched her symptoms, and began treating for it. She never consulted a doctor on the diagnosis or the course of treatment. The treatment made her healthier, and from what I hear has continued to do so since our break-up.\n\nWhile doing some research (don't ask why), I discovered that she might have misdiagnosed herself. A different pair of chronic illnesses, according to my research, fits better, for three reasons:\n\n1) She had no test to prove her current self-diagnosis, and what I believe is at least as likely, if not more likely.\n\n2) If you include other aspects of her anatomy and physiology as symptoms, rather than coincidences as she does, then my theory is an even stronger match.\n\n3) The treatment she has been self-prescribing would actually treat many of the more obvious symptoms of my diagnosis.\n\nThe last bit is, I'm not sure if she'll get worse. It's possible that she'll just continue to feel good as long as she keeps treating herself (which she could theoretically do), but it's also possible that she could make one of my proposed illnesses worse. Her life does not hang in the balance. \n\nI do know that I don't particularly care for her. I'm neutral. But starting and then having this conversation would be incredibly stressful and likely just devolve into some argument, which I do not want to deal with. There is no reason for her to expect communication from me.\n\nDo I tell her?\nTL;DR:"}

A couple of weeks ago my ex boyfriend and I decided to mutually break up. We weren't communicating, had barely anything in common and I felt like the relationship wasn't going anywhere. I cried a little bit, but it wasn't as emotional as any previous break ups I've had.\n\nI have already started to see a close friend exclusively and couldn't be happier with my choice. He doesn't feel like a rebound to me, and he has said the same thing. I feel like I moved on from the relationship a long time ago, but I just didn't have the courage to break up because I didn't have a good reason to. My ex was the best boyfriend I've had until this point, even when the relationship had many flaws.\n\nI have been reflecting on it a lot recently and kind of realized I should have broke it off a lot sooner. He never communicated with me, and when I brought it up he didn't do anything about it. I gave him tons of chances, but again, nothing happened.\n\nI guess I'm just feeling a little bit confused since this was an odd break up compared to my last three boyfriends. It was quick, and mutual. And although he wanted to talk about it after the fact and get me back, I wanted nothing to do with him. Usually I'd be the one asking for the second chance and not eating because of high emotional stress, and crying. I cried for 2 minutes, and then ate dinner.\nTL;DR:"}

I wouldn't even be in the core engineering program, I even got into an advanced program where aerospace and nanotechnology were taught at the undergrad level. \n\nI finished my first semester in December, and hated every minute of it. 80 hour weeks, insane pacing, and just a pile of theoretical math and math and math. While my program had an admission average of over 95%, the averages last semester were right on 3.0. I fell right near here. While I got a couple 90's in the classes I actually liked, I couldn't keep up with the 5 other math classes, and wound up with a 2.93, with a D+ dragging the whole average down. \n\nI know I'm not an idiot, my SAT's and high school marks back that up, but I feel I cannot do as well here as I would like. I cannot keep up with the pace of some classes, and just have no interest in a lot of the material. \n\nI was debating when I applied to University about whether to go into medicine or into Engineering, and think I made the wrong choice. I still love biology, I love the lab work that I have gotten to do, and think that is more where my interests lie. My school allows students to switch into Arts and Science, but I am very worried. This first year is still going to be on my transcript, and medical school admissions are extremely tight. I have already tried to see if I can retake the class I did worst in, or just restart from my first year and pretend this never happened, but I cannot. \n\nSo, do I have any chance of getting into a good medical school if I switched into a biology degree from my second year on, with a first year GPA likely in the very low 3's, assuming I do very will in my upper years? Am I better off just switching schools entirely, possibly having to leave the country to get rid of that transcript, and taking my undergraduate elsewhere? Am I already screwed at this point?\nTL;DR:"}

The argument itself was not something important really and it'd barely began when suddenly he ended things. Mind you, he's not the best person dealing with conflict. He immediately broke down crying saying he really loved me, how afraid he was of of he'd just said. We ended up kissing. I went to my place and we kept talking on facebook.

He would say he wanted some time to think about his decision but still flirted with me, talked to me like before and didn't told any of our mutual friends, even when he had the opportunity. It was just like being in a relationship but without the physical contact. He came to have lunch in my house a few days after and proceeded to lay down in my bed just like he used to and asked for cuddles. I was weak and obliged. \n\nTwo days ago and went again to his house to get some of my things and we ended up embracing, kissing and making love. He also told me the break-up was hard. \nThe same night, I decided to confront him and demanded a choice: either he admits he's confused and takes some time and space to start missing me and deciding if he wants to get back together or just says he doesn't want to be with me at all and we'd cut off all contact.\n\nHe confessed he loved me and was completely confused about breaking up and agreed that a bit of time and space would be nice to clear up his mind.

Holidays and birthdays were always very fake, and more often than not turned into drunken battles.  His own birthday was especially difficult because it was a day he couldn't manage to fly under the radar and his family turned it into an opportunity to make him feel guilty for, well, existing.  It was as if he personally were to blame for making the day about him.\n\nAs a result, he's not the biggest fan now.  I understand this, even though these things have always been happy occasions for my family.  I also give him credit for realizing occasions are a big deal to me and participating with my family on holidays and making me always feel very special on my own birthday.\n\nNow his birthday is coming up in a few weeks and, per usual, he's shrugged it off by saying \"it's just a day.\"  I'd be inclined to take the hint, tamp down my own excitement and let it pass, but on several occasions he's let it slip how special it was when I hunted down his favorite wine and cake for his birthday a few years ago (we weren't dating yet, we were involved in a theatre project together and I brought the wine and cake to rehearsal one night).\n\nOur lines of communication are pretty dang open, this is a topic however that he's inclined to dodge and I'm left with some mixed messages.

I'm afraid that I've pretty much doomed us by even entertaining these thoughts. I still enjoy our time together, he still feels like my favourite person in the world, we still talk and have sex and it's mostly awesome. We still butt heads over stupid crap sometimes. \n\nIt's not like I'm faking anything. It's hard to even pinpoint what's changed (pretty sure it's just me) but I *think* I feel marginally different about him...not in magnitude, but in quality. I look at him sometimes and it's like I'm seeing a friend more than a romantic partner. Part of me is convinced that's pretty natural after 3 years, but it still freaks me out.\n\nAll this angst and ambivalence seems to be coming to a head. I am not a sentimental person, RA.

She had never been with anyone before in a serious way and I had never really been with the right woman, a good woman that is to say. We fell in the kind of love that makes it seem like the universe is smiling down on you. It was the best thing that ever happened in my life. She was studying for the bar, I supported her through it and through the first few months of her job at law school. Things started to get tough when she was working 70-80 hour weeks, I was extremely supportive but she was clearly unhappy with her job and it made her distant from everything, her friends, family, and me. Then a few weeks ago she said she'd looked around at her friends all getting married and she wanted to make sure that I was the right man for her life. I told her I completely understood how she was feeling and that it's terrible to be trapped, I don't want to stand in the way of her happiness. Still, it completely tore my life apart. Two weeks on and I can't stop thinking about her, can't eat/sleep well. Sometimes she calls to tell me she's thinking about me, she always tells me she loves me. She is certain this is something she has to do. Now, from everything my friends tell me this is basically the end of the relationship. I should let go and just let her go live her life.

However, when I was younger I was sexually and verbally abused by family members. My highschool sweetheart and I were together for 4 years, with him constantly cheating on me with my friends. Because of this I find it hard to trust anyone.\n\nOur relationship is the first serious one for my boyfriend. I find it so hard to trust him when he goes out without me. I'm not dependent on him, but I'm suspicious of everything. He made a plan to go to Europe for 3 weeks with his friends that dislike me and tell him to break up with me all the time. I don't think I am mentally strong enough to handle him being away that long and not knowing what is going on.\n\nMy depression fluctuates and I'm just not feeling like myself anymore. He looks out for me and tries to be comforting but he can't understand because he is not depressed or had the same life experiences as me. He was always super attentive to me, but I feel like my depression is pushing him away because it stresses him out too. I want to try and trust him and work on things but now he's starting to get so frustrated. I could use some advice on how to not screw things up and learn to trust someone for the first time.\nTL;DR:"}

This was the second time he put his hands on me - the first time was in a choking manner without much real force, but executed with real menace. \n\nHe originally pled guilty to the charges of Disorderly Conduct - DV and Assault - DV. However, I assume after consulting a lawyer, he changed his plea to not guilty. My advocate urged me to allow an offering of a plea deal. He told me that a conviction would be difficult, the process of trials would be long, and would make things harder on me in the long run. I took his advice, insisting that his plea include Domestic Violence. He accepted the plea on the condition that he complete Domestic Violence counseling, he was assessed a measly fine of $350.00 and was ordered to pay for my eyeglasses that he broke as well as my doctor bills. \n\nHe paid the fine, I received the money I was owed, and to my knowledge he did begin counseling. But he told me himself that the counseling was a joke and he stopped going. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and 8 months later, the warrant has been quashed. It makes me sick to know that he went virtually unpunished for hurting me so badly. My world was turned upside down for so long because of what he did. We had lived together, so all of my belongings except for my clothes stayed with him. Televisions. Electronics. Furniture. I moved 2 hours away to live with my parents, so I was without work. I lost weight, developed a drinking problem for about 4 months, some days I would sit in my room with the shades drawn and just lay there, not moving, for entire days. \n\nIsn't there any way to seek justice for what he did?

Her birthday was recently and I chose to stay with her rather than go to his place to spend the night(which i had said i would do earlier that day).

I don't care if you usually just read these things, do me a favor and just submit your opinion. \n\nMe and my gf have a great relationship. We click. We're definitely compatible. However, we're in a slight crisis at the moment. She has been accepted into her graduate program at FSU for spring. I'm at another university. FSU denied me. She is leaving regardless, and I'm still about halfway through my bachelors degree in Finance. There's no way I can take online classes there, but she wants me to go regardless. This has been a cause of a lot of arguing between us. She doesn't understand my perspective that she isn't willing to stay for me, but I'm supposed to drop my entire life here for her over there, without the ability to pursue my degree. The shitty part is that she could pursue her graduate program at the university we both currently live by (and received our undergraduate education from), but wants to leave because FSU offers a better one. \n\nI understand the tendency will be to say this is a cut and dry \"how do you feel\" scenario and I should just decide whether or not she's worth leaving everything behind for, but I'd like a little feedback from people who have either been in this situation before or have some insight into why I should go or why not.\nTL;DR:"}

When/how should I tell her?\nPOST: My best friend (both F/25) have known each other for about 10 years and are extremely close even though we currently live in different cities. I have always felt included with her family and I get along particularly well with her mom. However, until about two months ago I had little to no contact with her brother (M/27).\n\nWhile I had a bit of a crush on the brother when I was a teenager, I moved on from that as we had never had a real conversation that went beyond pleasantries. However two months ago a series of random occurrences led to us becoming facebook friends. This led to us chatting regularly and a month ago we met and had coffee in person for the first time.\n\nHe and I have a lot in common and get along extremely well. Since then we've gone on a number of dates and it's obviously starting to get serious.\n\nI initially decided not to say anything to my best friend because I wanted to see if there was anything between her brother and I before getting everyone else involved in it. However, it's getting to a point where I'm starting to feel guilty about not telling her.\n\nI'm a bit worried that she'll be upset I didn't tell her sooner. I know she'll be pretty ecstatic about the whole situation in general (she's always joked about how her brother and I are super alike). However, I want to make sure she understands that I didn't keep it from her with any malicious intent.\nTL;DR:"}

When we met, I was always a bigger guy, having been an athlete and dedicated to health, but I always carried a little weight as well (you can see the outline of my abdominals faintly). She tells me she doesn't like skinny guys, but doesn't like overly muscular bodies either. \n\nI have had this stupid \"four year plan\" since where I go on cuts in the summer and maintain my macro nutrients the rest of the year to have energy to focus on school. With two years down, I have lost 22lbs from where I started and my strength and conditioning has definitely gone up.\n\nRecently, she has been commenting that I should make my arms bigger, but also sometimes that I should lose more weight. Honestly, it does make me self conscious sometimes when she does say that, and I have told her so. She recently has joined the Greek life, and I feel like she may be comparing me to other guys she has seen.\n\nIronically enough, my girlfriend is almost the opposite to me when it comes to health. If I am eating chicken and rice for lunch, she'll most likely will be eating mac and cheese. She has a bit of fat on her as well, but is definitely not overweight and I love her body. I never bring up her eating habits, but the few times I have, has been because she comments on feeling sick and I will mention eating better food that is nutritious. \n\nThis is more of a rant but, it bothers me that my GF comments on my body, to get bigger but lose weight (very, very hard to do at the same time), what does Relationships think?\nTL;DR:"}

Even if it's played for humour, the majority of people I see go for the pessimistic outlook and say overly cynical things, rather then find something good, or optimistic to focus on.\nI'm just wondering if theres a cultural reason, or if it's just the way the majority of people are fine-tuned...

But others with the same style of life would rather complain about it (I'm talking broad strokes here, I can't believe that everyone who bitches about their life is really leading a terrible life filled with abuse and hatred, the occasional person yeah, but not everyone), it just feels like people need to complain about something rather then see the good they have.  \n  \nAs for the online community, I know about the Anonymity factor and the fact that you can say pretty much anything without repercussions... but why would you want to? Why belittle someone, when you don't need to? Why look down on a persons accomplishments, rather then celebrate them or your own?

He is fine with our dog, but last night we took him with us to my parents house, and he immediately was lunging and barking aggressively towards my parents 10 year old jack Russell. She was basically ignoring him, and showed no aggression back. Could this be simply because he is not neutered? I have heard males can be more aggressive towards each other when one or both are not neutered but I am not sure if this explains his aggression. He has been nothing but sweet and docile in every other situation, including when my dog snapped at him because he was getting too close to his rawhide.

We have been close friends for 6 years. \n\nToday, i told my GF i would Skype her after i got out of the shower. While i was in the shower she sent me a text and a snapchat. i replied to the text and snap when i got out and i continued communicating using those two means.  i completely forgot i told her that i would Skype her.  I got a call about an hour after i got out of the shower with her upset that i never Skyped her and that her saying she is always the one to initiate the phone call.\n\nThe truth is that she usually does call me.  She is in her 3rd year of nursing school and she spends the majority of her time studying. I on the other hand work from about 5 am to 4 pm every week day and spend the rest of my time with leisure activities. Out of respect for her schooling i dont call her while she studies, i wait for her to call me when she takes breaks. It seems this had had a negative effect on her since she thinks that me not initiating hardly any phone calls means i am not putting any effort into our relationship.\n\nMe forgetting to Skype turned into an hour long argument about how she feels like im not trying in our relationship then the fight changed topics like 3 more times.\nTL;DR:"}

From what I've gathered she was very insecure (cheated on and also abused) and quick to pick fights. \n\nBecause even though i love my SO to bits, its getting to me. I feel like i'm sort of forced to make everything sort of funny or explain myself in a egg-shell-walking-manner so he doesn't get bummed out. Both of us are easy going, and are goofy as hell together. We get shit done, but avoid conflict like the plague.

He basically avoids that conversation until hes sure the coast is clear and i usually end up apologizing and trying to explain what i meant but it still takes the entire damn day. I feel like i'm dealing with behaviors he picked up in the last relationship and I just want to stomp around yelling \"ARRR DUDE I AM NOT HER!! FOR FUCKS SAAKE\" <- sure this would work.

As soon as I found out, I immediately apologized to him, but since his memory/conversing was pretty bad I don't think he ever truly understood what I was saying, even though he did reply. I'm still so sorry to this day. Now even when I tell him I love him, all he can do is just stare at me. The nurses from Hospice think that he might pass soon. I have no idea how to know if my dad knows how sorry I am for everything. I also don't know how to enjoy time with him since I can't even talk to him, or make new memories with him.

J and I stayed in touch loosely through fb and random texts but none of a romantic nature. At the start of football season I decided I wanted to go up for a game and J had always told me I was welcome to \"crash\" at his place. I took him up on the offer and even brought a pillow and stuff to crash on his couch like he said. One thing led to another and we ended up hooking up that night and most of the weekend.

I understand monotony is boring and I am not a super needy person but are her issues valid?\n\nHer fear is we may not be compatible because I am such a giving unconditional person and she can be selfish and may not be able to reciprocate for my needs.

I want to give her space when she needs it but do not want her to take advantage of it and not reciprocate. \n\nMy thought overall is that we both are compatible and these differences are things we can both hopefully learn from and adopt the better qualities of their extremes. I could be more independent and take space for myself giving her space in the same time and she could be more observant and selfless for my needs as well. Basically a balance of our extreme personality examples. Any advice or similar experiences?  Overall I believe our communication to be great and a passionate relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

Once, when I was taking the washing off the line I had one fall on my hand. Then two others walked very fast next to or towards my bare feet. My best was when a dead spider fell down the front of my shirt, pausing briefly on its way down to wave hello and brush against my cheek. So I should know better.\nNevertheless I think I'll be a rational human being and realize it is just a hair. I brush my hand over the back of my neck and feel the loose hair pull over my shoulder. So I was right there was a hair. But that doesn't mean there isn't a spider, which is something I neglected to consider.\nThen I'm inside and the hair that isn't there now starts moving quickly up my back. I turn my head and what do you know. There is a big brown compact looking spider sitting on my shoulder. It may as well have been waving and saying \"well, looks like you screwed that one up\".\nBecause it was so close to my face I tried to blow it off my shoulder, which worked very well.

This has been evident even from a very early age (I'm talking, kindergarten years.) I can remember the first time this was really a problem. The teacher was telling my parents that I had a huge problem with concentration. Well, this would continue all the way up through today. I'd be able to get things done, but with much slower progress because of my extreme lack of concentration. I was diagnosed with ADD and we started medication around grade 2 or 3. From then on it had become a little easier with the help of my parents to stay on track. In recent weeks, I thought maybe this isn't a condition, maybe it's just me being lazy. Maybe if I just push myself a little harder to get things done, I won't have a problem. Well, I tried to do just that and... lets just say that the results were less than promising. I took my meds today and had an immensely noticeable difference. This should probably have me feeling productive as hell, but instead it has left me feeling ashamed that I can't do this on my own. I understand that this is why I am on these medications, but I just want to feel like I can do things on my own. Understood if nobody wants to read about me wallowing in self-pity, but I just wanted to know if anybody has had similar feelings and how they deal with it.\nTL;DR:"}

I let her come in and I texted my girlfriend right away to let her know what was going on and I tried to get in contact with one of my exes friends but since I don't have Facebook I couldn't message anyone and I couldn't get into her phone for anyone's numbers. During all of this she was in the bathroom puking and sleeping with her head in the toilet. I had no idea where she was living since we broke up two years ago so I couldn't just call a cab and send her home so I just let her sleep it off in my bathroom, thinking that it was the responsible thing to do. I texted my girlfriend again to tell her this was happening but since she was asleep she wasn't seeing my messages. \n\nToday I drove my ex home before I went to work and figured everything would be good but my girlfriend is pissed off and thinks I cheated and just said that to cover up any clues she might find that my ex was there. There's not any way I can prove that I didn't do what should I do? I'm not gonna let her berate me because of something she thinks I did, and tbh I would want any of her exes to let her stay the night too if she showed up that drunk.\nTL;DR:"}

The gas station is at the top of a hill, so we walked our bikes there. After buying some snacks and what not, we decide it's time to go home. As we are going down the hill, my older cousin accelerates past me, looks back, and laughs at me. Not backing down from the challenge, I speed up to pass him as he stopped pedaling. Once I pass him, he starts peddling again and right before he passes me I peddle as hard as I can.\n \nMind you, none of us have brakes on our bikes, and we are in the middle of the road. As soon as I start accelerating, my chain slips and I go crashing down into the pavement.\n \nI had my phone in my hand while holding onto the handlebars. My 2 week old iPhone 6s+ got the worst of the crash (along with me knee) and was completely shattered. If I had my phone in my pocket, I wouldn't have to be typing this on my old iPhone 4 :(\n \nWhat may be the worst part about it, is the fact that we snuck out, so I couldn't tell my mom what happened. I told her that I raged while playing a video game and threw my phone at the wall. So they think that I am even more irresponsible than I actually am.

We set up a chain outside for her that reaches into our garage, where her food, water, and kennel are. It's not very warm, as the floor is just dirt and mot cemented and it's not a heated garage. My mom's garage door is also jammed open, so closing it up isn't much of an option. \n\nWhen I moved to the Twin Cities for college late summer 2011 (I was only gone 10 months; on really cold winter nights mom would bring her inside and stick her in my old room), mom quit bringing her in at night and she lost her kennel training, so she whimpers almost all night and frankly doesn't like being inside longer than 5 hours period now. She stays outside now but I do take her for long walks once to twice a day, depending on my schedule. \n\nAnyway, when I try covering her kennel (her pet carrier that's two sizes too big on purpose and outfitted with a fluffy comfy pillow) with a blanket, she yanks it off and tears it apart. At this time of year I don't like leaving her outside because her winter coat hasn't come in yet and I feel extremely guilty about having to leave her outside. I do fill her food bowl an extra time every day to help raise her calorie intake and help with natural warmth, but I still worry. Does anyone have any tips or tricks to help with this issue until we move amd don't have my mother's iron fist ruling over us?\nTL;DR:"}

We fooled around but we both agreed that we were drunk and things between us were moving faster than they should be.\n\nThe reason I say things were moving faster than they should be is because she just got out of a 2 year relationship.

So its hard for me to put myself in her place.\n\nLast Monday night (party night) before we all started drinking she pulled me to the side and kissed me, but then told me she wanted to take things slow. I understood the whole situation or at least tried to because I haven't been in her shoes before, but she is definately still getting over the breakup.\n\nNow about 2 days ago she really held off the talking. I didn't hear from her for almost a day and a half (unlike her). She finally did tell me that she is confused and didn't know what to think and that she isn't ready for anything yet.

I worry that should something happen and we break up I'll have no support base/friendships.\n\nHave you been in a similar situation? How did you manage to step out of you comfort zone?\nTL;DR:"}

We met up five times during the summer (we were really busy, gone for weeks at a time).\nWe don't have a ton of time to spend time together now that school has started (we are both in sports after school), but I was hoping that at least when I got my drivers licence (in about 2 weeks) we could go out on the weekend.\n\nAnyways, we hung out after school on Tuesday for 45 minutes and just walked around talking before sports practice. Wednesday night I texted her asking if she wanted to spend lunch or the after school period on Thursday together and she responded something like \"wtf we just hung out Tuesday\". She had also previously (a few days before) said she was busy on the weekend (going to a concert) so I knew I wouldn't be able to see her that weekend.\nI don't want to transcribe the whole conversation, but basically she wants a really casual relationship. She said she doesn't want/need to/have time to hang out a lot... the \"doesn't want to\" and harshness of her tone really set me off and after a little more back and forth I said something along the lines that I wanted something more serious and couldn't stand being able to see her for only an hour a week. I can understand her wanting to hang out with her friends but she definitely phrased it more harsh than that.\n\nWhat I can't escape is that she never said she didn't want to date, she never said she didn't like me, she just wanted something casual. And instead of working with that I got caught up in wanting more faster and now I feel I just fucked everything up. Seeing her once a week is better than nothing, and over time that could have developed into something more serious. In other words at least there was hope in that scenario.\n\nI have been obsessed with this girl for months (still am) and I'm not sure I can live with this feeling that I fucked it up.\nTL;DR:"}

However that relationship grew and I talked her several months after, asking whether anything changed between us. Essentially we were the same as before, friends but closer than that. Then we made out recently, but a couple of days later, she said she wanted to tone it down and hang out on the more mellow side. Keep in mind I still had a thing for her, but not to the point where I was obsessed; it probably just enhanced our relationship.\n\nThen she contacted me couple of weeks ago saying she wants to hang out again, I agreed. Now, I was also hanging out with this other girl at the time, and we both pretty much clicked - to the point I got into a relationship with her. I then told my other friend about what was happening and I wanted to tone it down, she basically flipped her shit and ended our close friendship.\n\nNow, Im annoyed and quite hurt at this, because honestly I thought for a while that she wanted to remain friends, and her telling me to tone it down a couple days after we kissed pretty much confirmed that.

I've never had a serious relationship with a girl, and last summer, I met a girl from work. We became very, very close, and ended up spending the summer together. We were inseprable. I'd never felt so happy and content with myself. It turned into one of the best summers I've ever had. We were always telling each other how much we liked one another. We were dreading the end of the summer.\n\nThe big problem is that I decided to take a gap year before college, in Europe. The second the summer ended, I was gone. Jane said that she wanted to keep in touch everyday, and I was more than happy to do so. We kept in touch nearly everyday via Facebook message and text, skyping only a few times. We always talked about how great it would be when I got back from Europe, and how much we missed each other. That started around August last year, and had been going on up until about two months ago, in April. I was making the majority of the effort to stay in touch all year, and it seemed that she genuinely wanted to keep in touch and liked talking. Come April, she pretty much just stopped. The Facebook messages stopped, and whenever I texted Jane, it was very clear that she wasn't interested in talking. Whenever we did text, it was always all about her. I'd ask all the questions, and she'd usually respond with one word answers. So rarely did she ask even so much as, \"how's your day been?\" There were some other instances where it was extremely apparent that she was distancing herself from me.\n\nI get back from Europe in a week. I've been waiting to see her all year, and now I'm freaking out, because it seems very obvious that she isn't even interested in communicating. I've given up putting forth effort because I'm so sick of the one way street. Does all this mean that she's completely uninterested in being with me this summer? Sorry if this is very convoluted and rambling, I've never written a post before.\nTL;DR:"}

He stopped talking to me after we talked that it's not going to happen.\n\nWe didn't talk for awhile but we returned to being friends. We even hooked up, but it didn't work out afterwards due to complications. Ever since then we both seem to be dating someone or not single at the same time. I'm terrified that we unintentionally put ourselves into the friend zone. But I feel that we still like each other, we spend so much time sometimes, we talk for hours and only recently I've been cutting it shorter cause I'm afraid of doing something stupid. In hopes of breaking the cycle, I stopped dating completely early this year. It's been rough.\n\nI want to tell him that I like him, but I don't want to disrupt our friendship again. (Because we don't talk for weeks when it happens) It also turns out I'm going out of town and he's going to the same place around the same time and we're planning to meet up and hang out while traveling. I don't want to make any waves that'll affect the trip (it's soon) - but my friends are pushing me to tell him my feelings again. \n\nI mean, I only have my gut feeling that we still like each other, also I think he knows that we like each other (we give each other gifts, and we go eat dinner often etc). I could be horribly wrong about it. I know he's casually dating someone right now and I know he likes her. \n\nMaybe I should give up for the hundredth time and date someone else only to realize I'm in love my friend, while he figures out I'm causally dating when he's not and we stop talking for few weeks until we go back to being friends.

Having settled down to sleep for about twenty minutes, we begin to hear a scratching noise at the door. I ignore it for a minute or two but it continues, and eventually the handle slowly slides down and a figure topples through the doorway.

Clearly realising that he is in the wrong place but obviously incapable of doing anything about it, he proceeds to curl into a ball on the floor, pull down his pants and then piss for about a minute and a half, all over my girlfriends carpet. We then wake up her housemate, who drags him into the hallway where he carries on pissing for around another minute. He then tries to re-enter the room, naked from the waste down and shouting \"it doesn't even matter!\" and other, slightly less coherent phrases.

It was fun, we got to chat a little, but there were a few moments of silence as well. \n\nAfter the date, I dropped her off at home, and she said that she had fun and wanted to do it again sometime, I was surprised that she said this because of her demeanor. I was doubting that she liked me more than a friend, and this was clearly a date in hindsight, there is no mistaking it. \n\nWhat is causing me the most doubt is that chatting (via skype, mms, etc) between games is very sporadic.

We have maintained what i consider a good friendship for the last year since we split (as well as seeing each other intimately on and off over the course of this year).\n\nThe thing is she tells me that she still loves me and I have to admit that my feelings for her haven't changed either.  We have both tried seeing other people but it hasn't worked out for either of us.  \n\nI'm comfortable being just friends with this girl but when were together our connection is strong so there's always sexual tension when we hang out (she initiates), which isn't that often since were both busy with school.  \n\nMy dilemma is that the last time i saw her she told me she wished that i would just ignore her when she tries to contact me so that she will think i have moved on and then hopefully she can.  I've always been there for her when she needed me and I don't think i have it in me to just cut her out of my life.  I see no point in ruining a friendship with someone who I consider to be a great person and a true friend.  \n\nI know that women think much more emotionally than men and i have no idea why she would want this.

I put izy down on a table which she promptly used to jump the fence and escape as well. \ni'm thinking this is all fine, we'll just catch her like the other one, but unfortunately she got out the front where the road is.

I'm a 22 year old university student dating a 19 year old university student. I recently got into a relationship with her in July. It's my first relationship since I've always been an awkward kind of guy, so I was ecstatic when I asked her out and she said yes. \n\nThe problem is this. My girlfriend is Indian, and comes from a very strict background. Her parents are incredibly protective of her, and forbid her from even hanging out with guys in public, because they think all men are horndogs. She says she likes me, but tells me that our relationship has no future. The reason for this is because I'm not Indian myself, so her parents would never accept me. I suggested that I would fight for their approval, but she doesn't want to risk having her family hate her for this. So now that I know that I can't really ever be with my gf, what should I do? I can't even treat her like my girlfriend in public, because of her family friends of relatives seeing her with a guy. In fact, I've barely seen her recently, because her mother thinks something's up. I might just be overly sensitive, but it really hurts, knowing this.\nTL;DR:"}

We grew up together, essentially, and until now I thought I she was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Within the past couple of years, I became very depressed (and still am). Admittedly, I was probably not a very nice person to be around, let alone date, and things got very strained between us as a result of me shitty attitude and self destructive behavior.\n\nShe broke up with me about 6 weeks ago. Some time during this stint apart (not long after ending the relationship) she decided she wanted to be more than just friends with this guy friend of hers (who she met about 7 months ago at school). We kept in touch a bit during our time apart, because we wanted to remain friends. I asked her if there was anything between her and \"friend\", and she lied and said there wasn't. From what I understand they made out 8-10 times, and eventually progressed to oral. Apparently, the whole thing ended rather abruptly with the guy saying something along the lines of \"alright, I'm done with this, let's just be friends again\". A few nights ago, we started talking again, and we've decided to give it another try.\n\nMy problem is that she, a normally very conservative girl, doesn't even feel bad about being used the way she was, and even wants to still be friends and hang out with this guy. In my opinion, he took advantage of her during a very emotionally vulnerable time, and only decided he didn't want to keep going when he realized she wasn't going to have sex with him. I can't stand the idea of this guy hanging around her, and she doesn't see anything wrong with it. I haven't stopped thinking about this since I found out about it, and it's tearing me apart. I feel betrayed, and I've lost a lot of respect for her. Can anyone give me some insight? I'm completely lost.\nTL;DR:"}

I lived in Sacramento, he lives in Union City, which is a good four hours away from Sacramento. I don't really see my old friends and I haven't actually made any new ones since I don't have a job and am not taking any classes right now. The only people I see on a daily basis are his parents(because they live like 2 blocks away and he's a momma's boy) and his friends, who come over all the time. I don't really have much in common with most of his friends, since they're all guys, love sports and certain video games that I don't play. So I usually feel pretty left out whenever they come over because I don't ever know what they're talking about, have nothing to contribute, and they don't make a big effort to include me in their conversations. But one of his friends, lets call him Carl, is more of a dork, and I actually get along really well with him. He usually talks to me about the girl he's into at the moment, or we go out to get some food or some coffee. So he's basically the only friend I have in this city. Any way, this morning my boyfriend tells me that he's been talking to his parents and that his mom thinks that I'm spending too much time with Carl, and that they think he's trying to come on to me. At this point I get really mad because I've only actually been alone with him like 3 times, and the only reason we ever end up hanging out alone is because my boyfriend doesn't want whatever food or drink we're going to get. Every other time I'm with him, my boyfriend is there. And my boyfriend completely trusts me and Carl. They've been friends since like, the second grade and that's just not the type of guy he is.

As usual, I get stuck in the backseat and he starts surfing radio stations to find something he deems worthy. All along, talking over anything I say and just generally being a jerk. Then I realize: I have radio controls in the backseat! \n\nEvery time he found a station he liked, I would either crank the volume WAY UP or wayyyyy down. I would stop for a few minutes, and then start up again...just to see him relax and then get mad again. After 10 minutes, he is screaming in rage at the radio \"What the fuck is wrong with this thing...\" blah blah blah. \n\nEvery time it hit a station I liked, I would stop, or only make tiny volume adjustments. Took him half an hour to figure it out. I got in tons of trouble with my parents, did not care at all. Laughed all the way to the hotel.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by starting a pantsing war with my fianc\u00e9\nPOST: It all started yesterday morning around 9. While she was folding laundry at the kitchen table, I had the bright idea to \"pants\" her. I casually walked up behind her as to give her a sweet embrace when suddenly I yanked down her sweatpants exposing her Sunday morning delicates aka granny panties. We laughed, she smacked me, I credit card swiped her, she smacked me again and then it was over. Ten minutes later I was patiently waiting for my waffle to prairie dog out of the toaster when I hear the faintest of footsteps. Before I could turn around she had grabbed ahold of not only my gym shorts but my boxers as well. She forcefully tore both to the floor exposing not only my bare ass but my mini Emilio Estevez as well. Laughing ensued and we decided to call a truce. But I couldn't let her have the last say in all of this. So the saga continued all Sunday long. I'll be honest, at around 4 o'clock the whole thing started to get exhausting. I was living in constant fear of having my pants pulled down to my ankles. Eventually it was time for bed. We lost track of who was winning the war and the constant barrage of pants pulling had seemingly stopped. That was until she left her guard down. It was lights out time and instead of getting up to turn the switch off, she decided to kneel on the bed and turn it off with the drawstring. This was it, the pantsing to end all pantsing. As she reached up, I grabbed ahold of her silk nighty and pulled down with a great amount of force. But this time the sound of giggles and laughs were accompanied by a loud ripping noise. No, she didn't fart in my face, I had torn her brand new silk pants at the waste band. Apparently she had tied them rather tight as to avoid getting pantsed again. Not only did I win the war, I Hiroshima'd her ass. We entered into a verbal contract with one another and each rolled onto our own side of the bed.\nTL;DR:"}

We had been like sisters since childhood, went to college together, we were inseparable - it's been so difficult for everyone involved to lose her like this and I'm not sure whether the grief is making what happened harder to accept.\n\nI spent all the time between her death and the funeral (just over 2 weeks) helping to organize everything, informing everyone of her death as well as supporting her family and writing the eulogy. So on the day and even now I was very emotionally drained and at my limits. But I put a lot of effort into the day and I wanted it to be perfect for her as she was perfect herself.\n\nBasically, in our group of friends, there is an on and off couple. They constantly argue and no one really takes them seriously. At the time of the funeral, they were very much off, but were keeping it civil. By the time it got to the wake and they'd had a few drinks, they reconciled, and had sex in the toilets (we rented a venue for it).\n\nWhen all of our friends found out they all thought (and think) that it is hilarious and that it is a great story. I don't really see it that way though... I think it's disrespectful to her and to her family and I don't understand why I'm the only one who thinks this. Am I wrong? I've spoken to other people about it who suggest I'm just being emotional but she means everything to me and I just wanted everyone to respect her memory on the day of her funeral.\nTL;DR:"}

I am awful with girls and I did not make a move for some reason and I regret it to this day, after the movie we just hung out until she had to leave. It felt very awkward the next few weeks. I was so bad with girls I was too scared to go up to her even when we were dating, it was so awful because I knew I was being stupid and I couldn't help it.\n\n Of course she broke up with me, I was hurt but I saw it coming, and after weeks of not talking to each other she finally messages me but it would only be a few messages at a time and she just ignored me. This continued for weeks so I just stopped replying. She then started sending me some pics but I would not send any back. \n\nA few weeks pass and she asks me to hang out, of course I say yes and, we go to a park and just stare at the stars. We held hands, we cuddled and we talked about everything except we never kissed. She then just stops all communication for the next few weeks. I felt broken inside for a very long time. Fast forward to last Saturday night, its been about two years since we've hung out. She asks me to pick her up and we drive around town for two hours just talking, and I absolutely loved it. After dropping her off with a hug I went home and thought about how much I fucked up before. \n\nI think I love this girl but I don't know because i'm just young and stupid.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Relatively mundane question about challenging traffic tickets\nPOST: Hello everyone. First time posting here. \n\nBack story: I am currently twenty years old and have had my license since I was sixteen. I have never been in a collision (with me being responsible or otherwise) and had never been pulled over, arrested, or stopped by an officer in any way until the other night. \n\nSituation: I work at a bar and was leaving work at around 02:15 or so. Initially I was driving on a very well lit road but I got into a darker portion and noticed a car tailgating. Then the blue lights hit and as soon as they turned on, I realized I didn't have my headlights on. I immediately flipped them on and then had a panic attack as I've never been pulled over. So I quickly (within five seconds) pulled over. While pulling over and in my panicked state, I hit the curb. I didn't jump it but definitely gave it a solid love tap. \n\nI immediately rolled down the windows and put my hands on the steering wheel. Officer walked up and I realized that he had probably concluded that I was drunk due to the erratic driving. He asked me questions such as where I was going and where I was coming from etc. I was clearly lucid as I had had nothing to drink or smoke etc. Eventually he took my license and ran it. \n\nI realized that I hadn't turned my lights on (interior) in my panic so I apologized when he returned. I did get a citation for \"lighted headlights/other lights required\" ($119 which strikes me as exorbitant for a first offense). While I do have the ability to pay that, I'd rather not have it on my record if possible. \n\nMy question is what is the likelihood of me going to court and being able to bump this down to a warning. While I'm not thrilled about the prospects of going to court, but if it seems like I have a decent shot, I'd definitely consider. \n\nSecondly, if I did decide to answer the summons, would I have to notify the court of my intent or just show up without having paid the ticket?\nTL;DR:"}

I thought we were in love, but I'm pretty sure the love ended a while ago, though I do know we both still care for each other a lot and enjoy each others company.\n\nAnyway, we want to be friends because we have a lot of mutual friends/hobbies and also we just really enjoy each other as people, despite the fact that we're not meant to be in a romantic relationship (too many fights, clinginess, co-dependency, all that good stuff). \n\nI thought I was doing okay with the friend thing (aside from crying at random points in the day, like at finding one of his socks on my floor), but now I'm not sure if I'm actually okay with being close friends with him or if this is just a cop out so that I don't feel so sad and lonely. Like some of him is better than none right? I don't have to lose all of him right away?\n\nStaying friends with him feels good, talking to him feels good, we just mesh really well as friends without the pressure of a forced relationship. But I really don't want to jeopardize my (or his) healing process. I want to get over him so that I can learn and someday find someone who is a better fit, and I honestly cannot tell if I'm over him, or if my brain is pretending I am just so that I can keep him in my life.\n\nSome additional details:  We've never been really sexually passionate, and recently it's really just seemed like we're in the friendzone, even before the breakup. We were definitely in actual love at some point though (not for a while imo). I don't know if I miss him, or just having a relationship and person to do literally everything with, considering we unhealthily spent every waking minute together. \n\nAny advice for staying friends and/or healing?

Yes, you read the title right, I haven't tipped at a restaurant or similar in about 3 years; and here's why.\n\nSo a bit of background first, I'm 18 and I try my hardest to be polite and courteous to those older than me because that is how I was raised and I do not like being grouped in with the \"snotty teenage\" group. I always have the best intentions (I believe) and care significantly about manners and etiquette. Anyways I digress.\n\nSo today, actually maybe an hour ago, I wanted to make sure that my mobile deposit checks had cashed and wanted to review my bank statement for the month as I had taken my SO out to a (needlessly expensive) dinner. Anyways, as I logged in I was delighted to see the money had in fact transferred and I clicked to see my statement with a big ol' smile.\n\nAfter careful review I stopped smiling.\n\nThe money had indeed gone in, but what I had seen would lead me into a 5 minute investigation to make me realiz I had fucked up for three years. The dinner, for sake of argument, was about $40. I pay with my debit card and always sign at the restaurant and include a nice tip on the receipt to the waiter. However, I did not see the extra $6 I had placed as a tip on the receipt on the statement. So I investigated with a pit in my stomach.\n\nI had scrolled through until my first purchase, and to my unfortunate surprise, realized that despite the fact I had written in a tip on every receipt, it did not actually charge to my card, meaning that it did not actually get put towards the total. For the past three years, I have been writing tips on the receipt without ever actually tipping. \n\nAs a person who always upholds mannerisms, I want to puke. \n\nI have no idea how to tell my SO or my parents or anything, and I'm scared to go back to my frequently visited restaurants and look the waiter/waitress in the face without apologizing endlessly.\n\nSo for those of you who may be in a similar situation, please make sure you check your statements and always carry cash on you.\nTL;DR:"}

Don't know what to do.\nPOST: I have a crush for a one girl from my school. We are both in the highschool right now. We go in the same school for about 4th year, so we kind of know each other, but not so much, we've talked like 2 times. I still remember that i found her really pretty first time i saw her, but it was long ago, we were too young for a realationship back then.\n\nSo yeah, I have a crush on her, but I don't know how to express it to her. I don't see her very often in school, so we can't make almost any eye contact. But I need some kind of reason to go and talk to her, without being creepy or making whole situation awkward. She may know that I kind of like her, because my friend mentioned it to one of her friends long time ago. So yeah, i'm really into her, but i don't know how to approach her. I was thinking about sending some flowers to her, and leaving a kind message and first letter of my name so she could guess it, and then i could finally go and talk to her. But the whole idea seems kind of creepy and weird, at least to some of my friends (I can't imagine what else I could do). ATM I'm trying to catch her gaze and smile to her, show interest, but, as i mentioned, i don't see her very often in school. So yeah, i don't know what to do. I really want to talk to her, but i don't want to look like a creep, or make her feel really awkward. I want to show that I am worthy, so she would agree to go out.\n\nAbout her. I know that she is kind of shy and not so popular. She mostly surrounds herself with a group or pair of friends. I've heard that she has rejected a lot of guys, and didn't have any realationships for a quite a long time (perhaps a year). One friend told me that she is bitchy towards guys.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 1st on my XC team and I was really hoping to be the first student to win in a while. My main competitor was a 42-year-old who we'll call Steve. Now, Steve was ahead for most of the race, but I stayed connected to him. Then in the last miles, I surged ahead and took first place. I was in first going about 20 meters from the finish and Steve was about 10 meters behind me. We were both in our closing sprints and it was clear that I had beaten him. Now the finish line was on the right side of a fence, but one could also run on the left side, around the fence, then to the finish, which is what happened in the fun run that was earlier that day. Going to the fence I was unsure of which side to go, but I was pretty sure I should go left. But then I see a guy in the crowd motioning to go right, so that's what I do. Suddenly I hear my coach yell \"I_love_gummy_bears, what are you doing!?\" So I quickly turn around to go to the other side of the fence. However, that area was muddy and I was wearing flats, not spikes. So I slipped and fell in the mud. I got up and sprinted to the finish, but by this time Steve had gotten ahead of me. Steve only got me by about 0.4 seconds, but I still got second place. But I PRed with 17:36, which was nice. The second place trophy is still in my room, but I can hardly look at it without being annoyed.\nTL;DR:"}

After having secured most of the details he asked me to check the weather. I said I would do so and told him to call back in 5 minutes once I'd checked online. He agreed and signed off the call with an extremely long burp (which I barely registered having grown immune to our mutual deficiency in basic manners whilst together). \n\nI open up a weather forecast and approximately 3 minutes later the phone wrings. I throw aside my laptop and rush to the phone and, hoping to assert my dominance over his impressive belch, place the receiver firmly between my buttocks and exonerate my bowls with a earth shattering discharge of flatulence. After issuing my tour de force I move the phone back up to my mouth and to further salt the wound I cry \"I hope you liked that you slut.\" Proud of my spontaneous outburst I listen tentatively for the response. \n  \nAfter an almost uncomfortable silence the voice of an elderly frail woman crackled through the receiver and, though not foreign to me, was wholly unexpected.

The class starts at 1:30 PM and I usually leave around 1:15 because it is only a 5-10 minute drive, depending on the high school traffic which is nearby. I was listening to music on my bed waiting for the time to leave and I put on a Pandora station started by Weezer. Apparently there is a song titled \"12:51\" by the Strokes, but I did not know this until recently. I check my phone for the time, and the first thing I see is the song title \"12:51\". I assume that is the time and go back to zoning out. However the time was probably more like 1:10-1:12 PM, as I checked it (what I assume) 10 minutes later and I noticed that the time was 1:22. So I hurry to my car and drive to class, but I am still five minutes late. And unfortunately this professor is really strict on tardies and locks the door.

While me and my boyfriend of course don't always see eye to eye, we generally have a relationship full of love and respect. There's no puppy love left after all this time, but I'd definitely say I still love the guy and know he feels the same.\n\nWe're both working and there's a two hour drive in between us, with both of us living pretty close to our respective workplaces. This leads to us not meeting often during the weekdays (although it does happen a few times a month), instead spending most entire weekends together.\n\nIn turn, I spend more time in the weekdays with one of my friends from work. Not every evening of course, but we go to each other's flats often enough to hang out. This has never been an issue. My boyfriend isn't the jealous type, what's more my friend is gay. We may have grown incredibly close, but things are off limits by nature and this has never been a problem to me.\n\nThese past few weeks, my friend has started dating this guy he met on the internet. I was very happy to hear this, cause he's had a lot of problems finding somebody who seemed his type, but now things were turning out very well for him.\n\nBut while I am happy for him still, I can't help but feel jealous somehow. It feels weird that somebody will get to nab him. Somebody not me? A few days ago when he was showing me his and his date's text correspondence like he's done so many times before, I found myself being overly judging and critical of everything his date put. What's more, at one point I started getting some idea in my head to just grab his head and kiss his thoughts away. *\"You're not leaving me\"* I thought.\n\nLeaving? He's not even mine. I'm with my boyfriend, and I feel happy with him. I have no idea what my head is doing at the moment and it's really annoying. Feels like some kind of high school drama I should have had many years ago. Is this what emotional infidelity is like? Am I cheating on my boyfriend?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25M] with my girlfriend [23F] for one year, I love her but I am having serious doubts and not sure what to do.\nPOST: I love my girlfriend. She loves me. We care about each other immensely. We have a good sex life. We trust each other. I can't imagine being with anyone else. \n\nAnd yet, I have serious recurring doubts about the longevity of our relationship.\n\nOur relationship has always felt a bit doomed from the start. I live in a developing country. She is from here. I had always planned on only being here temporarily but we met and we fell in love and we gave it a shot. Six months ago I had decided to go traveling for a bit with the intention to go home but shortly after I left I realized how much she means to me and decided to come back. Note: we had already broken up once before this.\n\nRecently, we looked into the immigration process and it would take approximately 2 years from the time of application to take her to my home country. We're both relatively young and probably 2 years away from marriage. That would mean 4 more years of living here... which scares the shit out of me. I seriously don't think I can do it. I feel trapped and unfulfilled here.\n\nOur relationship isn't perfect - we fight a lot, there's a communication barrier at times, sometimes I feel emotionally manipulated and under-appreciated - but we truly love each other and we usually do our best to work through our problems. Lately she's been stressed from work and it's made things worse. She's a very private person and I feel like the relationship has made me more private as well (which I don't like). She can be a bit controlling and I feel like I am starting to lose my 'me' time. Part of these are cultural differences and differences in expectations.\n\nI expressed my doubt to her. She told me that she loves me more than she loves herself and wants me to be happy. If that means leaving then she understands. \n\nI've been going in circles the last few days. Part of me thinks that just because we love each other it doesn't mean that we are right for each other. And at the same time, I can't imagine being with someone else. I am not sure what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by playing the pass out game\nPOST: This was back in 8th grade, in wood shop class. My friend, (let's call him Kyle) taught my other friend, ( let's call him Mike) and I, how to make ourselves black out. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. A simple process of kneeling down, hyperventilating, then standing up after about 30 seconds and putting your thumb in your mouth and blowing (like blowing air into a balloon) then you gain consciousness a few moments later. Me being my curious and stupid self, it sounded fun at the time, so of course I tried it in the middle of the class period. So I do everything Kyle told me to do, and just like he said, I woke up from consciousness with my head down on the table. We were all laughing and entertained by this stupid thing to do. So Mike told me to do it again, so I thought okay no big deal, this is kind of fun. So I go through the steps again, and this is where the major fuck up happens. I wake up laying flat on my face, slowly regaining my vision and hearing. I look up from the concrete floor to see the entire class and the teacher circled around me. At this point I was thinking \"Oh shit this is not good\". My teacher grabs me by the arms and pulls me up and walks me to the bathroom to wash my face off. I didn't know why I needed to do that until I saw my face when I looked in the mirror. My mouth and nose were covered in blood, and my tongue kept poking something sharp. I open my mouth to see two of my teeth chipped completely in half. Fast forward about 45 minutes, and my mom shows up, and she is *livid*. She takes me to the dentist to see what they can do, and I get an appointment to get my teeth fixed two weeks later. Needless to say the bill wasn't cheap. And that's my story of making myself pass out in wood shop and costing my mom a lot of money to fix my teeth.\nTL;DR:"}

During this time, because we ended up opening up to each other about all sorts of things, one of those things from her side was the relationship with her (now) ex-boyfriend. Basically, I was there the whole time she talked about the problems they had, contemplated a break-up, then finally carried out the break-up and went through the stages of post-break-up stress and guilt (they had been together for 4 years, but also in \"long-distance\" for the most part).\n\nWhile for me the fact that she had a boyfriend was obviously a barrier of sorts previously, her now official separation with him has not affected our own relationship *that* much: in the sense that it doesn't necessarily bring *me* closer to her instead. There are reasons for that (one of the key ones is geographical separation between us, and also a completely different nature of the relationship this is), but, like I said, we are both aware of each other's feelings and are fumbling for ways to see what can work between us.\n\nNow, in the meantime, hypothetical thoughts of being *actually* together with her have obviously been on my mind a lot, and one of those that stand out is the title.

So, previously it never bothered me. With this girl: it somewhat does. Basically, every time we however briefly talk about any sex related subjects, I can't help but picture her doing that with her ex-boyfriend (who I, unfortunately, know way too much about, although only through her) and that makes me sad and uncomfortable.\nTL;DR:"}

I currently have summer job working in a local amusement park in a small town within Northern Ireland. One of the requirements for this job is to operate the ghost train carts as they go in one door and come out the other, while allowing customers on. Using a operating desk, with three buttons on it, i am able to control when cars go in, when the ones in the middle can be moved up and when the ones that have just come out the bottom (with people in them) can be moved up once the customer has left the cart. So...When the customer comes out the bottom door of the ghost train, they are about a 20ft gap away from due to the space for the other carts to take up. Because of this I try to make them leave their cart asap to prevent another coming out and  crashing into them, and some times i'll press the button to control that cart just a tad to move it so they get the idea to move out quickly. One day a woman comes out the bottom of the ghost train....and just sits there. It's a busy day, im trying to deal with a lot of customers, and I have 6 other people breathing down my neck trying to get on.  I tell them I need to get this woman off before they can go on. So, i hit the bottom and shunt her car while she's only starting to try and sit up, she looks shocked at me. I do it again, she looks even more shocked. I start staring at her, implying \"please hurry up. you're taking your time\" and she slowly moves her way out of the car, grabbing the bars around her and slowly pulling herself out. The I notice something odd, a man starts hugging her as she exits the cart, as if she can't stand...and then I remember. I look behind me, and there lies the wheelchair she asked me to look after while she got on the ride. She said her husband would collect it after the ride was done... and in my rush I had forgotten who she was and that she had cerebral palsy. I felt disgusting.\nTL;DR:"}

We had a great time, bar hopping and had great conversations...Then we went back to his place to have sex. I insisted him to use a condom and we even got dressed to go and buy some but in the heat of the moment he didn't use one. I was angry and yelled at him. He apologized but I left even though he asked me to stay the night. \n\nThen this last weekend we went out drinking again, and again we had an excellent time talking and I feel like we do have some kind of a connection. Again we went back to his place to fuck. This time he did have condoms and used them without me asking so that was cool. However, he did some things that were very porn-ish without first asking me and I don't even know if I should feel offended. First off he shoved his cock into my throat without asking, I've never had that happen before and tears were coming out of my eyes. Also he came on my face. Three times, without asking me. I didn't say anything to him about these so perhaps he thinks it's OK? I didn't think much about it at the time because the sex was really hot and I enjoyed the dominant aspects of it. The sex is actually really good and he does pay a lot of attention to my feelings and we did cuddle and pillow talked and all that afterwards so it's not like he's 'using' me for sex.\n\nBut after talking to some friends I started to feel kind of weird, like these are very porn-like things and I feel like he's using me to fulfill his fetishes, is there a fetish to treat a woman like a porn actress in real life? Is it a thing he has with Asian women? Should I talk to him about this, even though I didn't say anything at the time? I really like this guy, though perhaps nothing more than weekend benders/fuck-buddies at least for the time being.\nTL;DR:"}

I take the IB which is difficult and it's time consuming and I have insomnia, so I'm not always easy to be around. \n\nHe dropped out of Uni and worked as a waiter for a year, but he's quit that and so now he has all this free time that I don't have. I don't want to be in a relationship any more, I don't have the time.\n\nHe's great. We like all the same things, we get along well, he's understanding and he loves me. We settled into the relationship really fast and all is good, except that he smokes an obscene amount of cigarettes and weed and he occasionally takes ecstasy. \n\nI really dislike this, but I care for him.\n\n*Anyway*, so I've decided that I want to end things because I don't have the time to properly make him happy whilst maintaining my happiness and my grades. On top of this, not only am I going off to Uni next year, but I'm also moving to Rome (we currently reside in Istanbul, *british expat wassup*). He's never left Turkey and I honestly see no future and I don't want to keep on wasting his time.\n\nI need advice on how to break up with him. \n\nDo we meet in a public place, sit him down and do it and then we go our separate ways... or do I call him to save him the embarrassment (he deserves better)?

Many Facebook messages followed with how he wants to help me, how he wants to be with me, that he is perfect for me, why did I do this to him, etc... I mostly ignored these messages until a recent one when he said he will make sure all my friends will leave me and he will be the only person who will want to help me.

How wrong was I...\n\nI found out he recently spoke to quite a few of my friends (one of them is a mutual friend I guess, they became quite good friends when we started dating). And he somehow made them avoid me and one of them even decidet to move out (we were supposed to share my apartment during the school year). He is sharing lies about what I said about them (really mean things I wouldn't say), that I am an evil person and shit like that. Usually I wouldn't mind.

In addition, when she came over at 8am, she left herself in as he was taking a showering at the time and just happened to come back topless when he knew she was in there.  They proceeded to take pictures in where she used these pictures to show to her friends about how handsome he is, while blocking these pictures from me and never ever even mentioning this.

We built it later that night complete with the push button sparker, which I was very proud of having installed.  Naturally after it was done and the PVC was drying I was telling my mom about it and how great it was.  Here's where the FU starts:  I really wanted to show her gun and how the sparker worked, so I say: \"hey why don't you look down the barrel, and I'll spark it!\"  so she can see the spark in all of it's glory.  Unfortunately neither of us were considering the fact that the volatile PVC cleaner/glue fumes had built up in the chamber of the gun. \n\nWhen I sparked it, there was a satisfying *whump* and cone of fire shot out of the barrel directly into her eye.

He's so distant and private- it's always me telling him I love him, and it's safe to say I put in 95% of the romantic aspect of our relationship. In short, he makes me feel unloved and unappreciated- we never go out together or do anything at all, and he's shy to the point of it being ridiculous. I can understand preliminary shyness, but whenever I kiss or hug him in public (which I'm only allowed to do when no one is around) and someone walks in/past, he physically pushes me away, and it stings. He's painfully embarrassed about buying condoms, and goes to great lengths to conceal them- it takes him ages to even pick them up, because he won't go down the store aisle until it's empty. I'm completely unsatisfied with our sex life (I have difficulty orgasming) so I only have sex because I know he wants it- nothing else. This is frustrating, because he is a pretty selfish person in bed, and there's only so much I can give.\n\nWe don't really talk anymore. The majority of the time, it feels like I'm really fighting to hold a conversation with him. I'm sick of always giving out affection and going far out of my way to make him feel loved and appreciated, but he never reciprocates this, and I feel like he doesn't care.\n\nI'm tired of feeling like I don't matter. I've been there for him every single time he's needed me, but whenever I mention that I'm not feeling great (I struggle with depression and anxiety) he either changes the topic entirely or gives a generic 'it will be fine' and moves on.\n\nI love him, I really do, but this relationship is completely one sided and I don't know what to do. He tells me he loves me (rarely), but I catch myself thinking 'do you?' Am I in the wrong here? What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

About a year ago we started hanging out more often then usual, it used to be anywhere from seeing or talking to each other once a month, if that.  But in the past year its been about once a week or more, and being around her so much more, has made me realize that i really like this girl and would like to pursue a relationship with her.\n\nBut im afraid she doesn't feel the same way because of how long we have know each other and it might be weird to try and date me since we have been friends for years, i mean we were never really in the same crowds in high school or hung out that much, we have just been friends for a long time, but not to close of friends.  Its hard to explain but i hope you get what i mean. But my problem is about her break up. Im not sure how long i should wait to tell her how i feel, because i dont want to just be the rebound guy, and later on she realizes that she only started dating me because of her being in a vulnerable spot.\n\nI also don't want to tell her to early because it wouldn't be fair to put that on her, while dealing with the break up. But we are going hiking on Wednesday and i know this will be bugging me the whole time. How long should i wait to tell her i like her? i just don't want to fuck it up, and maybe im over thinking this whole thing. But i really do like her\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you reddit\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I ended up eating all of it, so I bought a replacement. No big deal right? Wrong. This was the start of an escalating problem that's turned into a kind of silly but SUPER FRUSTRATING fight.\n\nSo my boyfriend pretty much at all of the 2nd pint of ice cream, despite my getting annoyed at him when I saw him digging through it (he picks out all the good parts too, which annoys me on it's own). He acts like he's being cute. So I was like, whatever, fine, these ice creams are gone, but we still technically owe our friend for the original ice cream, plus we are out, so I bought a larger size of a cheaper ice cream in the same flavor. So, at this point, my boyfriend promptly ate most of this one too.\n\nAt this point I confronted him and was like, dude, you owe me a pint of the nice version of the ice cream. So he was like cool, don't worry, I'll get you one, and he did. Problem is, he has ALREADY eaten most of that one including most of the good parts!! I am so mad!!\n\nI'm not sure what to do and I seriously feel really annoyed by this. I want to buy another just for myself but I know he will just eat that one too; he acts like I'm being crazy when I don't share. And maybe I am, because it is just ice cream. That's where I guess I need advice. I am pretty psycho about watching what I eat, but with something like ice cream I SLOWLY portion it out and think about it for ages like almost to an insane degree. So I don't like having to feel paranoid about my share. But maybe that is kind of crazy.\n\nSo, am I overreacting? Should I pursue this \"issue\" haha?

All seemed well and I fell asleep pretty quickly.\n\nFour hours later, I'm shocked awake by an overpowering burning sensation in my throat and a taste which I recognize as stomach acid. However, I immediately realize that I can't breathe. I immediately sit up and desperately try to swallow so I can clear my throat, yet swallowing is extremely difficult. Worse still, once I do clear the acid out of my throat I realize that my throat is completely closed up. Only through great effort do I manage to pull in a small breath, then another, then another, until finally my throat opens up and I start hacking and wheezing to catch my breath. The whole thing was over in like 15 seconds but it felt like forever.\n\nOnce I catch my breath, I become aware of a lot of pressure in my stomach. I then release a *huge* amount of gas from my stomach, at least three really big belches worth, and realize that the gas must've forced acid up into my throat and closed off my larynx. I'd heard of larynx spasms before and how they can temporarily make breathing nearly impossible.\n\nSo now that I'm wide awake, I do a little online research before risking going back to bed. I find out that this is apparently a somewhat common occurrence for people with acid reflux that eat just before bed, and I guess I'm just lucky and haven't had it happen until now.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen. Has anyone on Reddit ever had this rude awakening? If so, how often can I expect it to happen, and what did you do that really worked to control it?\nTL;DR:"}

I was not super close with her aunt, but I was pretty close with her grandparents (the aunt's parents). I have had on and off contact with my ex since she broke up with me last January, and she has kept me up to date on her aunt's health. \n\nAnyway, last week she told me the news when it happened, and then a day or two ago, she informed me her grandmother told her to ask me to come to both mass and the reception for the funeral. I was hesitant to agree go, because I didn't want to be a distraction (this would be the first time I would see her family since she left me). I voiced these concerns, but my ex said that it would help her grandparents if I was there, and her whole family wanted me to be there because 'they love me' and still want her to be with me and still think she is going to marry me one day. \n\nThe whole situation makes me uncomfortable, but I would to help if I can - but am worried that my being there might bring about some unneeded drama. I am not concerned with behaving inappropriately myself, but I'm concerned that her family might end up asking me questions which I will not be prepared or comfortable with answering, based on my ex's comments on how they feel about me and still want her to be with me.\n\nDoes anyone have some advice for how to handle the situation?\nTL;DR:"}

She will make out with someone that she knows somewhat well, but it can't be anywhere that someone could possibly have a chance of seeing her. We talk a lot about sexual things but she is very reluctant to talk on the topic when it turns towards her and her experiences. She has told me that she wishes she wasn't shy and in her words \"prudish\".\n  \nI do like her as more than a friend and she is very well aware of this. I really do want to help her but i'm worried if I just try to \"help\" her on my own it would be from the part that wants to be more than friends, and not from the part that is essentially her best and one of her few friends.\n  \nShe has never had a boyfriend and doesn't understand the process someone goes through to get one and where to go from there. I had told her that the first step to be less shy was to try to be a little more open when talking about herself. After 20 minutes or so she was being more open with herself than I thought she would be and that kind of told me that she was serious about wanting to change.\n  \nI'm wondering if there is anything that I can do to help her or if there are things we can do or talk about that can get her to be open with herself both physically and emotionally but not something that can hurt the friendship.\n  \nPlease be honest with how you feel about this or if you personally think im crossing a line.\nTL;DR:"}

Career wise, it would be a smart move for me to go somewhere that's more of a technology center, like the SF bay area (which is far away). If not, I now have enough saved up for a down payment on a house in my preferred neighborhood in this city, and that would be a financially smart decision right now.\n\nOn the other hand, she's just graduating now, and is going to take a year off to try to get into a grad school for her desired career. She hasn't yet decided if she'll live in my city (where 3/4 of the relavent schools in our state are), or if she'll live at home with her parents to save a little money, and spend time with friends from high school.\n\nA month or so ago, she asked if we should be dating, but I told her we'd talk about it once she graduated, since we were both happy at the time. That's coming up in the next week, andI don't know if we could make it through me moving most of the way across the country, her living at home with high school friends, or me turning into a real, home owning adult before she even starts grad school.

I know shes not going to run back to her ex and shes not looking for guys at the moment. She really just wants to be single and have fun with family, friends and learn to be happy while single.\n\nI will certainly give her space and if something comes along I will follow it. I am not waiting for her but is it possible to remain in touch? We knew each other for a whole school year, were in 3 classes together over that year. I know I don't mean as much as her ex but we still saw each other regularly for a year. She must have had some feelings for me. I don't plan on contacting her soon.

Secondly, I feel as if sexually we aren't on the same page. We've talked about sex many times before (what we might like, willing to try, everything) but initiation of anything vaguely sexual leads to me being shut down. When I asked if he wanted to have sex (in general anything sexual) he gave me some excuse about needing to do some man prep work.

I do not feel the same way as I did with my first girlfriend. My ex and I dated for a few years, and it was a very positive experience. With my current girlfriend, I do not have the same electric feeling. Maybe it's because with my first girlfriend, everything was for the first time. I don't mean I do not care for my current girlfriend. I certainly do. I am very happy spending time with her and I miss her when I am not with her. It's just that I am not sure if the lack of ecstasy this early in our relationship that makes you tremble and smile from ear to ear is a bad sign for the future. Or, maybe I have just grown up just a little. \n\nSecond, we have not had sex yet. Therefore, I am unsure about our sexual compatibility. I am physically attracted to her, and she is to me as well. Is the only way to find out our compatibility through the actual act itself?\n\nLastly, to the older/more experience Redditors, did you know early on if you and your SO were meant to last?

IMO, it was one of the best endings I've ever read.  I didn't like *everything* about it.  For instance, the Crimson King was so anti-climactic.  But I understand what SK was going for.  The King was mad, absolutely insane in his solitude.  All his power lied in influencing weaker beings, he had no true power by the time Roland got to him.  I wasn't a fan of how the ka-tet was killed off, either, but I feel it was inevitable.  Mostly, I didn't like seeing these characters I'd come to love over the past 10 years or so killed off.  But they had to die, that was the story.  It was their destiny.  \nBut the actual ending, the part after King warns you to stop reading, was brilliant.  It fits perfectly with the final verse of the poem The Dark tower was based on, [Child Roland to the Dark Tower Came.] (What a great poem, and I don't even like poetry especially!)  \nThe idea that Ka was a wheel, that \"everything has happened before and it will happen again\" hit me like a bag of bricks.  \nNow, while I read more than anyone I know here in the trailer park, I have no doubt that most of you all are much more well read than I.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: I'm tired of being let down by not getting texted back, but she is way to similar to ignore. What do I do? (22M)\nPOST: What's up ladies and gents.  I have a bit of a dilemna regarding a certain lady I tried to court.  But first: a backstory.\n\nI met this lovely lady at a party.  I liked her right from the bat.  It is uncanny how similar our individual pasts are; we grew up near each other, went hundreds of miles away to the same university and she has taken over projects I started when I was a freshman.  We are also of the same religious views (religious diversity isn't exactly huge where I currently live, and I am certainly an outlier).  We fooled around a little the night of the party and went on one date a week and a half ago.  \n\nSince day one she has been pretty bad at texting back.  Sometimes it will be hours before I hear back, other times it will be days.  Personally, I don't have the patience to deal with \"texting rules\" like what it means if you text too much or not enough, but I know other people are catty enough that it makes a difference.  That is to say, I have no idea if she intentionally isn't texting back or is genuinely bad at texting, nor do I really care.  The one trend I have noticed is there seems to be a particularly long delay when I ask to hang out.  But, again, I don't know or care enough to read too much into it.  \n \nNow to my question: I got a reply today from asking her what she was doing over the weekend (from Friday).  5 days difference.  I'm at the point now where, every time I don't hear back from her, it's just a let down.  I don't want to text her back because I know it could be days before I hear from her, and I don't want to get disappointed again.  Ordinarily it would be no-brainer to just stop texting back, but my mind-hole is still blown at how similar our stories are.  I know that someone like this doesn't just walk into your life very often, and I should take advantage of it.\nTL;DR:"}

Midway through our time together, she was applying for a more permanent job, so she sought and was prescribed some psychiatric medication to treat social anxiety and some other emotional / behavioural issues (which I hadn't observed personally). The problem was that she took them on and off, so she seemed to have frequent withdrawals. They came with quick anger, irritability, and a general outlook that people were trying to antagonise her no matter what they did or said. (There's an example in the previous post.) I was a target of this behaviour several times a month.\n\n**Resolution**: I've been thinking about the situation a lot for the past few days (especially in light of another recent blow-up), and I considered the comments from the previous post. Yesterday, I sent her an email telling her that I couldn't take her abuse anymore and that we were finished, both as romantic interests and as friends. I thanked her for all of the good times we had and asked her to take good care of herself.\n\nI got an email back talking about how no one can actually ever understand her. She claimed that she was having doubts about our relationship and wanted to tell me to break it off (despite the fact that she always called me every night, and at times was flirtatious); she mentioned repeatedly how immature, judgmental, and insecure I've become, and that I needed to just \"be myself\". She finally said that I needed to find myself and fix my problems.\n\nI guess that the letter is ironic, because I don't think that I've been the one going through frequent and drastic changes. But that's okay - I'm going to stick to my email and cut contact with her. I really do wish her the best.\n\nI just want to thank everyone who commented in the previous post (and the community in general). Your help and insight has been tremendously valuable.\nTL;DR:"}

But my uncle Alex stayed around and helped my mom out, and he remained in my life and we're really close.  She's always loved him for staying with her after Dad's death and being a part of our lives.  Graduations, birthday parties, even a field trip or two...Alex was there.\n\nLately I've quit calling him uncle, because I don't think of him that way.  He's handsome and giving and really everything you'd want in a man.  He's got his life in order and he's thoughtful and funny. I think I fell for him a long time ago and it's just been eating at me.\n\nWe've gone out a lot just the two of us, not always at my request.  He'll always pay and open doors for me.  He says I'm gorgeous and one time admitted I'm sexy.  He hasn't ever made any move toward me, however.  I've started thinking of him romantically, but feel like he may never reciprocate or act on it.  Mostly because my mother would kill him, even though she herself always thought he was a catch.  She'd think it's a Woody Allen/adopted daughter type thing, but I've moved out and she's not involved with my love life anymore.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what I'd have to do to pursue a relationship with Alex, and I truly believe my father would have been supportive.  He really loved Alex from what I've heard.  I'm scared that he either will not pursue it because of age difference or because of what my mother would think. Or maybe he'd feel like it was morally wrong?  I do believe he's attracted to me.  And of course, there's the risk that it won't work out at all, and I can't stand losing him.\nTL;DR:"}

I caught him sharing a picture of a girl to his buddies and leering over her figure (not just a random girl, he knows her from their family vacation spot). Due to already feeling a little insecure post-pregnancy, this actually cut me really deeply despite his insistence that it was harmless and he never meant to hurt me. When I explained that it affected my self esteem he rolled his eyes and accused me of being dramatic. \n\nNow, even though it's been a few weeks since then, it still hurts when I remember it and I still feel incredibly disrespected.

It has to be, essentially, asked for several hours in advance.\n\nThe masturbation thing? My wife doesn't masturbate. She's said that she hasn't even tried. My logic, and forgive me if it's horrifically flawed, is that sex simply isn't a part of my wife's regular health. She veers away from playing with herself and, therefore, never gets up the gumption to be independently sexual. The private pleasure of sex is basically foreign to her.\nTL;DR:"}

So this morning I woke up late and was running a little late for work, the usual. My 2 cats wake follow me around every morning until I've finally put breakfast in their bowls and I leave for work. I realize that after I put food in their two bowls I would be completely out of cat food. I made a mental note to grab some on the way home from work. As a side note, I live with my parents, who like to let the cats outside when I'm not home. I arrived home from work, huge bag of cat food in hand, and my cats ran by me as I came down the walkway. I got to the outside door that leads to my room, swung it open, and the cats ran in as I finally put the bag down. I look over at my cats, and apparently they couldn't wait for me to come home to eat, because one of them dropped a mouse in the center of my room, still alive. The cats are now completely enamored with the food bag because now they know it's time to eat. The mouse, not being an idiot, takes off running. So now my cats are eating, and I'm checking every corner and crevice of my room looking for a mouse with no luck whatsoever.\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend warned me her ex would be there, and that he's \"crazy\". I met him and he was actually pretty cool. She didn't tell him we're dating, because they're still friends and she wanted to \"avoid drama\".\n\nWe all head out to a bar, and as I'm buying a drink, I turn around to see his hand around her waist. At first I just sat back and watched. What I took away was that she was doing nothing to stop his advances (though, from what I saw, they never went further than his hand on her waist). When she saw me looking, she left his side and went to talk to some of her other friends.\n\nI didn't talk to her about it until the morning after, while we were still in bed.

Climbing apparently is one of those sports that breaks you down to build you back up again, and seeing that I had not been in a year, I instantly began accumulating scrapes and calluses, and I pulled ham string to make it even more clear how out of shape I am (only 2 climbs in). Don't get me wrong, I had a great time, and I think rock climbing is a form of fitness that is 100 times more enjoyable than working out, but it freaking tears you apart. So after a bit of painful success climbing some somewhat difficult walls, I took the advise of my friends to try out this harder course. Feeling skillful, I confidently began scaling its horizontal path with s series of foot holds 1ft off the ground leading to a vertical portion. I only lasted one minute before my hand slipped off of the ridiculously awkward hand hold knob thing, only to transfer all my weight into another knob that happened to intersect with my elbow as I fell 1 ft to the floor. I suddenly felt lava engulf my fore-arm as the knob slammed into my funny bone hard enough to make a loud BAM. I just laid there regretting my life decisions as fire and a tingly numbing sensations spread throughout my arm. After a good minute of repressing tears, I managed to pick myself back up and the burning sensation subsided after a while, but not the tingly numb part... So about 12 hours later, my arm is still feeling the funny, and I am afraid I may be perpetually in funny bone sensation.\nTL;DR:"}

I felt sad and just started messaging a random girl on snapchat that I never even talked to before. We talked about our days and that's it, I left. The next day my girlfriend called crying that she wants to be with me. We both apologized and were back together, and that girl that I talked to messaged me again and said \"Lmao you two are back together\" so I said \"I had no one else to date, I liked you a lot but your too far away\" and I feel like complete shit for saying it because it's totally not true. I love my girlfriend very much and I've never connected with anyone as much as with her, shes my best friend and I was her best friend. I am still in highschool and I am working two weeks in a row for 7 hours every day after 8 hours of school sanding paint off decks and doing yard work so I could afford buying her a firework show for our 6 months and have other money to spend on her to make her happy.. yesterday I got a splinter in my eye from sanding.. I really do love her and I stopped talking to the other girl the day that we got back together, other then when she replied \"lmao your back together\". My girlfriend figured out my password and sneaked on my phone while I was at the bathroom and read over the messages. I know what I said was wrong the minute I said it and I didn't talk to that other girl after I said that; I didn't want to feel desperate for my girlfriend after we broke up and I felt like that other girl liked me and I didn't want to hurt her by saying that I didn't like her... I wouldn't trade my girlfriend for anything and I would do anything to take it back, but now she asked for a week of space and told me not to talk to her while she thinks about it. Will she most likely break up with me? What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Unsure if the (27 M) guy I was dating sexually assaulted me (26 F).\nPOST: So I dated this guy for about three weeks, then he asked me to come along on a trip to California with him. Up until this trip, we'd gotten along great, and he seemed like a sweet, genuine guy (my friends now claim they thought he felt \"fake\", but didn't tell me that at the time). \n\nThe only little blip in this three week period was that when we were hooking up one time (I was giving him a blow job), he shoved my head down and held it there while he came, which made me choke and freak out. I told him never to do that again, that it freaked me out, I hated it, etc etc. and he said he would never do it again. \n\nSo fast forward about a week, and I go on this trip with him. The first day we're in Cali, we start hooking up. He ends up doing the exact same thing to me again (forcefully holding my head down and coming, making me choke). Once again, I freaked out, was practically crying, said what he'd done was rape-y, was just super angry. \n\nWe had a pretty awful trip after that (including the time he got mad at me and on top of other things, made me apologize for calling what he'd done \"rape-y\"), and on the plane ride home I told him I didn't want to see him again.\n\nMy question is, would you consider what he did sexual assault? I have absolutely zero intentions of trying to press charges or anything, I'm just curious what other people think. This happened almost two weeks ago and it hasn't left my mind.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [21/m] and I think the girl I'm seeing [18/f] wants me to consider an open relationship\nPOST: Hey all,\n\nSo I've been seeing this girl for almost two months now, and things have been going very well. Physically and emotionally I'm connecting and I really enjoy her company. Things have been moving in a more serious direction as of late, with me wanting to be in a committed relationship. When I've brought the subject up previously she's just kind of brushed it off and said she doesn't know me quite well enough yet, but we talked again last night and she told me that she was concerned that while she was attracted to me in the same way, she has a tendency to want to fuck a lot of people.\n\nThe way she explained it was that she's very much physically attracted to me and emotionally as well, but in past relationships she's had with guys, she'll find someone who she wants to have sex with and do so, then go back to being with her significant other. Not in an intimate way with the other guy, mind you, more of a once-and-done thing. It also isn't that her significant other isn't able to please her; it's that she likes experiencing sex with different partners.\n\nI've never really been in a relationship where my partner and I weren't exclusively committed to each other. I think ideally that is what I want to have, but I'm not sure that that's just me regurgitating what is socially accepted, because the more I think about it, the more I realize I'd be okay with her sleeping with someone else, as long as it wasn't an intimate thing for her. I don't really have the desire to be with anyone else when I'm attracted to someone, but I think I could respect someone who feels differently and still maintain a relationship with them, as long as we had some pretty clear boundaries. I definitely trust this girl; she has absolutely no need to tell me all this stuff. I mean, she could just go sleep with someone now and not tell me, but as far as I'm aware (and as far as she's told me), she hasn't, so it sounds like she's just kind of warning me ahead of time that this may be a possibility if I continue to develop things with her.\nTL;DR:"}

Over the relationship I've been through different mental stages and lost myself inside that whirlwind of emotions and things and the last months of our relationship were pretty bad.

There is some kind of contact, that I believe with the right communication can turn into a relationship once again. The thing is that I need to get better at this. After I've lost all my confidence with this girl a few months ago, our communication sucks. It mostly consists of me asking questions about her and she done there and how she's been, more and more questions. I don't know what to talk about anymore. I also have the problem of getting too uptight when she's talking to me, I start thinking and overthinking every word I say. We can only talk about our issues and things that are deep between us. How can I start talking with her about ordinary things, without only asking questions all the time? I'm afraid that there won't be anything to talk about if I stop asking questions.

We're usually long distance during the school year then in our hometown on breaks. \n\nSo the problem I'm having is that he won't skype me. Like at all. After one break I brought up how once I go back to school, I'd like to skype just once a week for 15 minutes. I thought that was very reasonable since we were both on school (his is online) and we both have part time jobs. \n\nAfter a few failed attempts of making time to skype through my first week back I reiterated that it was important to me that we are able to see each other and talk and not just text. Well he got really upset saying that he is extremely busy and he doesn't have 15 minutes to just put aside to Skype and I need to stop bringing it up and making it such a big deal. \n\nWe skyped once last month and other than that I can't think of other times we have recently or for the month or two before that. We see each other every other week for a day or full weekend if we both get off work. I just thought it would be nice if we could talk and see each other once a week and didn't think I was asking too much. We used to skype when he was first pursuing me and it would be for 3-5 hours on average. \n\nI just want to know if I'm asking too much or if this is reasonable? Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

He has served his two year state sentence, but in lieu of probation he is serving a 6 month county sentence. \n\nEver since he was transferred to county he's been having trouble eating due to the quality of the food. He says that it's unrecognizable. Now, my stepdad isn't a picky guy. I've never known him to turn anything resembling food away.

He is a very good looking guy so it doesn't surprise me that he gets asked out by other women. That doesn't mean I want to hear about it... I'm more concerned about why he feels the need to tell me these stories.  \nYesterday he told me that an old friend asked him out and how he was \"such a gentleman\" by telling her that he would have accepted the offer had he not already been in a relationship. He must have seen the look on my face because he sort of faltered as he was ending the story and corrected his statement by saying \"maybe\" he would have accepted the offer... I was obviously hurt and he then went about reassuring me that she is not a threat. Why even tell me this story in the first place? I also noticed that he has added his ex from 3 years ago when she recently \"liked\" a photo of the two of us. Why would he just decide to add her now, after so long?   \nHe didn't say stuff like this to me in the start, but it is something that is occurring with increasing frequency. At first when he mentioned random girls flirting with him I wasn't particularly bothered. But yesterday's comments have stuck with me.  \nShould I be seriously considering breaking up with him?

I've met a couple of guys since the break up that I was attracted to but couldn't see it going anywhere so I let it fizzle out. A few weeks ago however I met a guy through some mutual friends that I really get along with and conversation and laughs just come easy to us. On our 1st date we went on a 3 hour walk and conversation never went dull. There was no kiss at the end of the 1st or 2nd date and we're both busy with work and school so we didn't see each other for a couple weeks but talked the whole time. Yesterday we got together to watch a movie and ended up making out. I'm physically attracted to the guy but he is seriously a terrible kisser. Almost everything about his technique was off-putting. I really like spending time with him and am attracted to him but his sexual advances were truly terrible. I am going out of state for a week and a half and am really torn on whether I should keep seeing this guy when I get back. We have a great time when were together but the sexual chemistry is so off for me.\nTL;DR:"}

As I peaked I felt I needed to be around my ex, both because he was sober and because he's all around very comforting to be around. After a period of intense sobbing (this was my first time using this particular drug) he managed to get me to confess.\n\nI told him I love him and that I desperately need him in my life, to which he responded that he loves me too and that since I moved in I've quickly become his best friend. We've spent most evenings together and apparently I've been more respectful of him and his gender identity than any of his other close friends. This brought me to my own personal revelation that since I graduated high school I've become increasingly distant from my own best friend, and that my feelings for my ex were partly because he filled a void my friend from high school was starting to leave.\n\nAfter a long discussion about the meaning of love and the difference between a romantic relationship and a relationship between friends, I resolved that I don't need a significant other, at least not now, and I would be happy having him as a best friend, something I hadn't realized I *did* need until then.\n\nJust a few minutes ago I asked him if his offer to let me live with him still stands, and he nodded. I told him I was unsure before, but now I'm 100% positive that I want to live with him, too. Not as a couple, but as best friends who have good living chemistry and respect each other's boundaries. I want to live with him, not out of some faint hope we might get back together, but because I don't want to live alone, and if I had to choose one person to say good morning to every day it would absolutely be him.\nTL;DR:"}

When we were still in college, we contributed an equal amount to this account. When we started working we contributed an amount relative to our wages are proportionate to eachother (for example, she would contribute $130USD and I $100).\n\nNow that we're getting married, it seems to make more sense to just dump everything together so we don't have the annoying issues of what to pay with which bank account, settling purchases,.. On the other hand, it makes sense that you have your own account and continue as we've done before (but with a substantial bigger contribution). \nWhen we'd get a mortgage to buy a house things'll get even more complicated, so I'd like to get a good financial arrangement in our relationship.\n\nWhat do other couples do?\nTL;DR:"}

I feel our conversations are mostly superficial. She responds mostly with closed ended responses and isn't great at all at maintaining a conversation. I want her to open up to me and really tell me how she's feeling because I feel this will create more of an emotional connection, but it's been getting frustrating. \n\nWhen we were first seeing each other, I thought she was playing hard to get with her short closed ended responses, but upon getting to know her better I realized she just lacks a personality.

Much to my dismay, I could not seem to find them in the car that dropped me off. I was surely stuck out of my house, but a small spat of luck came and the door that leads into the house from the garage was open! Alarms set, I went to sleep thinking nothing terrible of the key incident. --- 7:30am rolls around and my tired eyes roll to the clock, at which point I begin to freak out because work starts at 7:30 and I live 20 minutes away. I get dressed in a spat of fury, throwing clothes all over the room like a little kid and finding something to wear. When I finally put on my last shoe, I make my way to the pile of things that goes in my pocket. Missing are the keys, I am immediately reminded of the fact that they were lost. In a stream of adrenaline, I scour the room for them, knowing its a lost cause. I accept the fact that they are in one of my friends cars. Knowing this, I would not be able to get a phone call to any of them before 12pm, and especially no one would be able to deliver them to my house any time soon. I full-heartedly believe the best way to do things is honestly. At this point I realize I have to call in to work because I won't make it. I call the after hours number, because I work for a temp agency, and I'm supposed to call them, not the place I'm working for.

I also noticed that it doesn't fill quite to skin level, but yet slightly lower so only things like needles are able to pull out the dead skin.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Did I (20's M) do the right thing?\nPOST: I will make this short and sweet. I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years. We have actually been engaged for about half of that. We also have a two year old together. Basically she told me she wasn't happy and that she thought we should take a break to see if we miss each other. I told her that after seven years and a kid together that shouldn't even be an option and that she should know if she wants to be with me or not. So after her being very persistent with trying to tell me we need a break I ended the relationship. I love her and want to be a family but I just feel like after so long you should know who you want to spend the rest of your life with and I would think 7 years is plenty of time to figure that out. Was I right? \n\nAlso this is my first time posting so go easy on me with my writing. Thanks\nTL;DR:"}

One of those reasons (not the main) was the lack of sexual attraction. She was putting on weight and didn't feel the need to exercise. She said I should love her no matter her size. \n\nFast forward to last month, we have chatted and started talking and I see her back in the city where both of us moved from and she has added another 15-20 pounds. I was seriously so mad. I still really love this girl and have feelings, but the attraction is basically gone. I tried to be nice about it and she did the usual workout for a week then quit that she did when we were dating. I wasn't rude, but I was very up front in saying that in a long distance relationship there has to be a desire for sex with that person, otherwise it's just a friendship.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do. Like I said, I do love this girl. We've been through a lot together but if I can't look at you with sexual desire then i just don't know how a relationship could work. Especially a LD one.\nTL;DR:"}

Towards the end of last year my relationship with my ex was growing rockier and rockier, and we eventually broke up earlier this year. Shortly after that, Leo and I started a FWB type relationship. As we are now moving into a new apartment with 2 new housemates, we have decided to end it, however I am a bit concerned about how this is going to play out. \n\nFirstly, the sexual tension between us has not gone away, and even after Leo said we should stop (which I agreed with) he approached me again for sex just 2 days later. Secondly, I've always been relatively confused about what my feelings for Leo actually are, and I'm worried that I'm actually beginning to like him more than just a friend (which is why I'm doubly pleased we are ending our FWB thing), although if that is the case, it's definitely not too serious, just maybe a crush. So - how can I best move forward from this non-relationship? I can't exactly actively avoid Leo, and obviously we are going to need to establish rock hard boundaries in order not to make our new housemates feel uncomfortable. Has anyone been in a similar situation before that can give input as to the best way to move forward?\nTL;DR:"}

But my sister is still living in the house for some reasons that I do not fucking care. She always COMPLAINS and talks too much but what I baoslutely hate about her is that she's EXTREMELY negative.

I've liked this girl since grade 3 so this was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. She's nice, smart, attractive, everything. Maybe we could connect or something and maybe progress our friendship into something else.\n\nAnyway, at prom we didn't really talk much. I felt like starting conversation but it was all too awkward being that we were friends and we also worked together side by side at the same store. At the after party, I drove my friends to McDonald's to get some food before we drank. I called my date and asked if she wanted anything and I ended up spending $25 on chicken nuggets (she is nowhere close to being fat btw). Bringing these back to her was the most we talked all night. I was not really drunk (I get really emotional after 4 or some beers  but can still do everything fine such as walking and conversing to a certain degree). At 4am that night everyone was asleep except for maybe 12 people out of the possibly 100/200+ that were there. Myself, my prom date, her friends, and my friends, and the party host's mom and dad (coolest motherfuckers I've ever met). I of course was nowhere close to talking to her though. She eventually left with her friends and I didn't even say goodbye nor did I give her a kiss. I didn't sleep at all that night because I didn't know if I fucked up or if she was cool with it cuz we were just friends and that's how she wants it. \n\nSo yeah I don't know anymore, just feel like shit.

I responded with \"yeah, I really relish the opportunity to be overloaded/stressed out\". Not my finest moment but he seems to have missed the snark. I'm honestly just so fed up with him and this is part of an ongoing pattern of passive aggressive bullshit. \n\nA few hours later, he posted a link \"why do procrastinators procrastinate\" onto my timeline. I really want to say something like \"dad, please stop posting things like this every time I vent about uni\", or \"I'm an adult and perfectly capable of identifying and working on my weaknesses, thanks\", but I know that's probably a stupid thing to do.

Help\nPOST: Let me start by saying I know all the lack of proof of true information on the previous owner leaves this dog more open to the chance of having parvo but anyway..\nI got my puppy Ozzy two days ago now, from an owner on craigslist who was selling two puppies who were apparently caged outside in all weather, they convinced the owner they could give the dogs a better home so he surrendered the pups to the person i got them from. She admitted to me that they were in bad condition and covered in fleas and they have been putting flea medication on the puppies bodies and bathing them. When I picked him up he was just bathed and in the past two days I've only found 2 fleas walking around on him. Still using frontline. I have a vet appointment for Wednesday morning (two days from now) He seems in perfect health, eating all his food, trying to steal our food, pooping whole and dark with no signs of worms or blood, but just today his poop started becoming more watery I assumed its because he was probably on a different food before and this one isn't going through his system correctly. He drinks a lot of water and whenever he wants. Definitely still has full appetite and thirst, would never suspect a thing. Today the original owner texted me and said his sister (who he was always with until 2 nights ago so about 72+ hours ago now) has parvo and started pooping blood. She claimed she \"just got it\" which doesnt make sense to me but what do I know. She went on to say that puppy was treated more harshly and in way worse condition than the puppy I have as if that would make me feel better. I don't feel like waiting two more days to find out, do you think he has parvo?\nI literally didnt notice til I just typed this question out that theres no way of anyone knowing til I go to the vet. Sorry just needed to type this out to someone. I also have two other dogs who are completely up to date on their shots.\nAny feedback or opinions on anything would be awesome\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: Am I confusing my cats if they're not always allowed in the room?\nPOST: We recently had to move in with friends because of circumstances. It's a nice big house so our two cats are better off here than in the rather small apartment we lived in before. The problem is, everyone smokes inside, in the living room. There's one non-smoking roommate but she mostly stays in her room. So I've banned the cats from the living room when anyone's smoking in there. We leave the windows open and allow the cats in at night after everyone's gone to bed and the room is sufficiently aired out. When I'm home alone however, I don't smoke inside and let the cats snuggle with me in the living room, like they were used to. Now I worry I might be confusing them as to when they may or may not enter the room. One of them in particular tends to meow at the door when it's closed. She's a very affectionate cat so I like to take advantage whenever possible to get in some snuggle time.\n\nI wonder if it would be better to teach them that the living room is off-bounds at all times, or keep doing what I do now. I'm the only one that cares about not smoking inside/around the cats so I'm not going to force everyone outside. I also can't stay in our bedroom all day with the cats as there's no heating in that part of the house and it really gets too cold for me (cats don't mind that part though). They can currently enter any other room in the house, except one of the bedrooms as the occupant is allergic, so they have plenty of space to roam.\nTL;DR:"}

It all started when my laptop broke and he said I could use his until mine was fixed so anyway I go into downloads folder to open a pic Id downloaded and it opens and I see there is LITERALLY thousands and thousands of Porn Pics (easily over 100,000) I feel upset then feel bad for snooping (even though that wasn't my intention). Later that night I mention I'd seen it by accident, and he's not bothered that I saw it \"its from ages ago\" he claims. At this stage I don't really care as I know pretty much everyone looks at porn. Later on in the week chrome crashes so I boot up history to load my pages up and then boom I see just constant porn pages in it. At this stage I do the wrong thing but I couldn't help myself and I start to snoop and I just keep looking and looking through the history getting more and more upset because I realise that basically any time I'm not in the same room or I'm out of the house he's looking at porn and downloading/archiving it. Its soo much that I can see what time I get up in the morning (because the porn viewing stops) and then when I leave (because it starts again). I've never had a problem with ex's looking at porn but this just feels excessive and makes me feel crap about myself because of the excessiveness.

I share the downstairs with a girl, and about 5 people live upstairs.

We share a hall which my bedroom is off and a front door.\n\nAnyway, every month or so one of these upstairs people (I'm assuming) gets really drunk and comes home after a night out and starts pounding on the front door, which is right beside my bedroom. The first time it happened I was really terrified as I didn't know who it was, just that there was someone trying very hard to get into my house by banging hard on the door in the middle of the night and fiddling with the keyhole. The only reason I now assume someone upstairs is doing it is because it keeps happening, and cos eventually someone comes along (from somewhere else outside) and lets them in - I assume another upstairs resident back later from her night out.\n\nIt happened last night and went on for 3 hours! It gets really scary being alone in my room and hearing someone basically about to break the door down. The reason I don't let them in is because firstly, I can't be sure if it is someone from upstairs. Secondly, whoever it is clearly sounds very drunk and aggressive. Thirdly, I'm just not comfortable opening the front door out onto the street myself in the middle of the night. I'm 5\"3, there's no latch, and there was a murder five minutes from my house just two days ago.\n\nI have told my landlady who has (according to her) spoken to them numerous times now based on my complaints. But nothing seems to have changed. I do consider calling the police but because the house is so informally divided I'm afraid they'll think I'm just wasting their time if it does turn out to be a reaident of upstairs. Who rings the police about a person trying to get into their own home? So I'm really not sure what to do about the situation. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

Now, for whatever reason, due to either negligence of the person on the lease or quite possibly some shifty tactics from the buildings management, those individuals have been evicted from the apartment for rent owed totalling over $1000. To their knowledge the eviction notice was not served to anyone living in the apartment before the eviction process.\n\nOn the day of eviction, a seemingly normal day, two city marshalls request access to the apartment, tell everyone inside they have to leave and give them 5 minutes to collect their belongings and that the landlord has the right to put the rest of their belongings in storage. Let us also assume that their inventory of possessions within the apartment is not exhaustive or accurate in reflecting the conditions of the tenants' property. They slap the eviction notice on the door and our tenants are on the street.\n\nThe storage facility wants mucho dinero to get the property out of storage and may also require the tenants to sign a release form which prevents the ex-tenants from suing the storage company for any lost/stolen/broken items.\n\nIs there a best course of action from here?\n\nWhat can a citizen do to protect his/herself here?\n\nsidenote: Although the leaser was not super vigilant to prevent this from happening, he/she has been getting significant pressure from the building to move out. The apartment has received eviction notices before, but the leaser has always gotten some kind of extension in court so it was never an issue (after the first eviction notice the subletter's fears had been assuaged). Also the building has been doing shady things to other rent controlled tenants of the building like not accepting rent checks/not documenting receipt of those rent checks properly.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm at a loss as to how to approach him about this, and how I should be approaching our relationship. \n\nI want to know if he's open to the possibility of relocating down the road should the opportunity arise, but I'm very aware that our relationship is young and asking him to answer a question like that is unfair to him - it's a question he's probably not prepared to answer. Hell, asking him to move at all feels unfair considering he's established in a city he loves with friends, family, and his own career (I should note that I'm not being completely selfish here, as his career is more \"mobile\" than mine - he can find a job pretty much anywhere). There's also the fact that this is all still up in the realm of possibility, and everything is very much up in the air right now.\n\nSo part of me wants to know if us moving out of state together would ever be an option for him, but part of me wants to keep this all to myself because there's nothing certain - either with our relationship or my career. But it's going to be really hard for me to move forward in our relationship knowing that the possibility exists that I'll be leaving in the somewhat near future, possibly without him, not to mention it's unfair to him for us to continue to become emotionally attached.\n\nAs you can tell from my rambling, I'm all over the place with this and could really use some outsider perspective and advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I was planning on asking this second girl on a date soon, but yesterday afternoon the first girl told me that she liked me and was planning on breaking up with her boyfriend. She asked if I'd be her boyfriend, and I agreed provided her boyfriend didn't take it too badly. \n\nThing is, I was so close to asking the second girl out, and now I seem to be caught up in a relationship I don't know I want to be in. But I can't turn her down now because I've already said yes. It doesn't help that the girl I'm now dating knows I like(d) her friend, so I can't really end it down the line and ask her friend out, without looking like a jerk.\nShe (my girlfriend) was pretty clear that she has strong feelings for me, and I know it would hurt if I had turned her down, so I felt compelled to say yes. To be honest, I like this girl a lot, and feel I can be happy with her, but after getting pretty close to this other girl whom I'd had a crush on for a while I just feel... maybe let-down?\n\n As mentioned, fairly generic and bland issue. Not really expecting advice, as it's my 'problem' to deal with. Just wanted to get it off my chest, really.\nTL;DR:"}

About 20 minutes later I look up and notice the sign says the train leaves in 1 minute, so I look around but I cant see it. I think to myself \"that's a little odd\" because usually the train stays for 5 minutes before leaving, so I walk up the platform only to see the my train, doors closing and about to take off. I run up the platform frantically waving my arms around, hoping the train driver will see me, but nope, the bugger just cruises off with my hope of getting some rest and the next ep of AHS. Turns out the train was 2 carriages shorter than usual so it pulled up further down from where I was. \n\nI then waited until 5am for the next one because it was too far to walk and I couldn't afford a cab to my car which was 45 minutes away.\nTL;DR:"}

She is my best friend at that school, and we hang out all the time--almost literally.  Usually, it's fine, but there's a catch; she is really hard to get along with.  \n\nShe is irritable almost all of the time, is very negative, and high-maintenance.  Honestly, I'm one of the few people who can stand her and stand up to her when she's being unreasonable.  Even so, sometimes I feel like I need to pick my battles and walk on egg-shells with her, and I always think I'm one false move from yet another fight where she gets melodramatic and break us off for five minutes to a few hours, but invariably comes crying back.\n\nWhen we're not fighting, she is always trying to make plans for the future (read children and marriage) or have sex.  While I don't mind her higher-than-average sex-drive, sometimes, she is angry when we don't sleep together or if I want to do something else together.  It's tiring.  I've tried talking to her about it, but it always degenerates into a fight.\n\nDespite that, though, I don't want to leave her; she's my best friend.  I realize that I'm her first boyfriend, and she's been trying to work on her issues.  It hasn't been too much of a problem as of late, but I've started to hate when she texts me, calls me, IMs me, or asks me to come see her.  I've even started making some work for myself so that I don't have to deal with her as much.\n\nOrdinarily, if I weren't at such a small school, went to some school in a city, or in many classes with her, I would have left her.  I think I've been more than patient, but I really don't want to lose my best friend and weekend buddy.\nTL;DR:"}

It was dumb of me I will admit but they had been cutting my hours and the extra money was something I needed if I were to pay my bills and rent on time. \n\nThen three months later my girlfriend of three years broke up with me because she said she didn't see me doing enough to find a new job, when I was applying to as many jobs as I possible could.

I'm not even confident in what I say, because I am very conscious of the major social change. My voice is weak and shaky, and I even stutter. When the hell did that start?! The ease of social interaction has left me, and I feel excluded from the groups I used to be a major part of. \n\nI know that it's normal to lose contact with everyone when in a relationship, but I was not expecting the loss of sociability. \n\nHow can I get it back, and have it become second-nature once more?\n\nI'll address a potential point:* Why do you want to go back to the person you were? You should become better and more than you were...\"*\n\nI would accept that, if what I had become weren't so much worse than what I was before. I liked the person that I used to be, and people enjoyed being around that person. Now I can tell that people aren't as invested when they are around me. Conversations are incredibly short, and never personal. It just became a huge domino effect, and the first domino was noticing that change. The more I thought about it, the more I noticed it. This could be interpreted as a self-fulfilling prophecy, I know.\nTL;DR:"}

I said why not and started texting the girl. Things seemed to be going well, an we went on two dates that went very well by my standards.\n   \n  Now here is the problem. We don't have any classes, so we don't get to see each other very often. Her locker is near mine, but she is almost always talking to her friends that i don't really know, an I don't feel like it's right for me to intrude. These aren't necessarily huge issues, but she is also involved in alot of extracurriculars such as debate, so I haven't been able to go on a date with her in about two and a half weeks. \n    But we both have phones right, so no worries? Not exactly. I seem to always have to be the one to text her first. I tried an experiment and went four days without sending her a message, and I didn't get a single one from her. And then sometimes we will be in the middle of a conversation an she will just read my message and not reply. For hours. Until I text her again the next day and she acts like nothing happened.\n      But when we are actually together she's is very sweet, and can hold extremely engaging conversations, yet those times are few and far between, and I just feel like I'm putting more effort into making those times happen, and the relationship in general.\n\n   Now reddit, this is where you come in. I need to address these issues with her and I could really use your thoughts on this situation, as well as how to broach the subject without sounding needy and whiny, and without sounding accusatory and angry. Any ideas?\nTL;DR:"}

I have gotten the impression the last few nights when we were drinking together that she was into me. Friday night we had a party at my place, went to the bar and probably only stayed for half hour before we left together, as she wanted food.  So we went back to her place, hung out and talked for a while then she invited me to her room. We had sex, or at least tried before we both gave up (too drunk) and she says \"do you want to just cuddle tonight and try again in the morning?\" .  So flash forward, we both get woken up ~ 8:00 and we just talk and she was supper cuddly, hand holding, kissing etc, we had sex again and, while she kept telling me not to leave, I left around 10:00.  We agreed not to tell anyone, so i've kept it a secret from my roommates.\n\nAnyways, that was 2 nights ago, she joined us all for lunch on Saturday, I didn't say too much to her but that's my nature anyways, especially in groups. What I want to know is if all her cuddling and the morning sex would be signs that she'd be interested in doing something again.  \n\nThe thing is, she is a wild girl. I've always thought too crazy for me, but I actually enjoyed talking the morning after. I don't know what I want but I want to touch base with her so we can figure it out. What is your suggestion for best message to send her if I want to figure out what she wants / thinks of the night? I'd be interested in FWB sort of relationship, but would be open to the idea of getting to know her better / dating too. It could also be possible it was just a one night stand with her... \n\n*Didn't get her number but have her on facebook & tinder\nTL;DR:"}

The interview went great, and I'm more than qualified for the job I applied for. The person that interviewed me was the director of nursing and she basically told me I was in, so I filled out some paperwork. I went to turn it in to a different person and she said I would have to take a drug test, which they do in-house. I told her up front that I take adderall for ADHD and it would come up positive for amphetamines, and I've never had trouble finding employment for the 5-6 years I've been taking it.\n\nI took the 5-panel pee test and sure enough it came back positive for amphetamines. I told her I could have my doctor fax a script over, but she said it was the policy of the owner not to hire anyone that fails the drug test under any circumstances. I asked to speak to an administrator or the owner him/herself but she declined. I tried to talk to the person that interviewed me but she was busy so I just left a message with my friend that got me in.\n\nI got a call back today, and the director wanted me to have my doctor fax my prescription over. She said she would do everything she could to get me hired, but it is the owner's policy not to hire anyone that failed the drug test regardless of the circumstances.

We had a lot of issues while we were dating and engaged that we managed to work through, but our marriage has been pretty smooth sailing as far as getting along goes. We don't argue much and we're able to communicate our differences well. We just can't seem to communicate the rest.\n\nI feel like we act more like best friends/roommates than lovers. I know that marriage is hard work and that there are ups and downs, and phases where you seem to connect more than others. It just seems like this disconnected phase has gone on for a few years and he gets gradually more distant. Every few months I'll try to talk to him about it - we'll both be in tears with him promising to open up and saying that he knows he acts differently toward me. Eventually I stopped reaching out because the whole process of opening up and seeing no change was discouraging, so now I'm holding back, too.\n\nI love him very much and we don't see splitting up as an option in marriage (unless major distrust/harm is involved) - not that it's reached that point, but we do want to work on it, we just don't know how and what we used to have seems so far gone now. Our sex life is really suffering, too, and our son and this sickly pregnancy don't help that area.\n\nWe've tried a marriage retreat (helped for a while and gave us some good communication tools, but was really more of a band-aid), and a few counseling sessions. Unfortunately, his work makes it impossible for any kind of regular counseling, but we can shift things around for a tune-up now and then.\n\nAny ideas? I would like to add that I'm always the one trying to talk about it and express the distance, even though he acknowledges it at times.

This is partly because I just find it exhausting to see multiple people at a time, partly because I just don't get that many offers, and partly because I genuinely like him and don't feel the need to shop around at the moment. But because we aren't exclusive and it's been such a short time, I'm pretty sure he's seeing someone else.

His dad dies (murdered?) and he gets abducted by his father's viking like men and dragged to some villa/castle in the middle of arctic nowhere.  As it turns out, dad was some sort of leader (the whole world, I seem to remember, is in a state of war but the sub plots elude me) who was possessed with demonic/draconic powers.  When he kicked the bucket, our hero inherited said powers *cough*curse*cough* and becomes a pretty badass demon/dragon thing with blue blood.\n\nUnfortunately, this requires him to feed on things.  His dad had a preference to women.  (mm, women).  Our hero, of course, then proceeds to fall in love with some witch/castle maid and attempts to not eat her in the process of dealing with his new found demon psyche.

While we watched some TV I kept on trying to bring it up, and he said we'd talk sober. \n\nThe next day, I brought it up to him, and he said he couldn't make any promises because he just makes lots of jokes all the time.

We are currently going no contact, and are both wanting to move on. I especially have had issues with coping with our breakup, and dealing with this in a healthy way. I am trying really hard to move forward and learn from stupid mistakes I have made.\n\nMy best friend, however, keeps bringing up and talking to my ex. During the time we were dating they became really close friends. This would typically be fine, except it is really affecting me. For example, last night she posted a picture of us on instagram before going out to a party. She messaged me the next morning saying \"[Ex] liked my picture! He would of seen you looking super hot.\" I know she is just trying to make me feel better, but consistent comments like these are making it really difficult for me. I have talked to her about this several times, and have even said I don't know if I can continue a friendship with her while she remains so close to him, and is always bringing him up.\n\nIt is very difficult to trust that she is not saying cruel things to him about me because she thinks it is what he wants to hear. I understand that it must be difficult for her to remain close with the both of us, but I just feel like in this circumstance, especially due to the extremely messy nature of our breakup, it is just not possible. From her perspective, I know she is trying to do the right thing by both of us, and is currently going through a tough breakup herself. Am I in the wrong for wanting to cut contact and abandoning her when technically she has done nothing wrong?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm getting my mortgage through my credit union and they have a promotion that if you use a preferred realtor then your origination fee is waived - which is how I was put in contact with my realtor.  However, she doesn't seem very familiar with the program so we've hit a lot of roadblocks now that I'm closing on a home in getting that fee waived.\n\nThe latest is the title search.  The lender will only waive my origination fee if I use their lawyer for the title search.  My loan officer called me 2 days ago to let me know that my realtor had ordered a title search and that the lawyer had contacted her (the loan officer) and if I wanted the origination fee waived I'd have to call him off.  So I texted my realtor and told her, she said no problem.  Today, I got an email saying that the lawyer that my realtor had ordered had already ordered the title search and that I still must pay him.  \n\nI did sign a paper with his name on it the day that I made the initial offer, but my realtor told me that all of those names could change (which I know, means nothing really).  \n\nAs I said, it's a fixer upper.  So there's been a lot of potential that I'd want to back out until after the inspection.  We had the inspection, I'm asking for concession and we haven't come to agreement on those concessions.  So, I'm even more irritated the the title search was already ordered because my realtor said that if I back out I'm only out the due diligence fee and the cost of the inspection fee.  Now it's also the title search and who knows what else!\n\nSo, if there any scenario where I'm not responsible for this title search that I didn't want?  Can I just tell him to bill me (so that I don't have to pay it as I'm also draining my bank account to close on this house)?  It will be about $1,000.    \n\nI really didn't want this title search so soon, I have month until closing!\nTL;DR:"}

Any tips and/or advice is appreciated!\n\nA little bit about us: we have been going out for 4 months. Everything has been great so far. We have fought once, and we both apologized and moved on pretty quickly. He is sweet, caring, and we get along well. The only thing that bugs me on a deep level about him is that he is a BIG introvert, where I am SUPER social. So we have very different friends. \n\nA little bit about the parents: they are really nice people, a bit over protective given that I am the only child. I am a bit afraid that they might give my boyfriend a bit of a hard time, just because they always think I deserve the best of the best. \n\nThe boyfriend and I have very similar cultural backgrounds (one parent is American, the other one moved here from Asia), so cultures clashing is not a huge concern.\n\nIs there any rules or etiquette (on both side) that we should be aware of? He bought them tea as a gift for letting him stay at their place for the weekend.\n\nI just really want them to like each other.

I have been with my current guy for 3 years. Things haven't always been perfect but we do have a lot of fun together. The sex is great and we have a great mental and emotional connection. He is planning on proposing and I do love him and want to be with him.\n\nHaving said all of that, his friendship with his ex-girlfriend drives me crazy. His ex gf lives abroad across the international date line and due to his weird schedule they gchat a lot late at night. I've read their gchats (the ones he hasn't deleted since he know it bothers me and doesn't want me to see it) and most are pretty innocent/tame. My guy is a bit of a lone wolf and doesn't have a lot of friends so part of me feels bad for wanting to prevent him from having a friendship with this girl since I know she's supportive to him.\n\nHowever, it's not the innocent Gchats that bother me, it's the frequent Skyping and requests for money (that's a separate post, and something he had promised me would end and has ended, I think...) that really drives me insane. Idle gchat is one thing but Skyping crosses a line in my opinion. We fought about this before and he agreed that it was too intimate and that it would stop. It hasn't, I think he won't ever give up the attention he gets from her.\n\nThis has been an ongoing issue for us; the last time we talked about it he told me he was going to write her an email and tell her the deal. That she was wedging herself in between us and that it had to end. But he hasn't written her to tell her this and at this point I doubt he ever will. I feel like I'm being controlling by bringing this up again. When I saw that they had been Skyping despite my repeatedly telling him that it hurt me was a real blow. Maybe I'm making too big of a deal here and am being too controlling. I don't even know anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

My SO comes up pale faced and told the guy's DD that he had fallen down the stairs, and he was pretty fucked up. So I go downstairs to what looks like to be a murder scene. Blood everywhere. He is sitting on the last step with like a whole roll of toilet paper over his face. Instant buzz kill, I had beer and shots, but I knew like instantly what to do. I grabbed a roll of paper towels and calmly asked him if I could clean him up so I could see what was going on. After I got the blood running down his face and arms cleaned up, I asked him if I could see where it hurts. I know, talking to him like he is 3, but he removed the toilet paper from his face was the deepest cut I have ever seen above his eyebrow.

She ended up missing a few days of school because of how sick she was (and had to cancel another date of ours), which put her behind on her studies. \n\nHer getting sick combined with her now freaking out about how much work she's missed for school has basically put the brakes on our communication.

But the new development of actual biting is what kind of threw me over the edge. (It's been an everlasting battle regardless...). He will also bark endlessly every time the A/C clicks on until you tell him to hush. Besides the constant barking, he's a very sweet dog and will get along with everyone as long as you let him sniff your hand or throw a toy for him at least once. \n\nThe new papillon, the show dog, has over the course of time adopted these same symptoms but turned out worse. Where the older dog will generally only bark when anyone touches the front door or bedroom doors, the younger dog will now rush at you and bark and growl regardless of what door you're opening/closing. Opening the bathroom door and stepping out is a serious offense to this little guy... \n\nEveryone in her house has mixed feelings about how you train a dog, and completely lacks the motivation to even begin training.

On that other hand my fiance doesn't enjoy the company of children and is sure he doesn't want any of his own since they would be a burden on finances and leisure time among other things. \n\nWe know this is considered a deal breaker by most, but we love each other so much and really don't want to break up when everything else is so great. We've talked about it a lot and can't come to a conclusion we can accept. As I said I have become less sure about wanting children as I've gotten older and with the possibility of losing the love of my life I feel pretty ambivalent about having children now. Furthermore I also think there are many practical reasons why not having children is a good idea, ranging from the increasingly high cost of living to the world's overpopulation issues. \n\nSo my question is: is it possible to choose not to have children against maternal instincts without damaging the relationship? Or does it always end up with one person resenting the other?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: I think my job might have been cutting my wages\nPOST: I had been working as a manager for the last 7 months at a small franchise business (no longer working there), working multiple 12 hour shifts every week. I started receiving checks with no overtime pay for going over 8 hours a day. When I asked them about it, they had said they didn't need to pay it. I thought that was weird, so I went to my states .gov website and found a small PDF that states Monday-Friday we get overtime pay for 8+hours. Saturday is time and a half, and Sunday is double time. Now, I'm not very acquainted with business ethics or the laws of fair employment, but if that's the case, how can I confirm it and take further action to receive the overtime pay I didn't receive?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What's the worst gift you've ever gotten for Christmas? I'll start....\nPOST: I remember when I was 8 years old; I desperately wanted to get an N64, but I also wanted to know if santa claus was real.  So, I didnt tell my parents what I wanted for christmas and I hoped really hard for one.  I woke up on christmas morning to find a big box in my room.  I tore it open as quickly as I could and with as much hope as an 8 year old could muster.  Inside was a Goofy telephone. \n\nI remember being really really sad, but I tried to keep it together.  My parents hooked up the phone and made me use it.  The phone rang and I answered it.  The receiver was way too big for my tiny head so I couldnt even use it.  That was the tipping point.  When I realized I couldn't use it, I broke down and started to cry, like big hysterical WTF tears.  \n\nSanta Claus was fake, I had a useless phone, and I had parents that thought little kids wanted a telephone for christmas.  \n\nThe worst part though is that my parents own a toy story. Though they mainly sold knock-offs (Dragoon-Ball, Valtron, Power Fighters,  etc to name a few from memory), I think the 8 year old version of me would've appreciated them more than the telephone.)\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: (Quarter) Life Crisis\nPOST: Hello reddit, this is my first post. I have a problem which I thought you could help me with. Throughout my high school years, I thought that making friends was simple, you just had to be friendly with people, get to know them, hangout, and with time, gain mutual trust.\nRecently, however (first year of university, 18 years) I realized that it doesn't work this way. Or at least it didn't work this way.\nI began doubting the trust between me and all (or the vast majority) of my friends. Statistically speaking, chances are the problems from my end, since so many people can't be like this. What I mean by \"like this\" is hard for me to describe, but.. it's as if they have no conscience. For example, numerous times have I shared a secret with my best friend of 10 years, and he always seems to tell people, shrugging it off as no big deal or \"no one cares about this story, no big deal.. don't worry\". This happens all the time, yet they fail to see the problem.\nFurthermore, I constantly had this feeling that if I stopped initiating contact with my friends, who I perceived to be close friends; hardly anyone would try to see what happened to me. So I tried not to contact them, but within a week, it was clear that they weren't going to contact me. So I tried to consciously forget about this problem, but it's always been there.\nThe question is: Am I just not a close friend to most of the people I considered close friends? Or is it that they all don't know the meaning of trust? Should I confront each friend individually, and talk to them about this problem? Or should I just move along and find some other friends. I'm lost\u2026\nTL;DR:"}

I didn't know the reason either TBH, so I answered with \"I don't know\", but I think she thought I was lying to her or something, the vibe changed for the worse after that. Then the same thing happened *again* with a different girl.  \n\nLater on I got to thinking and I figured out I do have reasons, but they're long and complicated and delve into parts of my life that would dampen the mood for sure (or mine at least). I've had a turbulent childhood, that's the gist of it. \n\nSo, this brings me back to my original question of how to respond to that or avoid the topic completely?

His birthday is tomorrow.\nPOST: Hey reddit, so I'll just get to it. \nMy nephew is eight years old, tomorrow he will be nine. He is an only child and generally gets tired of being around his friends after about an hour or two of hanging out. Sometimes he doesn't want to hang out at all. He really is a sweet kid, but lately he's been a little difficult. He's been talking back, crying about doing chores/homework/not getting his way. Now that's not the problem because I think most kids act this way at some point but today something different happened. Today (while I was out of the house for a few minutes) he got annoyed with his friends so he grabbed a kitchen knife and told them to leave. Obviously he got in trouble and was told how wrong this was. We also had him apologize to his friends. We explained to him that violence like that is never the answer (unless of course self defense) and that if he were an adult he would be in jail and other things of that nature. However, his birthday is tomorrow. We're having a birthday party and going to a water park. As his aunt I'm a little uneasy about going through with it because of his actions today.

After college we made the move and difficult transition to a different town and a different place. At that point things took a sad turn as she began to drift apart. She no longer loved me which came as a huge blow. Although I have made strides as a person and professional since our breakup over two years ago, I am still struck on a daily basis with deep sadness and depression. It scares me that I still struggle with coping with the loss. I have dated but I have yet to call another woman mine since. I struggle with attraction and intimacy now which is even more terrifying. The last few days I have had several spells of horrible heartache (that old fashion feeling when a chill rolls down your chest when a thought or memory of your ex creeps into your mind). I feel weak for writing this right now but it feels good to put feeling and emotion into words. I consider myself an open individual so I figured putting this here cannot hurt. \n\nI am so scared this feeling will continue to haunt me.\nTL;DR:"}

George and his family furnished the house to make it easier for George's roommates to live there without spending extra money. \n\nOne of the renters,  lets name him Greg,  was a bit unhappy with the living room seating arrangement. He changed it into what he though was a more appropriate television viewing seating arrangement without telling George. \n\nWhen George came back, he was a bit confused about the seating arrangement and asked Greg why he changed it. Instead of explaining that the couches were positioned to see the television better,  Greg blew up on George by saying \"This house is my house and I don't need your permission to do anything inside of it\" and stormed off. \n\nGeorge felt pretty upset by the comment, as it felt incredibly rude to him. George then asked me for advice on how to help him deal with Greg. \n\nAlthough the fight is pretty unimportant,  am I right to assume that Greg does in fact Not own any part of the house as he is just a renter?

The highlights are that F now thinks that E is a horrible person, Forbids E from talking to her BF (the two are really good friends) and thinks she's done absolutely nothing wrong, sadly everyone except for me and E's BF took F's side, most of them only taking her side because they are her friends and actually do not know the whole story.\nTL;DR:"}

The first 1 1/2 hour of my 4 hour shift went pretty well, (it was just basic stuff like cleaning trays, replenishing the ice for the soda fountain, and changing trash bags, etc.), but around hour 2 it started to get incredibly busy and this is where my social anxiety kicks in.

Well, against my best judgment I texted her again (I HATE double texting) and asked her if everything was alright because it had been a few days since I'd heard from her.\n\nWell long story short she apologized profusely because she's just been insanely busy lately. I told her that it was all good but that I was also gonna be crazy busy this week because work is giving me more hours but I would still like to get dinner if we both get some free time. Her response was \"okay! I'll let you know when I get some free time.\"\n\nSo... yeah. Pretty anti-climatic resolution. Not sure where to go from here (since she was too busy to remember to text me the first time, I don't have high hopes that she'll remember this time either, nor do I know how I'm supposed to handle it if she forgets *again*)\n\nBut yeah. She wasn't intentionally ignoring me, and I'm still not sure she's overly happy with the idea, but she didn't say no straight up, so I guess that's a good thing?\nTL;DR:"}

We recently got back together a few months ago and things are well I guess.\n\n I'm having thoughts that maybe I keep getting back with her because I feel like I won't be able to feel how I feel about her for anyone else. Or that I'm scared of being alone, she keeps bringing up the subject of getting married and I don't want to get married. She knows this as I tell her every time.\n\n I feel like either we want different things in life or that maybe I don't feel how I think I do about her. I wouldn't question any of this if I did right?\n\nAlso I feel like I have so much invested into this relationship that I'm stuck in a way. Back in 2012 she was pregnant and had a miscarriage. Then in 2013 again but it implanted on the outside of her fallopian tubes? And she had to get an abortion as the doctor said it had low chance of survival and could harmful to her as well. \nWeve always been there for each other and we tell each other we love each other everyday. I've also recently started therapy for depression and anxiety but after a while I feel like i think these things more and more.\n\n I don't know what to do, or what to think and I figure I'd post here to see aome other opinions.

Our relationship isn't at all in jeopardy but I have noticed this rising resentment and would like to address it if I can.\n\nBefore we were even married I had made it clear that I absolutely hate cooking. I hate everything about getting or providing food. I expressed that I would have the expectation that she handle everything from beginning to end regarding food. If I could survive without ever eating I would but I can't.\n\nI know that sounds bad but I more than made up for it. I told her I would do every household chore she asked me to do. I'd do all the laundry. I would do nearly everything around the house and the only thing I wanted nothing to with was food. I don't even mind if she doesn't cook something. I'll just make myself a bowl of cereal as long as she had done the shopping.\n\nThis has worked pretty well for 7 years but I can sense a rising resentment in her that she always has to worry about the food. Nothing serious. No ultimatums, just comments here and there that make it clear she's unhappy with the food situation.\n\nI'm not quite certain how to address this yet. It kind of irritates me because I handle so much other stuff around the house I really don't feel like what I've asked for is unreasonable. I will do just about *everything else* but shop for food and cook.\n\nI don't think she feels overworked. She works part time. So it must be something else.

We were together for about 4 months. I really fell in love with him because he had everything that I looked for in a guy. We had said our I love yous to each other. Everything seemed totally fine. I had talked to him about me having a hard time opening up and being vulnerable with people, but he said I should open up more to him because I could trust him and we could talk about my problems. I did and I told him everything that was on my heart. Then literally a few days later (after brushing me off for a few days) he finally answered my phone call at sometime after midnight and basically said \"I don't have time for you, sorry\" and dumped me. I was devistated. I had trusted this man with my deepest feelings that he was asking me for! \n\nAfter a few days I messaged him asking him what the real reason for the break up was. Something was off and I wanted to hear the truth so I could move on. He wrote me a long message saying that he didn't realize how busy his life would be with his full time job and family stuff. He said, he was busy already when we met and our relationship was more of a convenience. \n\nThat hurts so bad still to this day. All I can think about is how he didn't have time for me and I was just a convenient girl to be with at that time. That cuts me so deep and I've started getting depressed over it. \n\nHow can I bounce back from this? It really hurts my self worth.

I drove the 2.5 hours to her town and we hit it off really well. In fact things went so well I made a move. She told me that she was extremely into me but just got out of a long term relationship and wanted to wait a bit. Given my age and mentality at the time I normally would have just walked away from the situation then. Instead I said \"That's fine, take all the time you need. You let me know when you are ready. Just kiss me or tell me. I want to make sure you are ready so I won't make a move no matter how tempted I am.\"\n\nFor the next several months I go to see her often. There are plenty of great opportunities to make a move and many times that she is putting down all the signals that she wants me to. I refrain because i said I would wait for verbal communication or direct action on her part.\n\nOne visit I go up there and her roommate tells me that she started seeing some guy she just met last week. That this man just aggressively pursued  her and she went for it. I confront her and she admits it but didn't want to tell me because she still has feelings for me. Says she didn't want to hurt my feelings and all that normal cliche crap you can expect to hear. She also said that she was ready for me to make a move weeks ago but I never did.\n\nI called her out on that BS by reminding her I was waiting for her. This isn't a situation where she forgot either, I would bring it up every once in awhile throughout the 4 months we were spending time together. Not enough to be annoying but just enough to reminder her I was waiting. Left after our conversation and never looked back. Still missed out on something because I should have acted on her nonverbal cues instead of just going by what she was said verbally.\nTL;DR:"}

If there is a better place to ask this question, please direct me there!\n\nOn to the actual question...\n\nOn Friday, my girlfriend and I adopted a 3-year-old cat from her grandmother as we moved into our new apartment. We set her litter box up in the spare bedroom along with a bowl of water, wet, and dry food (the same brand she ate at grandma's house) and have been keeping her shut in this room. \n\nAt first she was understandably extremely scared of us and cowered into the corner, but we tried to spend time in the room just talking to her and getting her used to our presence. She began to warm up to us and when we sit in the room for a few minutes, she'll come up to us and let us pet her for as long as we want. Yesterday we even got her to play with some toys we put out. I've cleaned her litter box every day so far, and she has been \"doing her business\" in there.\n\nThe concerning part is that she has not eaten since the morning we picked her up (Friday, Aug 21st). We have tried giving her fresh wet food on a few occasions and have offered her treats. She sniffs them a little bit and then seems uninterested. Last night she licked her wet food when we set it out but then turned away.\n\nI've googled the issue and read many responses about some cats needing a long time (weeks in some cases) to come out of their hiding spots. All of them said that when they feel comfortable, usually at night, they will come out to eat and \"do their business.\" This just seems very odd to me, because she is obviously getting comfortable enough with us to come out of hiding, but still won't eat.\n\nThis turned out really long, but my question is should we be concerned? When should we contact our Vet to get some suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}

Lately one thing has been hindering the last part.\n\nI've had a fetish for several years now (I won't be graphic about that, but I'll go into details if someone feels like it's relevant). It's not a terribly rare one, but not exactly vanilla either. I try to keep it to myself and don't really intend to act on it in any way. However, sometimes it's easy to forget that most people don't have it and I'm the weird one, resulting in me acting weird occasionally. One evening I got a bit depressed about things related to this and my girlfriend noticed it, and when she asked me about it I just said I didn't know how to explain it at the moment. (I hope this isn't too vague, as I said, I'll go into details if required.) She's probably expecting an explanation soon.\n\nThen, very recently, we were talking about things related to my fetish (I don't really know if I intentionally tried to make the conversation that way or if it just happened naturally), and she explicitly stated she doesn't understand it or people who like that kind of stuff. She made herself very clear.\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I have nothing to gain by telling her about my fetish, as it's evident that partaking in it would be unpleasant to her. She does seem like the type that would go out of her comfort zone and try things to make me happy but I really don't want that either.

The next day or two I started texting her, hoping to eventually ask her on a date, but after only a few texts the conversation died. I was way too nervous to talk to her again, and very shortly I felt like it was too late to talk to her much more. \n\nSo, we never really talked since then, and just recently I was standing on the corner near a bus stop, and she was across the street walking to get on the bus. (I was running a fundraiser and couldn't really step away). I noticed that she and her friend kept laughing and looking my way, and to be honest she seemed quite nervous about noticing me. I may be making false assumptions, but I take it to mean she does have an interest in me despite not having talked to me in almost 8+ months. \n\nI realize that she very possibly has a boyfriend by now, as I've facebook creeped on her just enough to see a picture of her standing next to a guy whom I can easily assume is her boyfriend.

Now this would be my first time moving out of my house (besides college which was 1 semester).  I have been excited and enthusiastic about this move.  Now the issue...\n\nHis brother, a year younger than him, is going through some issues with himself and wife, as of yesterday he might end up losing his job and face homelessness and divorce.  My SO was stressed out about this and came to the conclusion that he will stay on the couch of our home until he can put himself together.  I am for helping family, but honestly I am moving out of my mothers home for freedom, to not pick up after countless of people and to be able to come home, not feel pressure and relax.  I dont think it is suitable for a couple whom will be living together for the first time have to take on another person.  I know it takes about a year to adjust to a persons living habits and I dont want to ruin this special time for ourselves to take someone else in.  I wouldnt have an issue with it if him and I have been living together for sometime and his brother needing help after we had adjusted.\n\nI dont know how to approach this subject to him without seeming unsympathetic, or unreasonable.  I feel if I tell him, he will feel as if I am giving him an ultimatum, and added stress onto an already unfortunate situation.  Should I just let them two live together and wait until it is my time with him, or should we stick to our original plans to move in sans brother?\n\nI would appreciate any advice on how to bring this up please.\nTL;DR:"}

Since I was about 7, my mom has been on and off about letting me play M rated games. For about the past 4-5 years, I've been playing whatever I wanted. Now, at the start of November, she came into my room, out of nowhere, and told me that I will no longer be allowed to play M-rated/violent games, as long as I am in this house. She doesn't \"believe they're good for me.\" There's a few exceptions, such as Skyrim or Borderlands (I think?). I can't play Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Battlefield, etc. Now, this really bothers me because 1)A large chunk (160 on Steam) of my games are M-rated \"or violent\". 2)I essentially wasted LOTS of money by buying all the games I did, and I had preordered the new Call of Duty game the day before she made this idiotic rule. The only way I can play any of the games I want to play is to wait up early/stay up late, and play when they're asleep. I can't seem to convince her that, \"they're just video games, and they don't affect me.\" It may sound like a very small and stupid thing, but this is my hobby. I've spent money on it, put lots of time into competitive games so I could improve, and I've made lots of good friends. Any advice would be appreciated.   \n\nI can't seem to convince her, so maybe you can.\nTL;DR:"}

Something about the pot affected her and made her very paranoid. She thought the whole world was plotting to harm her or was making fun of her. This went on for 2-3 months when she finally gave up her job and went back to her parent's home. She spent a few months there and then met someone and got engaged. The engagement didn't last long enough because the guy was sort of immature. But after this, she got a new job and moved to a new city. I thought this was for the best and that she would have more control of her life now.\n\nBut I was wrong. She lives all alone in a studio. She doesn't even have internet connection and watches TV all day when she is not working. She is worried that her apartment is not safe. She's worried about wars, rapes and crimes outside her control. I think she is also lonely. But she still has trust issues and refuses to make new friends. She's trying to hold on to us - her old friends - but as much as we care for her, we are all caught up with our own problems.

We literally have arguments about it once every financial quarter because i get fed up. \n           \n             The first time we argued about it, i told her i felt lied to because before we moved in together we had sex all time to which she replied that she didnt lie we only hung out on the weekends so it only seemed like that. She goes to bed very early (8pm) every night (weekends included). Shes 32 year old. We argue a lot. Mostly because im angry at her due to the lack of sex. I suggested counseling and she refused, she saying that it would a waste of time because she thinks I wouldnt listen to a therapist. I suspect that she doesn't want to go because therapist will tell her things she doesn't want to hear about herself.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [27/F] don't like my husband's [30 M] dog\nPOST: First of all I am actually a dog lover but only like smarter breeds like golden retriever , german shepard. My husband has always liked bulldogs which honestly I find ugly, stupid and useless. When we were dating I didn't really see it as much of a problem because that dog is friendly and he's harmless and I do like typical dog behavior like begging for attention, licking me and following me around. \n\nNow we are living together and some of his behavior is starting to annoy me. First of all that dog is a huge 80lbs dog and I'm only 100lbs. Sometimes it jumps up to greet me and I find that annoying. My husband would always tell him off and ask him to stop and that stops it but it doesn't seem to have much of a long term memory and will do that again. Also that dog has always slept in bed and I find it hard to have good sleep with him in bed. I woke up more than 4times last night finding it sleep between me and my husband leaving me with no blanket. When it sleeps across the bed I couldn't stretch my legs, and it makes the bed way too warm and i prefer my bed cool when I sleep. Also that dog smells and slobbers and stuff dripping out of its eyes all the time and I find that gross. It also farts a lot and stinks up the whole room. I hate waking up in the middle of the room smelling bad dog farts. \n\nI addressed my concern with husband and he says he will not let dog in bed so that's good. But I feel like I just dislike bulldogs in general and I can't imagine having to live with that kind of fat lazy thing for the rest of my life. But my husband LOVES bulldogs, he got him after his first bulldog died and I guess he would want a new bulldog after this one dies. We are planning on having a baby next summer and I'm scared of the idea of getting pregnant while having this 80lbs dog jumping on me sometimes. He is my husband's baby tho and he said I'm the only thing in the world that he loves more than this dog. what should I do/say?\nTL;DR:"}

A couple days ago, right before our 5-month mark, we had a conversation about the pace of our relationship. We both think that, for dating for only 5 months, we've been going faster than other relationships. However, we both agreed that were comfortable with the way our relationship has been going. I'm a junior in college and she's a senior who graduates this spring. I feel like the reason that the past 5 months have been like they have been is because I wont see her on a daily basis next school year when she is working. Does the pace of a relationship really matter that much if both persons are comfortable with the current situation? I just want to hear outside opinions outside of our own on the situation.\n\nThanks guys/gals!\nTL;DR:"}

I went home for winter break (graduate student) and when I came back things did not feel the same but continued normally.\n \nA couple weeks ago I started a pretty big project and got very busy, I let her know I would be busy and working more and it would be easier if we didn't see each other every evening. By the time the project was over I realized my work was much better and more focused than usual. I also noticed that I was much more excited to see her after having a couple days to myself. She however was not very happy about those days. I came to the conclusion that between school and seeing her everyday I'm getting burnt out. We sat down and chatted about it (we agreed early on that our careers would always come first) and concluded that 3-4 times a week would be much better than every day.\n\nThat was fine and dandy but now that we are doing this she seems very very very bitter, and passive aggressive about not seeing each other every day. I tried talking to her about it again and it was the same conversation as last time she agreed and it went right back to the bitter / passive aggressiveness. \n\nIs there a better way to approach this? It's been about 3 weeks and she's normal in person but right back to passive aggressive if we don't see each other for a day.\nTL;DR:"}

I currently make $20/hr.  I believe I am underpaid at my job partly because I work in non-profit and partly because I feel my boss depends on me greatly but does not value the work I do.  After my second interview HR contacted me and asked me how much I make.  I was underprepared for this question and so I lied and said I made 22/hr.  I know it was really stupid and I should have just not disclosed my wage at all.  I wasn't thinking.  Now I am about to do my third interview and I am getting very nervous that they will find out.  I know that their HR already contacted one of my coworkers (given as a reference) and verified my coworker's facts with a manager's facts who I do not report directly to (also given as a reference).  I know this because they both told me what they had said after the references were given.  I am sure they are going to give me an offer contingent on speaking to my supervisor.  I am sure they will ask her to verify my wage.  I contacted our HR and their policy is to only provide basic information including salary but that my supervisor would be able to give more information.  Should I just withdraw my application now?

I got a job at MS a couple years back, and this incident happened just last week. \n\nSo I'm on the phone with this lady, let's call her Cathy. She calls tech support, and I get put on line to help her. She apparently can't turn on her computer, so I told her the power button was on the top-left corner of the PC. She told me again it wasn't working, so I told her that she needed to press it. She got mad at me for thinking she was dumb enough *not* to press the button, not that the computer wasn't working. So, I called in a friend/colleague (let's call him Albert) and we both got on the call. This is where I fucked up. I told him the story so far, but forgot to turn off my microphone. So when I told Albert the story, I may have exaggerated a bit. And then Albert called Cathy a bitch, which she apparently heard because after an inhuman squeal escaped the receiver, I figured that I forgot to press the mute button. And then she started bawling, saying that I would go to hell for calling her a bitch, even though I tried to explain that it was Albert. So, Albert now got me in trouble with my boss (let's call him Travis) after Cathy filed a complaint, and Travis now has me doing overtime to fix that mistake.\nTL;DR:"}

This week, I went with my parents and younger brother this time because I had a dentist appointment. Now, the dentist I used to have got in a little bit of trouble with the law (she's the one who took out all 4 of my wisdom teeth without anesthetics, see my post history) and \"retired\" back to China, we have a new dentist operating in the same facility now. Anyways, we drove there without incident and I started to get the general clean. It wasn't the actual doctor, but some assistant. She seemed new (intern, maybe?) and she was scraping my teeth with the slow precision of someone dismantling a bomb. She was leaning *so close* to my mouth, like, her nose was almost touching my front teeth (significant because Chinese noses). While she was scraping away, I just had a random thought... \"I wonder what would happen if I just headbutted her right now\". The look of unbroken concentration, the little wrinkle scar on her neck... I mean, she just looked... so headbuttable. \n  \nI didn't end up headbutting her, but the more I thought about it, the more amused I became. I started by smiling, then giggling, then by little laughs that sounded more like \"meeeeeeep\" because the assistant still had her hands (and nose) in my mouth. Soon, I was stifling violent spasms of laughter and the dentist chair was shaking because I was failing. The doctor herself came in to see what was wrong, and at that exact moment, I could no longer hold in my mirth. I started wailing with laughter, and everyone in the office and waiting room could hear it. They ended up cutting the appointment short because I couldn't compose myself enough to let them finish. I ended up laughing for around 10 minutes, and that was more than enough for everyone in the stiff Chinese dentist office to think I was crazy. They told my mom (who was waiting outside) that I was \"a very interesting daughter\"... I have to go back in two weeks to fill a cavity. Cringing in a corner now.\nTL;DR:"}

Every time a class missed a lesson (e.g. Communion or a day off) we would have the lesson we missed the next time we had a science lesson. For example, there's a chemistry lesson on Monday, but we have a day off, that lesson will be on the next science lesson we have.\n\nAnyway, the story: On the particular day of my fuck up, we had two science lessons, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, but we had a communion in the morning, so we had the mornings lesson in the afternoon, the day was fine, until after lunch. I had a music lesson, which ran through the first half of the science lesson, me being me, I had forgotten that the classes had been changed, so after the music lesson, I went to the class I thought I had. So I entered the classroom, and went to explain why I had been late to the class, I was so tired this day, that although I had recognized the people in the class (and most of them were laughing at how idiotic I was being), I'd completely blanked out the fact I was in the wrong class. After explaining why I was late, I proceeded to my desk, then the teacher says 'shouldn't you be in X teacher's class.' This is when the reality hit me that I was in the wrong class. I turned around and began my worst walk of shame to date, pretending to laugh to not show how stupid I was feeling, but I'm sure everybody knew how I was feeling anyway.\nTL;DR:"}

Sounded good to me. Problem is, she never paid it. I just applied for a credit card and got declined due to the debt being in collections. She never said anything to me about it and I never got any notices so I was unaware and if I had known I would have just paid for it myself. \n\nI called and confronted her about it and just got a lot of excuses and she said she would give me money to pay for it and that I can get it removed from my credit report. I got married recently and my husband and I decided not to take any help from her and just pay the debt on our own since she often uses things like that as guilt trips for favors. I paid it in full but there's no way for them to take it off the report since it was in collections for a year. Now my credit score is garbage and I have to wait 7 years for the judgement to come off. \n\nMy husband is understandably very upset and wants nothing to do with my mom. We are having a baby soon and it will be her first grandchild so obviously we can't ignore her, but I'm worried the tension will build and he will blow up on her about it especially since she spends so much money on stupid things. She also told me she never got any notices about the debt, but when I called they said they've been sending them for a year to her address. I haven't lived at home since I started school. So obviously she's blatantly lying as well. \n\nHonestly if we weren't having this baby I would probably just cut her off. I guess I need help navigating the future not only with the relationship I have with her but also her relationship with my husband. As of right now he can't stand her and wants absolutely nothing to do with her.\nTL;DR:"}

Technically me and her never 'defined our relationship', but the best way to explain it was that we were something between FWB and boyfriend / girlfriend. We were 'together' for 3 months. She was 22. \n\nThis wouldn't be a big deal, other than that she was my first sexual partner and also I really liked her. I'm pissed at myself for not defining what our relationship was (ie. whether we were dating or just hooking up). Things were going really well but then it came out of left field that she began seeing her ex-boyfriend, and it wasn't fair for her to see him while also seeing me. It sucks but because we never defined our relationship, I couldn't really get angry at her for seeing him. Me and her share a group of friends, which also sucks.  \n\nThis is likely the most generic breakup question ever, but how do you get over girls that you really like after dumped? My initial thought is to text this other chick that once made a move on me at a party ~1 month ago (we have a lot of common interests and I do think she would go out on a date with me, not just fantasizing). Not necessarily meaningless sex, but just move to another girl real fast to forget about this one that dumped me?\n\nI have a pretty stressful life with a 70 hr / week job and some other big shit happening and I typically bottle all of my emotions, and I'm afraid this is just another emotion hitting the bottle.\nTL;DR:"}

I think it's a strong relationship  and we are pretty sexually active.\n\nRecently she asked me to wear specific clothes before/during sex to create sort of a role playing situation. These include one specific outfit (think sweatshirt for a specific university), eyewear and hat. I asked her why she wanted this and she just said it was a fantasy for her. I thought this was kinda weird but I didn't want to shame her over it since I have requested some unusual stuff in the past. \n\nSo I am hunting down these required outfits for the last few weeks. I went over to my gf's family's house for new years and saw a picture on their wall of the family back when Emily was quite young. I should mention at this point that Emily's dad passed away from cancer when she was a teenager, so this picture must have been taken before that. It's was a vacation picture and in it her dad was wearing (almost) the exact outfit she requested for me to wear during sex. I didn't know what to do so I just kept my cool through the party. \n\nSince then I have been unable to get over this, which may reflect poorly on me but whatever. Although it is really gross for me to think that she is fantasizing about her dead dad I can't think of any other explanation for all of this behavior. At the same time, I don't want to outright accuse her of anything because it is a pretty serious issue if true and would be seriously awkward if not true. Like: \"Hey, are you getting off from memories of your dad?\" would be pretty offensive.\n\nShould I bring this up to her? Is there some explanation or information I am missing to make this make more sense? How should I proceed?\nTL;DR:"}

Everything between us is great; we love each other and have talked about marriage, kids, and the future.\n\nHer parents are that type of asian parents that want their child to be super successful (rich, doctor, lawyer) and marrying within the same ethnicity. I have a respectable job in the finance industry, but apparently it isn't successful enough for their soon to be doctor daughter. They've also been openly against the fact that I am not Chinese. I have been nothing but respectful of her, their culture, and her parents around them. Even so, they keep comparing me to her more successful Chinese classmates and have even urged her to date more suitable guys they've found.\n\nShe is conflicted because she is extremely loyal to her parents and has done everything they've ever wanted of her. For example, waiting until marriage for sex was one of her parents' rules and she had abided by it until me. But even after the fact, she was conflicted by this rule by keeping it a secret from them and so we have stopped recently so it wouldn't seem like a constant breaking of their wishes which caused her noticeable stress. She is so willing to please her parents that she is entertaining their idea to meet the other guys.\n\nShe has also been worrying about the future and I suspect it stems from her parental anxiety issues. She worries that if she takes time off work to be with our hypothetical kids, we would not be financially stable, even though there has never been a cause for doubt that I could not provide for her. She also worries that our love and happiness will fade after marriage. I constantly reassure her that I will do all I can to provide for and to love her and our potential family. I show my love at every chance I get. \n\nBut recently, her parents' lack of support and her never ending worries have gotten to both of us, stress for her, for me, it seems like a lost cause.

It made me so mad. I even said \"Okay, but I am not going to go down on your unless you stayed shaved too,\" and he just said okay like I wasn't going to go through with it.

She plays it off, we joke more, have more drinks, we continuously joke about hooking up.  She jokes about never being on the receiving end of \"let's be friends\" and admits she thinks I'm hot.\n\nShe invites me to her place to play guitar and hang.  We both keep admitting that we want to go at it, etc. but don't want to.  Real open talk, don't want to rush anything.  But then the next minute we're joking if we're gonna be friends, we'll have to make sure to stop ourselves if we happen to start hooking up.  Totally bipolar heavy flirting & friendzoning.  She then stands up and had her arms out, we had this weird extended embrace until a short kiss and I peaced.  She texts me like 5 minutes later and we text until we fall asleep.

Last year I was reffing a soccer game for the league I play at (paid $18 a game, wouldn't deal with this shit for free!) and some parents were really getting out of hand. They were yelling and protesting every call I made, when they CLEARLY were correct calls. I told the coach to control her parents or they would have to leave the field, and she did, then not even 5 minutes later, they started talking crap, AGAIN. I directly warned the parent this time, and he just laughed in my face (Keep in mind that I am a teenager so he apparently thought that he didn't need to respect me although I was referee).  At half time I called over a board member from the league, they told the coach that if there were any more problems I could end the game and cause them a forfeit.

He does help, but not that much. When he's at home he usually stays in front of the computer, but I think he could use an hour or two to help me. When I confront him it can goes two ways: he says I'm right and he'll do better or says that he hate that kind of talk.\n \n\nI know he's been trough a lot of stress and I gave him presents and I even bought him a nice wine to him relax, but I don't remember the last time he gave me a gift. He buys games (I don't mind if he plays, I play too) but usually complains if I ask him to use his credit card to buy something for the cats or for the house.\n\nHe's very affectionate, he loves to hug me, cuddle and say nice things but I don't think that enough. Am I crazy? Most of times when we talk about it it's pointless, I'm getting really tired of this routine. \n\nNow I'm starting to show how upset I am because I reached out a point I can't pretend to be ok.

She won't tell me who it was, because I \"shall be able to look him into the eyes when I meet him\" and he \"is a nice guy normally\". But she said he was a lot older than her.

She doesn't looked as much frightened on the new ones, and she still is going to diner with him once a while (I don't know what to think of that). \n\nShe is coming home tomorrow and I do want to confront her.

We later later decided it would be better to just stay friends, though I could sort of see that she still liked me in that way. I felt bad about this, but none the less I didn't feel the same way, so I just tried to be a good friend to her and put it behind us. Over the next few months it seemed pretty normal, much like how it was before we went on a date. Though occasionally, especially when drunk she would be very intimate but I would just ignore it because I assumed she just felt especially emotional when she was drunk. \n\nThen jump to a week ago, we were at a small party together and she  overheard me talking to a friend about a date I went on, at which point she stormed out the room. Later she asked if we could go on a walk together, so we did and mid conversation she stopped and said she is in love with me. \n\nI didn't know how to react so I said we'd talk about it another time, we hugged and then went back and pretended it didn't happen. I would assume she said it because she was drunk, but the next day we talked about it on the phone and she said she has been in love with me for a long time now. \n\nI'm not really sure what to do about this situation, I don't feel the same way and it sort of scared me a bit. I know we are only 18 and we're at an emotional age etc. But she seems very sincere about this.\nTL;DR:"}

And it will randomly go out a lot. I live in my friend's house. I pay him monthly by paypal, and he pays everything by automatic payments from his bank account. But that means I can't call and bitch at Comcast because it's not my account. And it can be pretty difficult to get ahold of my friend sometimes (he lives across the country)\n\nI asked him tonight to change the account to me, so that's an option, so I could call Comcast and complain or at least tell them and see if it is normal.\n\nAlso, I could get him to cancel the internet and get my own internet, but I know nothing about that... there is a router and wifi thing hooked up in the house. But the cable is automatically Comcast by housing rules, and the internet hookup is also Comcast by convenience.\n\nThe main problem is is that I have many classes online and if the internet goes out during an exam, it is explicitly clear that it is not an excuse and I will fail the class (because I could go to the crappy college where no computers are ever available and do it there and supposedly have good internet there)... And if I fail 1 class during an online exam I will fail my entire degree... for age-restriction reasons, I have to graduate by a certain time or I will not get the job. \n\nSo what do I do to have reliable internet? It's like 1-5 times a month, that it happens, more so recently. And it magically recovers like 1-8 hours later. And it's not my laptop, I have tried with multiple devices. I'm pretty sure it is the internet service provider. Or maybe a bad router? But my guess is no.\n\nEvery time the problem comes up as \"The DNS server is not responding\"... but after trying everything I'm pretty sure it is Comcast, because nothing ever works, and eventually it just starts working again like normal after many hours.\nTL;DR:"}

I bended over and tried fixing them, but then I realized that I had boobs and a pretty low cut, so I sprung up immediately to check if nobody saw me.

Things have been going great, and we haven't hit a single bump. We are now a couple of months in, but something has been bothering me recently. She always aims to please me. An example of this would be something like whenever I asked what she wanted to do on date night, she'd always say whatever I wanted. Now I don't want to come off as over dramatic, but recently I've realized that she straight up won't tell me her person feelings on stuff at all. A couple weeks ago, she got a little too drunk, and threw up on me and herself. I took care of her, got her cleaned up, carried her home and in bed, and eventually found my way home on my own. Let me make it clear that I'm totally okay with what happened, and It doesn't bother me at all. I literally haven't even thought about it much since then, but ever since it seams that she tries too hard to please me. We had sex recently, and I can't really tell how she feels about it at all, she didn't want me to give her oral or anything. I'll admit I get horny, but I don't want her to think she has to do anything for me that she doesn't want to do. Now I'm really uncomfortable flirting with her, because I really can't tell how she feels about anything. Every time I ask her about stuff like this, she won't really tell me how she feels, and every time I suggest something to do, she gives me the same compliant answer regardless of what it is. What should I do? All I want is for her to be happy.\n\nSorry for any spelling, formatting or grammar mistakes, mobile is kinda weird.\nTL;DR:"}

The doctor also thinks that he might be better with a psychiatrist instead of a psychologist.  \n  \n\nIn the mean time, he's been suspended from aftercare 5 times this school year and has been to the principal's office twice. His behavior at home isn't fabulous, but is not nearly as violent as it is at aftercare. He has temper tantrums at home, but there, he throws himself violently against walls, hits his head against the wall, and today, tried to choke himself with his hands... after screaming that he hates everything.  \n  \n\nHe's very bright but doesn't seem to be able to remember the things we talk about when we or his therapist discuss his behavior (even THAT morning).

The other group did not exercise.\n\n> Meanwhile, the men in both groups were told to generally stop moving so much, decreasing the number of steps that they took each day from more than 10,000 on average to fewer than 4,000, as gauged by pedometers. The exercising group's treadmill workouts were not included in their step counts. Except when they were running, they were as inactive as the other group.\n\n> Both groups also were directed to start substantially overeating. The group that was not exercising increased their daily caloric intake by 50 percent, compared with what it had been before, while the exercising group consumed almost 75 percent more calories than previously, with the additional 25 percent replacing the energy burned during training.\n\n> Over all, the two groups' net daily energy surplus was the same.\n\n> The experiment continued for seven days. Then both groups returned to the lab for additional testing, including new insulin measurements and another biopsy of fat tissue.\n\n> The results were striking. After only a week, the young men who had not exercised displayed a significant and unhealthy decline in their blood sugar control, and, equally worrying, their biopsied fat cells seemed to have developed a malicious streak. Those cells, examined using sophisticated genetic testing techniques, were now overexpressing various genes that may contribute to unhealthy metabolic changes and underexpressing other genes potentially important for a well-functioning metabolism.\n\n> But the volunteers who had exercised once a day, despite comparable energy surpluses, were not similarly afflicted. Their blood sugar control remained robust, and their fat cells exhibited far fewer of the potentially undesirable alterations in gene expression than among the sedentary men.\nTL;DR:"}

I know that neither of us can afford fancy dates at five star restaurants or a movie night every week and I am okay with that.

He takes her out to see plays, try new food, or to other events in the city (like the carnival in the summer, which I had suggested to my boyfriend as a date, but ended up going with a girl friend because he didn't want to go). It made me think about my own relationship and how less exciting it seemed. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still love my boyfriend very much, which is why I want to find some middle ground with dates where we are both happy and can focus on each other instead of the event at hand.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by putting my arm around a girl\nPOST: This happened about 2 months ago, with a girl that goes to my high school. A little background on me is that I'm not someone who is known to always get the ladies, or usually have that much success with them. However in this case this girl and I really clicked, conversation was easy and overall I really liked this girl. We had been talking in school and texting for about a month, so I finally asked her out on a date and it was going really well. I picked her up and we went to Panera, had some lunch (which I payed for), and figured that we would end the night with seeing a movie. We arrive at the theater and all is going well, I am not too forward and I surely don't do anything that would pressure her or make her feel uncomfortable, as we don't see each other a ton face to face. About halfway through the movie I put my arm around her and begin to lightly caress her arm. **This would prove to be demise of my relationship with this girl.** Then probably 10 minutes after my unspeakable action, she went to the bathroom to bawl her eyes out. (which I was unaware of at the time) Upon her return she was unusually distant from me, and remained that way until the end of the movie. She then informed me that her mother would be picking her up so I wouldn't have to bring her home. Nothing weird about that right? **WRONG** I was rather perplexed by how the date ended, but it didn't seem to be anything to worry about. I then asked a female friend of mine, who was also friends with my acquaintance, to see if she knew anything. Apparently when I put my arm around her it reminded her of a similar action that a previous boyfriend of hers did, so this was the reason for her reaction. I tried for a few weeks to ask her what the problem was, in school and through text, but she made it a point to ignore and avoid both. So my simple action that reminded her of a past romance completely eradicated any hope for a relationship for us. So tifu by actually giving a fuck and trying to have a relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

The first point is that even though the moves are planned and choreographed, there's no real way to \"fake\" jumping off a twenty foot ledge or flying through a table. That shit happens. Of course, because it's planned it doesn't hurt as much, but it's not like they're using CGI when someone jumps off a tall ledge and falls through a table. \n\nThe second, more important, point is that it doesn't matter that wrestling is fake. Everyone loves to ridicule fans of pro wrestling as if they're complete retards. Do you honestly believe that there are people out there who think wrestling is real? Of course not. It's a work of fiction. \n\nWhat if I said, \"What are you some kind of retard? You know that Arrested Development is not real, right? Those guys are actors, they're on a sound stage reading scripts.\" You'd think I was a moron. Well, the same can be said of pro wrestling. It's a fictional show.

Generally, I would manage to gather $3-$5 cash if I needed it, and back then (early 90's) that could get me by for a couple of days.  Purchasing gasoline with cash and only a limited amount (i.e. not a fill-up) always involved paying the cashier first so that the pump would stop at the amount paid.\n\nSo, one day, I was in a big hurry to get to a soccer tournament and my car ran out of gas about 100 yards from the gas station with $3.25 in my pocket.  Undaunted, I emptied the 1 gallon water jug I had in the back floorboard for when the car would overheat, trekked the 100 yards to the store, and bought $0.25 in gas (roughly 1/4 gallon), pumped it into the milk jug, walked back to the car, then fueled the car enough to drive to the gas pump.  This worked out fine.\n\nOnce I'd gotten the car to the the pump, I went into the store a second time, paid for $3 in gas, walked back to the car, got in and drove off.\n\nAbout 5 miles on my way, the car acted like it was running out of gas *again* then died.  Having run out of gas twice, at first I was sure I had a gas leak.  After all, I had *just bought* $3 worth.\n\nI was about half way through with my walk back home that I entertained the possibility that I had driven off without pumping the gas.

The judge ruled that she was wrong and said she had to remove the garment. Then I discovered she had a conviction for child abuse. (I knew she was a convicted felon, just never knew what for) I could never had predicted that the woman I was gaming with for over a year was a child beater and all-around psycho bitch.\nTL;DR:"}

I can't do long-distance..\nPOST: I met this girl on tinder a few weeks ago, we are both at university together, her in her third and final year, me in my first. We do get along well, she is really into me, and I am really attracted to her.  \n\nHowever I can't help but notice some red flags and think about the future even if it is all hypothetical. Her course means she will finish university in March next year, I wont be finished with my year until the end of May. When she finishes she will definitely be moving home which is about 3 hours away (a long way for people living in the UK compared to the US) and I don't know if I could handle a long distance for 2 years while she will be working full time. I cant imagine how much time we will have for each other with my studies, her work and the travelling time between us. I got back with my ex (who i broke up with before starting uni last year when i was doing a different course, which is why I am a first year again) last christmas at home and by the time we both got back to uni, even though she was only an hour away, I didn't feel like it was working because it seemed like such we were both dragging each other away from our lives rather than sharing it.  \n\nAt the moment both our lives are busy too, she is usually away Thursday night to Sunday night at home because she has a job, and I have other commitments to field hockey which takes up my entire Wednesday as well as training on Monday evenings. I am just not sure I should be starting something now, if I even want to, as well as worrying if it'll be worth starting something if it will inevitably end in the future.  \n\nAny advice appreciated, or ask me for any other info.\nTL;DR:"}

Had a word with both K and M and they are completely happy and okay with it. I love the situation but M and I have been sexting for a few days now which is somehow also okay with K.

Blew yellow on the Breathalyzer and failed roadside tests. However, he burped 3 times while he was in the car, which according to the cop requires them to retrieve a blood sample. My friend told me his blood looked odd and \"chunky\" when it was being pulled. They set a court date for April 1st, 2013. He received a phone call about a week after the incident telling him his court date was postponed until further notice. He was told that he will receive mail informing him of the new date, but was instructed to call the police once a week to check for a new date. As of today, (May 17th, 2013) a new date has not been set.\n\nI understand that the right to a speedy trial does not always apply if one of the parties needs the extra time for certain circumstances. We speculate that the delay is due to inconclusive blood tests.\n\nMy question is, how long do they have to set a trial date in this case?

I was fine for probably 4-5 months but recently I can't stop thinking about the woman. I have tried everything to push out these depressing thoughts, exercise, eating better, going out, xanax, but nothing is working. Just a couple of hours ago I had to leave class to go for a run because I couldn't stand what I was feeling.\n\n I think the root of the problem is that I am emotionally lonely. I moved two states away from my family to attend College. While I have an amazing group of friends, they are the guys and we don't talk about emotions, and frankly I wouldn't want to talk about it with them. I'm pretty antisocial and have fairly low confidence when it comes to women, so I don't have a close friend who is a girl that I would feel comfortable talking with. This also means that I haven't met a romantic prospect. I'm not saying I want to get a new woman, however I just need someone who I can connect with on an emotional level. \n\nAnyway sorry for the rant, I wanted to ask you all how you coped with your feelings after a breakup? Anything would help as my work and school is falling behind due to me longingly looking out the window all day. Just kidding, but really it has been mentally crippling.\nTL;DR:"}

We never really stopped talking, one of us would cave in after a few days when we did try. Her friend recently spoke to me and said my ex was very interested in giving it another shot (quoting her, 'I just want X'), but was scared. I confronted her about it, asked what she wanted, but she never really gave me a proper answer because she claims she doesn't know what she wants. I suggested that we meet for coffee and see how things were and if we could make it work again.\nThis is when it gets frustrating. Her friend, we'll call her E, always had a problem with me for no apparent reason - she was from a village outside the city I live in and so I'd never had any interaction with her or any of her friends prior to meeting my ex. Turns out, they were having an argument about it and apparently I am manipulative (which was news to both of us). E said that if my ex even met up with me she would completely cut her off. So basically she had an ultimatum, it would either be her best friend or me... She did eventually agree to meet up with me for coffee (which we will be doing soon) but even if it goes great, will her 'best friend' not just guilt trip her out of it? \n\nHow am I meant to get anywhere with this girl, if E will always hold us back and make things difficult? I know it seems very childish, it even seems very childish to me - but I am very much in love with this girl, she was my first proper girlfriend and I want to show my ex how terrible her friend is being, but just don't know quite how to deal with it.\nTL;DR:"}

He is amazing, very sweet, we've been together for almost a year now and we have been living together for a couple months. I am happier than I have ever been.\n\nHowever, every single time he goes out with his friends, or even mentions a female coworker in conversation, my stomach burns with jealously and my mind races thinking of all the ways he could be cheating on me. Let me be clear that he has never thrown off any red flags to indicate that he may actually be cheating. I KNOW that I am being irrational and so I try very hard not to act on these feelings or give any indication that I don't trust him. I tell him to have fun with his friends and try to deal with these feelings on my own.\n\nBut the problem is that I don't trust him. I have never ever been able to find trust in any relationship I have ever been in. In my last relationship, I was that girlfriend texting 1000 times and having a meltdown every time my boyfriend went out with his friends. The result was that all his friends thought I was crazy (which is probably pretty accurate) and eventually x-boyfriend stopped going out until we spent ALL of our time together and suffocated our relationship. \n\nLooking back I can see how my insecurities ruined that relationship and I don't want to make the same mistake twice. I don't want to be that crazy needy girlfriend ever again. \n\nHow? How do I learn to trust another person with my feelings and just have faith they won't trample all over my heart? I don't have any close friends, I have literally never fully trusted anyone in my life other than my mom who passed away two years ago. I feel completely alone. I don't want to be this jealous insecure person anymore. I want to know what it feels like to fully let someone in. But I don't even know how to go about tearing these walls down.\nTL;DR:"}

Started going to college on the 20th at a really nice school. I'm in the military so I should be getting tuition assistance. Only thing is, it turns out that when you are starting class in the military, you have to first fill out a forum asking for permission to begin a degree program, THEN fill out a different forum right before class starts to get approved for tuition assistance. I figured they were both part of the first process and didn't look into it further until my school asked for the tuition assistance letter. Went to get it and it informed me that I needed to start the tuition assistance paperwork prior to starting the class. The school I'm going to has a scholarship that would have covered most of the remaining cost, but it requires me to have tuition assistance. Now instead of paying around $250 for fees and books, it's around $3000, due in full around October. Guess that'll be a good time to make my most expensive credit card purchase yet!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm clever and I know a lot because I loved to read and learn since I was very young, due to this I coasted comfortably through all of school without studying, sometimes completely neglecting assignments, and I never got a job even though all of my friends did at 14. I should also add in that I wish to go to law school after getting a bachelors degree in *something*.\n\nMy marks are *fine*, fine being the keyword. I've never failed a class but I only ever received honor roll once (Honor roll being an average of over 85 in all classes) and nowadays my marks sit at 67% average with my best class being a 75% and my worst being a 58%. I don't expect to be the valedictorian but I would love to have a high (85%-95%) for the next year and a half. The saying \"a lot of people want a lot of things\" definitely applies here, but I know for a fact I could do it if I could learn to study and do homework regularly, as I'm sure you know bad habits are an uphill battle.\n\nMy second issue is I have no real experience in a workplace, as I already said I have never had a job and I would but I use a constant excuse, that being where I live. See I live in a small town of about 5,000 people that's around half an hour from my High School (which is situated in a city with 140,000 people), I don't have a drivers license and I wont be able to get one until May of this year so working in the city is nearly impossible.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by not paying attention during the SAT\nPOST: It was so ridiculous that I still don't quite know what to think about it. I was taking the SAT, doing well, confident in the essay that I wrote, yada yada. Well, we went out for break and per the proctors instruction, I slipped my answer packet into the test booklet. I slipped it in to section 3 because, well, that was the next section and I was just kind of on autopilot because I was stressed about doing my best. \n\nWe get back from break and the proctor instructs us to open up our answer packets and, if you haven't taken the SAT, there's a part where you need to write in script about how 'this is your work and no one elses'. So, I flip open to the answer packet and I'm doing my best to remember how to do cursive. As I'm writing, the proctor says in a stern voice \"EXCUSE ME, is your test book open?\" I realize she's talking to me. I apologize profusely, trying to explain myself, but she's having none of it. I close the test booklet and tell myself to get my act together and pay attention. \n\nI was shaking from her yelling out to me. I simply was under so much stress that I was having a hard time processing it. Trying to calm myself down and finish with the cursive, I heard the proctor say 'section 3'. I assumed we were starting section 3, so in my autopilot mode I flip it open again. The proctor lost it, wondering 'how stupid' I could be. I was honestly wondering the same thing, too. There was another kid who didn't understand as well, and she both reported us to her supervisor. The supervisor informed us that our scores would most likely be canceled because we could've been cheating. \n\nI finished section 3, excused myself, and canceled my scores. I signed myself up for the December one, but if I mess up on that one then I can't go to college. So basically because I was so nervous, stressed out, and auto pilot about doing well, I did the exact opposite.\nTL;DR:"}

I also lose any motivation to work or take care of myself and develop sleep-pattern disruptions.\n\nAnything can set off the episodes. Tonight, I lost a chess match to a novice, which set off a pattern of thinking about how much of a loser i am, in so many aspects of my life, and especially social ones. I try to rationalize myself out of these kinds of thoughts, but I usually can't.\n\nI've talked to a psychologist since I was a young child, when my parents divorced. He and I agree that my depression doesn't warrant medication, with all its side effects.

After 3 years of frustrating myself under the impression that I had the passion for visual art I quit school and decided to move on, inspired by a then-freshly developing relationship with a young lady.  I had a few friends at school but lost touch with them as they either left the city or our common interest dissolved.  Since then I had taken up a 9-5 and spent my time devoted to writing music/selling records/mp3s and the aforementioned young lady.  At the time I was feeling pretty satisfied and didn't really see a need to socialize outside of that. It was a pretty intimate relationship that I took seriously and to this day I'm lost to understand how things went so awry.  After about a year she decided our romantic interests no longer met and that we should just be friends, a strategy that has not been copacetic.\n\nDismantled, I struggled to focus my energy on my hobby with some success.  I did an album, I toured internationally, I rubbed shoulders with some pretty high level people in that scene. Made a few friends but they live far away and are quite busy themselves.  Music industries are exploitative, oversaturated, and ruthlessly commercial and that has left me with some doubt about continuing.  Over the course of the last two years my inspiration has waned and now I'm left feeling pretty dead and empty now that I no longer have that hobby to distract me.\n\nI've not had much chance to make friends or meet people I connect with over that time, and every friend I've had made has grown apart from me.  I go out semi regularly and socialize but rarely connect with anyone, so far never enough to sustain a friendship or romance. I feel somewhat crippled by the vaccumn of intimacy and social support left by the end of my last serious relationship. After all this time I'm only barely aware of my own personal identity in a social context to even know where to go to meet people with things in common - Reddit included. I'm introverted but not anti-social, and right now I'm at the nadir of a two year rut, and feeling especially lost\nTL;DR:"}

Do a bit of weights and then hit the elliptical glider machine thing for about 20 to 30 min (about 1.5 miles). Not really sure what to do at the gym, but I sweat, so I must be doing something right. \n\nAnyways, the issue I have is the eating part. I have horrible self-control when it comes to food. I work graveyard at a hospital as IT, and it is very slow and I get very bored. When I get bored, I want to eat, don't know why, but I just think about eating. Then if I do eat, I usually eat dumb food, and then I'm depressed and mad at myself for eating it. Also, pizza and burgers are my kryptonite, and I get the same feeling everytime I eat it. You'd think if it makes me feel depressed, mad at myself, as well as makes me feel like garbage, why would I eat it. Well I don't know. That's why I'm here, to ask, what do you do when you crave non-healthy food? Also, what do you do to keep the self discipline to stay on a healthy diet?\nTL;DR:"}

I have one year left of school then we'll probably jump to >~$200k combined.\n\nWe have basically no savings aside from her 403b which she maxes monthly.

We're definitely going to build up savings from her income this year but nothing substantial.\n\nFor the next year I'd like to help build up her credit score, mine is currently in excess of 700, while at the same time getting a good card. I thought Amazon because we 1) spend a lot on gifts at Christmas 2) I have Prime with free shipping 3) We can get a lot more use of out Amazon with extra incentive to buy household items, things we'd get at Target or other department stores.\n\nThe Amazon card is 3% cash back on Amazon purchases, 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and drugstores (not sure if this is only Rx or just like anything at CVS), and 1% back on all other purchases with no annual limit. \n\nThe thought is that we'd make enough to subsidize our Christmas spending largely with points at the end of the year. \n\nPersonally I've never carried CC debt unless it was to finance a 0% interest item (laptop once, currently engagement ring). I put everything monthly on my Southwest card then pay it off each month. I'm think about getting the Amazon card for both of us to share, then using it for all shared expenses (eating out, gas, households, on trips, etc.) and continuing to pay it each month.\n\nAny thoughts on if this seems like a sound plan for the next year?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: How do we mobilize the poor?\nPOST: I recently read a quote that said something along the lines of \"When the poor fight back, God doesn't care\".  Effectively, when the folks who are most suppressed finally reach their limits and revolt, they have the moral authority to do so.  Nobody steps in when a bullied kid fights back in school, people don't typically stand up for assholes who get called on their shit, so why should this be any different?  My question, as the title states, is how do we go about mobilizing the poor?\n\nIt seems to me that this would be a good first step in tackling the current class crisis going on worldwide because trying to mobilize the middle class is near impossible, as we're a) Too preoccupied by the lower class and b) too scared to face the harshness of the realities that our society can create, so we just keep on doing as we're told and keeping our heads in the sand because we've got \"too much to lose\".  \n\nMy suggestion would be world/nationwide talks in our communities directed solely to low income families/individuals.  Educate them on how their class was essentially created by the rich to distract the middle class.  Then ask them if they feel insulted by this.  Then start to do the same for the middle class, where those with a conscience/straight moral compass could at least begin to feel compelled to do something.\nTL;DR:"}

I gave him presents at Christmas, but pretty much gave up and didn't get him anything for our anniversary.\n\nWith Valentine 's Day coming up tomorrow, I know that he has made no plans to do anything.

Even though our relationship isn't built on things like presents, I feel neglected. I don't want to seem ungrateful for everything that he has done for me and given to me over the years. Our relationship isn't flawless (I know that no one's is), but it has been worse since it has become long distance. He is still the one that I want to be with forever and marry, but I don't know how to get past this. Should I try to bring it up again? If so, how?

I used to smoke weed before I met her (quite often) but I quit when I met her cause I didn't want her to get into the habit. Up until recently I went about 6 months without smoking... the past weekend wsa the first time I smoked in 6 months (friends 18th birthday party). I was given some free weed and because I have sleeping problems I smoked it before I go to sleep (I used to do it before I met my girlfriend)...\n\nHowever I started realizing over the past few days that my girlfriend and I have started texting a lot less ( we barely see eachother during the week because of school). Things seem different then they were a week ago, but I don't feel like anything significant has happened (other then a minor fight)...

We've been dating for 2.5 years, and both of our personal firsts in terms of a long-term relationship. Both of us are employed, making about $24,000 a year, but like most people, have student loans and credit card debt up the wazoo. I can say this year of living outside the home has been a fun, but loaded with financial struggle. Now the lease signing is coming up, and she wants to stay another year, but I want to move out to go back home (which is close to where I work) in order to save money/clear some debt and spend one more summer with my whole family before everyone moves away (siblings going off to college in different parts of the region). Additionally, our living arrangement is not what I expected, specifically the cleanliness of the apartment, the unevenness of the chores, with me doing the most. If I ever suggest that she does chores or ask her to help, she seems very inconvenienced. We've tried working on it but little changes after each talk/argument.\n\nI've brought up that I have been thinking about moving back home, but that quickly turned into an argument from her side. If I were to move out, she says that she would have to move back home, which is in a different state, because she could not support herself on her income alone. All her friends are either staying in their apartments with no available rooms or moving across the country, and she absolutely does not want to look for roommates on Craigslist. \n\nI feel very guilty. I don't want to destroy her life by causing her to move back home and effectively making her unemployed because she would have to find work elsewhere. But I can't help the thought that I am not in a good place in my life living with my SO. How can I explain to her that I think I just need to go and that I don't wish to struggle as much as I am right now? How do I avoid destroying her life? \n\nThank you very much in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

They were single, she wasn't. She's generally a very open person about everything, we don't really hold back on our pasts.\n\nWe had been literally dating for maybe 3-6 days. She admitted it to me, out of nowhere (from what I can remember of the conversation we had). I take that as a sign of trust that she'd even want to tell me that. She could have kept it a secret. Her friends were obviously sleeping around most nights because it's Vegas and they're single. I guess she didn't want to be boring.\n\nShe thinks it's not that bad given the circumstances (just making out, vacation, just started dating). My response wasn't anger, it was basically \"I figured you did something but I was just waiting for you to admit it\" and I didn't get angry, partly because getting angry would likely stop her from honesty coming clean again.\n\nAs for her friend(s) that she went with, I never really knew them well because a little while after coming back, she was falling for me and spending a lot of time with me, they got jealous and got into drugs and they really haven't talked much sense. They were kind of a bad influence and never liked me so I can picture them persuading her to let loose and have fun.\n\nWhat would you think of this?

My mom won't take his truck away because they live 45 minutes away from the school and she can't/won't drive him.\n\nHe consistently fails at least one class each 6 weeks, with comments from his teachers like \"lack of interest/effort.\" I was very self-motivated, and my mom doesn't know how to handle this situation. She did absolutely nothing to get him on track in his early years of high school, yet she's confused about why he's messing up so badly. Her previous attempts (basically just screaming and calling him a loser who's not going to graduate) failed miserably.\n\nI overheard him the other day talking to his friends about smoking weed. I think he's skipping class to go smoke with his friends. I don't think smoking is something horrible, but the issue is that he's skipping/failing and generally being an irresponsible teenager. I really don't think it's a good idea to tell my mom about his decision to smoke, because she won't handle it well.\n\nI'm very concerned about him. I don't think it's too late to turn things around, but he's difficult to approach. He has that typical teenage boy \"I'm always right and I know everything\" mentality.

Shortly after visiting him I decided I was going to finally move to NYC. This isn't about him AT ALL. I've been talking about doing this for a while, before I met him even. I have no connections to my current city other than I went to school here. I have family & friends in NY and its just where I want to be. \n\nI wanted to make this move since before I met him. I was on the fence since I hadn't been to the city in a while and it was kind of a faraway dream. When I went to the city to visit him something awoke in me. I needed to move here. It was my dream and I didn't want to let my life pass me by. I buckled down and got a job in the city.\n\nAnyways, as my move gets closer I feel him pulling back. I really think he thinks that this move has something to do with him and I'm scaring him off. Its the opposite actually. I want to move and create my own circle of friends/date people/find independence.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Boyfriend[26M] giving me [26F] very mixed messages.\nPOST: I've been with my boyfriend for approximately 4 years now, and we keep having the same issue over and over. After going on birth control pills my sex drive dropped to almost non existance - which I understand is hard for the other partner. However I've fixed that and gotten it under control. The problem is that during the time of no sex drive, my boyfriend would get very angry with me. He demanded that I not fake any sort of passion or orgasm, but also would get very angry that I wasn't passionate enough. He would get sulky and frustrated and be nasty for days, saying he didn't want me to consent to sex if I wasn't going to be into it. Then he would get nasty because we hadn't done it in a while, so I would then do it even when I really didn't want to just to make him happy. He would then be satisfied for a while before again he would say i wasn't passionate enough and then get angry and close off again. This happened repeatedly for a while, and now I'm to the point where I'm never wanting sex because to me it's not intimate anymore, no matter what I do it's not good enough, and I'm just a sex toy to him. The problem is that he's getting back into his \"you aren't passionate enough\" phase after guilting me into sex twice a day for the past week. He knows how I feel, but he turns any time I try to talk about it back on me, making me feel bad for not being passionate enough and feel bad for not giving him enough sex even though I really don't want it. I recently read an article about coerced consent and figure it's pretty much me. I don't know what to do about it all.\nTL;DR:"}

We always talked about having kids, sort of in a 'down the road' kind of way, but now it seems like we're there, and in the last little while I've found myself kind of panicked; I'm finding our nieces/nephews more irritating to be around, and I just do not feel the desire to start a family that I expected to by this point in my life. At the same time, I know the window won't be open forever, and that it's the \"expected\" thing. \n\nI've told my wife we should start trying, but she doesn't want to do that if I'm not excited about it. She is worried that if we have kids when I'm not into it I'll end up resenting her, but I'm worried that if we don't she'll resent me.\n\nI don't know how to handle things going forward; it seems like this decision is hanging over us now, and started to impact our sex life, among other things.\nTL;DR:"}

It's gone from being strictly friendly texting ever other day or so to being text exchange throughout the day and as well as phone conversation, there's suddenly appeared quite a sexual tone in amongst the normal stuff from both of us. He calls me everyday. I spoke to him last night and told him I didn't want him basically not to lead me on if it doesn't mean anything. He told me that he wasn't.\n\nProblem is due to life circumstance, he lives 4 hours away in the next state. So I haven't seen him face to face for years (we've met several times before) and I'm not likely to in the near future. He offered to come and see me, but my schedule conflicted and I couldn't do it.\n\nSo I thought that perhaps he's interested in more than a friend, but then he casually mentions a girl he met on a night out that he thought was hot.

While doing all this I drank, smoked had girlfriends and ate whatever I wanted, halal or non-halal I did not give a flying shit. I still don't. I am married now with 2 kids and a wife, and I am 29 years old. I am not much of a practicing Muslim anymore, I lean more towards being an Agnostic but I still like to adhere to the cultural standards Islam has brought. Now my wife is moderate too, she doesn't wear a head cover, loves movies and dresses however she wants, which is a good thing, that is why I married her. Alright my main point here is I am so fucking pissed. All this Islam terrorist crap is fucking up everything! Besides the evil it is doing in the World, American Muslims are feeling the effects here. Now I may not be a full believer anymore but my kids are and my wife is, I will eventually let my kids decide what they want to do with their lives, but for now I believe it is no harm to bring them up as my wife is not really strict at all or super religious. Man, I just want to be able to play video games, celebrate Christmas with my best friends, grow old in a nice house with two dogs. Why should I be worried then? Well my family, my mom, dad and relatives are all still Muslim. That means that all this Islamophobia, if it gets worse will affect them, and shit that really sucks. No one wants to see their family go through craziness like that, especially when they are just normal Americans that work and come home and watch TV. I also don't want my kids to go threw that shit, and it really fucking sucks that I have to worry about something like that, when their are so many bigger problems in life.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/books\nTITLE: \"Shadows In Flight\" - Discussion on the Enderverse (spoilers all books)\nPOST: **Preamble:** All the time here I see people asking about Ender's Game and the sequels. Usually around if they should be read and which people like and dislike. But it is usually because someone who hasn't read any ask, thus there is very little discussion on the actual content of the books. I'm hoping for something different here.\n\n**Warning:** Discussion here will likely (hopefully?) include details from all four Ender books and all five Bean books. If you haven't read all the books then maybe avoid here.\n\n(admittedly I've read everything except *Ender in Exile* but I'm willing to take a risk with that one book, as it isn't part of the \"core\" books)\n\n**And now onto my actual comment/post:**\n\nI have just finished *Shadows In Flight* and was wondering what others thought of it. Specifically around the Formics and how it completely changes our understanding of their thoughts and their society. This book has huge impact on the end of *EG* and *CotM*, because the interactions with the Formics is based on the idea that the Queen has been truthful, that she was the last Queen and that the Formic workers etc. couldn't think for themselves. To me it completely changes Ender's interactions and his actions. It reduces his ability to 'read and understand people' if he has lived with the Queen for so long but doesn't understand her. Also, if the male Formics could overpower Bean's kid's minds so strongly, has the Queen done that to Ender at least a bit?\n\nI liked the book. It was a good story and it was interesting to get some much detail on the Formics and their ships - it was something severely lacking in the previous books - and it was a nice send-off for Bean. But in the end, it just doesn't sit right with me.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [27/M] Have successfully predicted 4 out of 5 breakups [M/F pairs between 19-24] - what to do?\nPOST: Hello there! Throwaway for not exposing - even accidentally - any of the people involved.\n\nAlmost two years ago, I've asked about a relationship advice on this subreddit about a girl who was (and still is) in a relationship with an acquaintance and the general consensus here was that I (and anyone actually) won't be able to talk sense into a dysfunctional relationship and it's better to let it figure out themselves. Some commentators also insulted me for getting involved.\n\nBut it gets on: after that, there have been 4 other examples (so now 5 total), where I successfully predicted that the people involved are going to split, because they're simply too incompatible. And the one relationship that still sticks together is probably going to fail sometime in the future - when the two people involved will have more time to themselves and realize that (they only see each other on the week-end, while the guy sees another girl on a daily basis).\n\nAnd now onto my problem. Two of these girls (out of 5), were actually really interested in me and I in them. But since I always listened to the advice to simply GTFO out of their life, what happened is that after one of them quit her relationship by finding another guy - one who wasn't so keen on simply letting others be (as I was). And I'm here thinking - \"Why not me? Why did I listen and step aside?\"\n\nOn the other hand, I had to go through some really big drama, because of the other males involved and the inability of said girls to hold their ground. \n\nAs it currently stands, I'm desperate. I'm trying to avoid getting to know any girls who are in any relationships, because if I find out the incompatibility of a pair, nobody's going to listen to me anyway and even hate me for trying to help them.\n\nSo, what would you do if you knew two people are incompatible to be together? How to tackle such a situation in order to prevent anger and drama?\n\nThanks for reading!\nTL;DR:"}

He creates problems where they don't exist, overreacts to small things, picks everything apart until he creates a problem or blows it out of proportion, ect...it ranges from simple things like when I say I want to start reading this one book..he goes on to say it's a waste of time and to do something else (like play videogames?) and whenever I disagree or something he always finds a way to make me feel bad about my decisions. Another example is choosing what I want to do in school. I am a biochemistry major and am thinking of minoring in computer science. He says it's a waste of time and money to minor in something like that when there is somebody more skilled with a major in it. He says it won't help me at all and that I shouldn't even consider it. I was excited thinking about doing it because I am sort of interested in it and I remember programming when I was 12. I just want to try it out and see for myself if I like it or not. Plus I will be spending my own money. He is so quick to dismiss everything I say and voice his loud opinion and wants his opinion to be final. It's like everything I say that is a good thing, he turns into a bad thing. Or he picks at it until it becomes negative. Basically if my plan to do something (like a career or hobby) isn't 100% fool proof, I shouldn't do it at all. This has discouraged me from trying new things and gaining new interests over the course of my life. It has come to the point where I feel like I need his PERMISSION in order to do something. I don't know how to stop feeling this way. He always replies with \"Just saying.\" It makes me feel like I am not capable of doing anything and that nothing is a good idea.\nTL;DR:"}

My husband and I joined cricket and bought him a new Galaxy Grand Prime via their website. It arrived and was defective with a known manufacturer's defect on the screen. \n\nWe had to put down a $190 deposit plus pay for shipping to put in a warranty claim. The phone costs $130, but the deposit is $190.\n\nReplacement arrives, and has the same manufacturer defect. It is also a refurbished phone- we called to complain, and the rep tells us that they always replace phones under warranty with used phones. They wont allow a refund/return because by this point it had been more than 30 days since the original phone was purchased. \n\nAnother $190 deposit and shipping costs for a warranty replacement of the warranty replacement phone. We finally get a working phone after 2 months and 2 deposits ($380) and are out $30ish in shipping for the replacements. And its used/\"refurbished.\" \n\nThe fact that a \"refurbished\" phone has a known factory defect is very odd. It's a problem with the adhesive behind the screen which causes a quarter-sized bubble in the screen. There's no real way to fix it and it shows up pretty much immediately. So how could Cricket think that they could just resell a visually defective phone and call it refurbished? \n\nIs this legal? Should I report them to some business bureau? I haven't encountered a business that so thoroughly takes advantage of its customers before, so please let me know if there is anything I can do to protect consumer rights here.\nTL;DR:"}

Try letting them hold the bottle!\nPOST: I'm a 49 year old guy, and up until yesterday, if you'd asked me what my biggest phobia was, I'd have said eyedrops.  Every time I've ever had eyedrops, from when I had an eye infection as a kid to routine exams at the opthamologist, eye drops have been a horrific, dreadful experience involving somebody prying my eye open because I simply could not will it open knowing what was coming.\nSo when i was told i needed to use 3 different eyedrops 4 times a day for a month, I was kind of freaked.  Obviously, i was going to have to put in the work to get over this phobia, and it was going to suck.  It was going to suck bad.\n\nSurprise surprise, it was absolutely no problem at all.  My problem, it seems, isn't with eye drops.  It's with *someone else* giving me eye drops.  When someone else is trying to put something in my eye, my eye is all \"Nope!  Nope!  Nope!\"  But my eye trusts me.  It has no problem letting *me* put the drops in.  \n\nSo if your kid needs eye drops, explain that eyedrops are like tickling.  Your go nuts when somebody else does it to you, but not when you do it to yourself.  \n\nLet him/her hold the bottle.  You gently hold their wrist so you can guide their hand into position above their eye, and let them squeeze out the drops when they're ready.  You may find this gets the job done with a lot less trauma all round.\n\nIf they already hate eyedrops, have them do a dry run, just holding the dropper above their eye, knowing they're not actually going to put a drop in.  I was shocked and delighted to find how easy it was.  I bet they will be too.\n\nOr maybe not.  What do I know?  Try it and let me know how it works out.\nTL;DR:"}

My friends and I decided to have some fun on Friday night which resulted in some late night dropping of acid. I play in a school jazz band and the next morning we were scheduled to play at an outdoor ceremony commemorating military veterans being held at a \"safety village\". This place is like a tiny little town where small children learn basic safety techniques by playing out scenarios in a sort of simulated community. The thing about this place is, it already looks like an acid trip. The buildings are tiny to accommodate toddlers and they are all colored obnoxiously bright. On top of this Disney World architecture there is a little monopoly man mayor who drives around every once in a while in an old convertible. So I show up to play this gig and immediately I'm overwhelmed with this feeling of paranoia. It's like these veterans are staring right past my mediocre guise and straight into my shitty soul.These guys have seen everything and I know I'm not fooling anyone. I don't think I've ever sweat so much in my life. Eventually it came time to play an improvised solo and I can't even describe the emotion I felt while playing. It was unbelievable.

I was diagnosed with Autism a year before. My parents wanted to fix my behaviour so they went to see a naturopath. The naturopath  thought that we could do a gluten exclusion diet and concluded my bad behaviour was due to gluten intolerance (non celiac)\n\n After talking to my psychiatrist two weeks ago, I found out that my parents and the naturopath didnt' even properly execute the diet. They only did 1 test period, not 3. They didn't ask me for my feelings of my body pains/aches. They just \"observered\" my behaviour. \n\nNow they've been feeding me gluten growing up. I had gluten filled granola bars, rice krispies, pringles, etc for snacks and I never misbehaved. But when I did eat some gluten for  a \"treat\" (I don't even understand how a naturopath said it's okay to eat gluten sometimes when I \"was\" gluten intolerant), once in a while I'd have an episode and then their belief in my gluten \"intolerance\" was confirmed again.\n\nOver the years, they learned that the gluten filled foods I've been eating have gluten so my diet now is 95% gluten free. There are some things such as california rolls that I eat in front of them since they don't know california rolls havegluten.\n\nMy goodness I just want to make myself a jam and peanut butter sandwich again but my parents won't let me eat gluten at home.

I flew home for the summer during the current cycle, so now we have geographic separation for a few months.  She actually got her period on day 32 of this cycle, so there were 2 days in which you could call her period \"late,\" and in which we both worried a little bit.  (After all, we both know that her cycle length varies.) \n\nHowever, since we are geographically separated, she thought it would be funny to keep me in the dark about it for 2 days. Today is \"day 34,\" and she finally filled me in. So from my perspective, her period was 4 days late. Now, when you google \"period 4 days late,\" all you get is a bunch of Yahoo Answers and maternity forum posts about how you ought to get a pregnancy test because you \"might be preggers lol.\" \n\nI have always been a worrier, so these past 4 days have been less than stress-free. When we talked about her period on the phone or via video chat, however, I did my best to put on a strong face so that she wouldn't worry any more than me about possibly being pregnant. \n\nMy question: How should I react to this? I have already expressed that I was very angry with her, and that pregnancy is not a fucking joke.  After all, it would be my baby (or abortion) as well.

(Yes, it was a big mistake.)\n\nOriginally, I planned to put the tab on my student loans issued through the government. But when I left the school, things got screwy: the school returned the $18k in loans to the government lender, and left me to foot the bill out of pocket. (Don't ask me why they did this, it's another whole story and can't be changed at this point.)\n\nTo make matters worse, I wasn't even aware the situation until sometime after having left the school. Now a debt collection agency is hounding me for a ton of cash, and I make less than $20k a year.\n\nI can't finish college someplace else because the school is withholding my transcripts. So if I ever want to get my degree (which I'd like to), I'll need to save up $18k before I can pay them back and transfer to another university. (Again, I'm only making $20k/year. If I had my degree already, this wouldn't be as big of a problem. Alas, I'm in an infinite loop.)\n\nOn the plus side, since the money I owe to this school isn't in the form of a government loan, is bankruptcy an option? Should I consider it?

I have only ever been to her house when her parents have been away, and have never met anyone from her family (I have met plenty of her friends though, from various different circles).\n\nI hate the thought of making her feel forced to do anything, but it is making me feel kinda insecure that after all this time, she still won't introduce me to her parents. This issue came up a couple of times earlier in our relationship when she told me that she wanted me to meet them, but then backtracked on it. When I asked her why, she said there was no real reason but that it had kind of become a big thing now because she'd left it so long. We spoke about it a couple more times but then nothing since. This was about 8 months ago. I told her how it was making me feel. If it matters, she regularly talks to me about her family and I know she is really close to her parents and her sister. Her sister knows about me but her parents do not, as far as I know.\n\nSo, my question to you reddit, is am I being overdramatic? Am I wrong to feel insecure because of this?

She doesn't have a lot of inner thoughts so when we are together alone I usually have to begin the conversation or find a topic to talk about. We've talked about this before and she admits she is working on it.\n\nThe main problem is when we talk to each other.

As the night went on, she became really touchy such as laying her arm on my leg and putting her head on my shoulder. The next day, i got her number and went back to my dorm. A couple hours later, I got a text from her asking what you doing and what not. As the days went by she started to become more touchy nothing sexually and give me stare sometimes. In the few weeks, we been texting each other almost everyday saying good night. In a couple of our conversations, she says im make her laugh and happy but tells me she only likes me as a friend. Even after saying this, she still flirts and texts me first most of the time. I dont get what is going on. I have feelings for her but I'm not sure if she does as well. I dont want to get more involve just to get hurt. Please give me some advice on this situation. Should i stop talking to her? or Confront her about this?\n\nNOTES** She is generally a very shy and anti-social person but with me she just clicked right away and opened up. She beens going out with her bf for about a year and its a long distance relationship. Shes in America while her bf is in another country.\nTL;DR:"}

She was adopted as a child so she never knew her birth parents because she was abandoned, so her whole life she has struggled from self-image issues and depression. Because of these things, I have to spend a lot of time taking care of her and making sure she knows that everything is going to be okay, but lately she has stopped being thankful for that behavior and has become more mean(don't know a better word here) about it. For the first year and a half or so whenever I comforted her she would thank me afterwards and she would say that she was so thankful for having me but lately she just stays upset and is silent/crying for hours at a time. \n\nI've tried so many times to convince her and her parents to get her a therapist but her parents don't seem to believe that she needs one and my girlfriend is too afraid to firmly ask for one. Because of this, I'm her only outlet of her anger/sadness. Her depression has gotten to a level where every day there is a fight about something, regardless of how small or insignificant it is. If I don't text her during my lunch she'll cry when I see her next, even if I was studying for a test or had to meet with a teacher. If I say I rather would stay home and be with her than go out and be with her friends some nights she will get upset and say that I need to bond with her friends more even though I do.\n\nI just feel trapped in a sense. It seems like everything I do results in me being wrong, it's always my fault. I don't know the signs of an emotionally abusive relationship but I'd think that having your SO constantly making you feel guilty/wrong is one of them. I'd just really like some guidance as to what to do, every time I even bring up the topic of us not being together or her needing to get help for depression she will either lash out at me or start crying and not talk to me.\n\nThank you for reading this if you did\nTL;DR:"}

I live 4 hours away from them with just my husband. I have a part time job that is currently short staffed, so I have to work every Saturday. I RSVP'd the fiancee's sister saying I couldn't go, and then my mom asked if I was going, to which I said no I can't. \n\n**Situation:** \n\n[Her side] My mom says this is a \"sacred\", \"traditional\", \"important event that you should attend\". She said that even if I was fired from my job for taking the day off, I could easily just find another job like it.\n\n[My side] I've been at this job for 7 months. I wouldn't say I'm easily replaceable but it is just a bit over minimum wage job and easy to get hired for. I could probably get this day off with some flack from my supervisor. But more importantly, I don't want to drive 8 hours in one day (or 4 hours two mornings in a row) just to sit at some country club, eat a meal, and have meaningless conversations. I thought bridal showers were informal parties where close friends and family would bring gifts to the bride for her home & kitchen, not some formal family get together that absolutely requires my attendance. I told her to stop guilt tripping me and that the decision was made.\n\n**Result:**\nMy other sibling texted me saying my mom is in tears about it, how she feels bad that she didn't raise me correctly to be like this, being so detached from family, and then my sibling begging me to just take the day off and go because she's \"going through a hard time\".\n\nHow should I respond? I just want to get it through their heads that it is a REALLY huge hassle for me to make this happen and they have too high of a self-importance to realize it.\nTL;DR:"}

Recently, he moved back to his university and we have been long distance for a month now,  and I have considered in moving on and trying to date someone in my school instead. \nHe is obviously upset by this fact and called me pretentious and judgmental. I agree that he has all the right to be upset but I really don't know whether I'm breaking up with him because of is his background or my love is not as strong for him as I thought.

As a background, I'm an accountant and works in operations whereas this manager is a manager of a small back office but they do interact with my division on the daily. \n\nSo to start off, when I was first hired (from student to full-time), I wasn't well received as some people were quite upset that I was hired in this particular position seeing as most people start off in a different position that's kind of lower (the job itself is basically the same just the title is different). So from that start I was already being picked on (this attitude was received by the others who were hired at the same time) . During this time, I've probably had two complaints were I came up in management's emails for complaints about attitude from this female bitch (I was admittedly wrong the first time but the second time I wasn't even present/involved).\n \nNow, I've just received another complaint where apparently I took too long of a coffee break in both the early mornings and afternoon and I take too long of lunchs (a few of my coworkers go on break in the lunch room and eat lunch there as well). On average I go about once a week for coffee breaks and probably once every 2 weeks eating in the lunchroom. Again, I'm not even there 90% of the time and yet I'm being picked on again. I'm really annoyed because after the 1st time, I realized that I have this pretty decent job and I don't want to screw it up yet this bitch of a manager who's not even MY manager is still on my ass even though I pretty damn low profile. \n\nSo reddit, how do you deal with this type of 'office politics' bs?

Our relationship got ruined through lack of communication, putting school/everything else before each other because I (mostly) was letting my college anxiety take over my life. I've now settled my life into a schedule to where I can handle things without stress/anxiety. I've been thinking about contacting my ex because I've been missing her over the past month and when I gain enough courage to do so, I find out she's been dating someone for about 3 months. Ever since I found out the information, I've been extremely depressed. I'm not eating, haven't been working out, express no emotion, go to class, wake up and sleep. I wrote her an email apologizing for my mistakes and miss the idea of a friendship. After waiting a few days with no response, I decided to message her (this way I would know if she has actually read the message or not) just saying \"Not to bother you, would just feel a lot better knowing if you got my email by any chance\". Whatever may be going on, she still has yet to read that as well. I'm not going to continuously message her to give her space, but I have a feeling deep in my heart that we are meant to be together. We were best friends and did everything together during our relationship and now I feel as if a piece of my life is missing. What advice do you have to help her realize, if she truly does still love me, to push her back into the mindset that we are meant to be together?\nTL;DR:"}

I couldn't really believe what I was hearing and told him I wasn't comfortable at all with it, but he has already booked an interview for us BOTH, without my permission. He told me that the interview wouldn't mean any nudity or anything, we would just go and meet this woman, and get a full understanding of what would be involved, and that would be it. I am unsure how to proceed. He is so excited about it like a kid on Christmas Morning, but I just don't know. I am the total opposite of a prude and we watch porn together all the time, and we both regularly go to stripclubs together, so he just assumed that I would be cool with it.

The two young (under 3y/o) male cats beat her up every day causing things like ashtrays to go flying and glasses/bottles getting knocked over as well as the lady cat getting so scared she defecates. The males were just neutered no more than 3 months ago and generally wreak havoc on everything. They've chewed a corner off my study Bible (hence, devil cats), attack the dresses in my closet, scarves, yarn, they kill the outdoor plants on our screened in patio, are always on the counters/stove, they climb the screens outside, and they have repeatedly escaped by breaking the screens. Oh, and they've eaten my cigarettes! Worst of all, the male cats use my records that I keep in a milk crate as a scratching post, I now must keep them covered at all times so my valuable classic rock records aren't destroyed completely (as of now they're just damaged). \n\nI've tried my best to cope by keeping my bedroom door shut, keeping things covered and leaving nothing breakable near the edge of counters but they still manage to fuck shit up at least once a day. They clearly need to go outside to climb trees and kill lizards and run around without making things shatter. My roomie thinks they're fun (even though they knocked everything off his nightstand and stole his glasses, leaving them on the back patio for me to find hours later) and he is afraid they'll get hurt or lost if they're allowed outside. I say they're just fucking cats and let them be free, they're animals and they need space to act upon their wild instincts. He won't budge. The cats howl and cry all day and night. \n\nIs there anything I can do to try and convince him?

Any advice from someone with similar experience or even just opinions woild be welcome.\n\nThank you.\nTL;DR:"}

One day she mentioned that her Ex boyfriend who she went out with for about 5 years until second year college messaged her (They text sometimes as they remained slight acquaintances) about a shared diary they once wrote together regularly that he found. What bothered me is that he mentioned how \"cute\" the memories were and asked if she wanted to meet up to retrieve it. She agreed.\n\nI told her it made me feel really uncomfortable that she'd want to retrieve the diary, but she stated that she wanted it for herself since it was part of her past; wanting to see how she changed and that it had nothing to do with me. She also wanted to see what her ex has been up to(Which I don't mind as much as the diary). I told her that it bothered me because she's in a relationship with me now and that she'd want to read through a book she created when she was together with someone else. It also bothered me that she was going to do it despite my feelings. \n\nThe next day I sat down with her and told her that I'm not sure if I could feel better about this and I'm not going to stop her. She relented and said she felt bad about how this is making me feel, but after a long pause she decided not to get it.\n\nThe problem is now I feel guilty since I feel like I forced her. Was I wrong? Should I tell her to go do what she wants?\nTL;DR:"}

I was totally blindsided, shocked, hurt, confused, didn't know what to do with my life anymore... etc... for a certain period of time after that. All that said, my self esteem stopped me from pleading with him to get back together (after the initial one or two times). So I didn't. We cut all contact... in real life and in virtual.  Today I am doing much better. I am busy with my life, and I made several new friends. And I can think of him without getting all emotional about it. But, I still think of him a lot.

Jen says she wishes she could have bought 'Uglies' (I think that is the name of the book), but she only had enough money for one book; so, she bought a different one. Then Anna says, \"well, you read about as fast as I do, just hurry-up and finish your book and take it back to the bookstore with your receipt.  As long as you haven't had it over a week, you can exchange the book for a different one or just get your money back. That's what I do; that's why every week I have a different book.\"\nJen then asked, \"You can *do* that?\"\nBefore Anna replied I said, \"no, that is kind of like stealing, don't you think?\"\nAnna then said, \"I don't think so, that's what they do at a library, and it's free.\" \nI then tried, briefly, to explain to them that a library was meant for borrowing and education while the store was a business that depends on money to keep it running.\"\nThe girls kind of shrugged it off and due to the time restraints we dove right back into the math-lessons. \nNow, although I think her idea was brilliant, I still believe it is wrong of her to do this and i think this is a perfect opportunity to discuss ethics a bit, but I just don't know how to bring this up without sounding like a preachy **adult**!\nNow, looking back on the situation, I wish I would have used a completely different argument, too.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: What is wrong with me?\nPOST: Hey, so I'm still going through the aftershock of getting over someone I wanted to marry. About last year, I found that my ex was talking to someone pretty much all day and all night and they even had pet names. I got to a crossroads and had a choice to leave her or not but I loved this person and wanted to marry her, again, so I was stupid and stayed with her. Come a year later and I just started to trust her but I noticed she had literally zero interest in doing anything at all with me. During that time, though, I got her a job where I work because it was more pay and I was under the impression that we would finally move out, be happy and start a family. I have heavy abandonment issues from my father and I told her multiple times, if you are going to leave me for someone else, then leave me and just tell me. Things got worse and worse for us and eventually I brought up breaking up and then that was it. She got out of the car and since then, she ended up with the person I described above. I see her everyday and it makes me sad. Whenever I do something funny or even mentionable, the first person I want to tell is her but I can't. I miss her a lot but I know she is bad for me and that she probably wasn't genuine. I just wish I left before I began trusting her again. I had big plans for us and now I have no idea what to do. We both bought bikes together to try and do something but now whenever I ride by myself, I feel like crying but I kind of bury it. I miss having someone I could just look at and admire. She was beautiful and funny but I never really showed that because I always thought about the other person. I don't know what to do with my life but as of right now I just feel alone and empty.\nTL;DR:"}

But thinking back: we always had each others' backs at my old job, I could always depend on her, and we were pretty close when we used to work together. I'd known her for a about a year. So I thought I could trust her. I let her borrow the money.\n\nI was waiting to bring it up til after Christmas, if at all. I understand that she might be dealing with other bills or holiday spending for her family. I don't want to burn bridges with her. I still like her as a friend- but I still would like to be paid back eventually. How should I go about this?\nTL;DR:"}

Told each other that we didn't want to commit to being in a relationship as we only had a limited time left and she told me three times that she didn't want to be intimate anymore (as to not hurt me as she had other plans with other guys) . \n\nShe goes to her fuck buddy twice (both attempts fail) and tries to be flirtatious with other guys at this party and fails again. I'm left devastated as I liked her (she also told me that she liked me plenty of times) and I'm left feeling emotionally used, betrayed, which left me angry and sad for a month. \n\nCurrently, I'm basically over it, but I'm not sure if I want to see her immediately when I get back to college (I'll probably send her a text saying, \"I don't want to hang out atm\".  She's a really good friend and I do plan on telling her how much she hurt me as well as some mistakes on my part as well (not as bad as hers), but I'm extrememly worried that she's going to cut ties with me and fall even deeper into depression. \n\nIf you need more detail I'm happy to fill you guys in.\nTL;DR:"}

I've lived in Japan for a little while now, but started university in April. I'm doing a private homestay with my aunt and uncle's best friends (Japanese, but perfectly fluent in English). They have no children. My homestay parents are honorary members of our family, and I get along with them very well, and respect them a lot. \n\nI've recently began dating a guy, who is super special to me. We get along like two peas in a pod. Our relationship is really good, and going at a good pace. I'm a little bit more... life-experienced than he is, but he's maturing. He's shown that he is working on bettering himself and I trust him. \n\nI let my host mother know about my bf when we first got together... but I didn't tell my host dad because I was worried that he would judge him. Us three had a serious talk session tonight and the subject turned to dating. My homestay dad said things with the premise of \"You should only date completely independent guys. Anything else, is no good.\"\n\nI am so touched by his concern. But I feel like its completely unfair, based on my life situation. I'm a student, the only people I know are also students who cannot afford to be independent.  Furthermore, this is Japan, where it is in the culture for people to live with their families for a long time. My boyfriend seems like everything my host father says is wrong for a boyfriend. Yet my boyfriend is caring, kind beyond belief, and makes me happy. \n\nI need to tell my host dad sooner or later. Because I come home later, (after class, bf and I study, go eat, hang out) my host dad worries about me and ask where I've been. I don't want to keep lying to him. But I'm scared that if my host dad meets my boyfriend, he'll judge him and not accept him. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

We've had great times and some not so great. We really do have love and care for each other, even if sometimes it doesn't really feel like it. I know deep down in my gut I love her, even being away for a significant amount of time is tough. She has things she would like to work on herself, and so would I. We are both in college and summer break is upon us. We live about 3 hours drive from each other so it only seemed natural to designate this spot as a potential break point. She will be headed home to attend some counseling sessions in order to get herself in a better state of mind and figure out her beliefs and morals in a more productive way. I also would like to attend counseling as I do think it would be helpful in promoting self-growth & self-worth, but my insurance won't cover it. \nI'm just asking if anyone out there may have also been through a similar situation through this long break process and if things worked out for you afterwards. I know breaks can be just as healthy as time together, I'm just a bit unsure of how to process and proceed in this difficult time. I started keeping a journal today (we just decided today), writing down any thoughts or feelings I have about the relationship as they arise. It's been helpful so far, but I believe there might be tactics or advice that others have found in their experience that I might be able to find out there.\n\nThank you for reading.\nTL;DR:"}

We look alike and share similar traits and are commonly mistaken as twins or sisters. In our relationship, she has always been pretty dependent on me and some would say I am a bit more mature than her. I am not sure how to phrase this but some people interpret Ali as maybe a \"lesser\" version of me--not as smart, fit, etc--although I do not have this attitude towards her whatsoever. She is fairly insecure and I notice a sense of competitiveness from her towards me at times.\n\nNow, the issue; since school ended for summer, Ali has seemed to be distant from me. She's been hanging out with some new people, some that she knows I am not particularly fond of, and also hangs out with our small, close knit group of girlfriends and does not include me in the plans (she will make separate group texts with them and so on). I have a serious boyfriend so maybe she assumes that I'm busy with him? But she usually does not do this and it makes me feel very excluded.\n\nMy prediction with this situation is that Ali feels insecure being dependent on me. She's looking for a new-found freedom and independence and is in the process finding herself, not just following in my footsteps. I think it is good that she may be starting to find her identity and figuring out who she is. But, the way she is handling it hurts me. It's as if in order to find herself, she needs to isolate herself from me and feel as if she doesn't need me. It's weird to not have her as dependent on me and I'm unsure on how to handle it. Should I let Ali go through this phase of hanging out with new people and let her figure it out? Should I reach out? I am lost on what to do. Please help!\nTL;DR:"}

I dumped him because I felt he wasn't motivated enough and didn't do enough in life. I also unfortunately started dabbling in opiates and wasn't sure the break up wasn't influenced by my clouded thinking.\n\nWe got back together and I started taking suboxone.  The only issue was I couldn't get off of it and have become physically dependent. I started seeing a counselor for a few weeks but ended up not being able to afford it.

We worked hard to keep a clean and orderly home. Listened to each other and compromised.  He even went out of his way to make me feel special and started doing little nice things to make me feel appreciated.\n\nBut i got really depressed and I started sleeping all the time and not eating. When i wasnt at work I was asleep.  This bothered him, I could tell, and he really began to pull away. I felt like a nuisance and I felt unloved.

I checked her computer and found no files or pictures or anything noteworthy until I notice she has a Facebook tab open (she liked to have a LOT of tabs that she never closed).\nI found a convo from 6-10 months prior where she was back and forth messaging a guy she worked with about how much she loved him (but shouldn't tell him that) and when is he coming home (was away for school). It broke my heart, but then at the same time I was the one snooping. The last message was her suggesting they take it to cell phones and what was his number.\n\nI reached out to him and he said they just flirted a lot. I spoke with her and it was a huge thing about how \"I\" invaded her privacy and \"I\" was not giving her enough attention. She also adamantly says that when they started texting (and he would call her in the middle of the night randomly) that she stopped and said not to anymore because she felt like Facebook flirting seemed fine but that \"taking it to the phones\" felt too real.\n\nThis was years ago, I still want to know what really happened.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by letting my boss pay me on my phone\nPOST: This happened about an hour ago when I was getting off work.\nSo here's a bit of a back story. I work in an office with 2 other women, 1 of them my boss.  My boss is also ridiculously lazy. She'll come in between 9 and 10 sometimes later or not at all, put off work until the last minute she feels is too difficult, won't read long emails and avoids phone calls from clients. I've actually seen her run into the bathroom to avoid someone's call. Since she's bound to be fired soon, she's also nosey and paranoid. She'll walk into the middle of a conversation we're having and interrupt, asking what we're talking about. It doesn't help that she talks down to us on a daily basis like we're her children or younger sisters. Anyway, on to the fuck up.\n\nIn addition to my regular job I sell beauty products on the side. My boss makes much more money than I do and loves my products so I take advantage of that and let her purchase through me. I swiped my boss's card and handed her my phone to sign. A second later I hear her say \"Oh...\" as she reads a very hateful text I'd received just then from my coworker saying how annoyed she was with her today and how tense it made her. Honestly, my coworker left early today and had no idea I was making a transaction with our boss so I can't blame her terrible timing. I noticed the text pop up and tried to close it but the damage was done. I didn't react, because even though we can't stand her, we don't want her knowing that. She slowly signed her name (her normal speed for doing anything) handed me my phone and walked into her office.\n\nI think it's safe to say I won't get any more extra money from her, and it's going to be an awkward week for us. My coworker and I have decided that because no name was given we can play the incident off as if we were discussing a mutual friend. If anyone has a suggestion on a better way to handle this, I'm open to suggestions.\nTL;DR:"}

However my family is nowhere near the 1%. We are not poor, but I'd say lower middle class, (or maybe it just seems that way because of where I live.... ). I have the grades, and hopefully the intellect to go to a top university like Johns Hopkins, Carnegie Mellon, etc. but I don't necessarily have the money. I was talking with my parents tonight, and they were saying we would likely not be able to afford the $60k and up a year for a University like this, (without loans, debt, and etcetera) but it is a distant possibility. However in that case I would be on my own in terms of graduate school, which I certainly will be attending. The idea of going to a state school, Uconn, or a state school in other states, had been tossed around. The plan would be to save money in undergrad, get A's, and shell out the cash in a graduate program. I am confused as to whether i would be challenged enough at a state school as well, and if would truly work out in the best for me. At this point, I'm quite torn and do not what to do, as college visits and things of that nature loom in my future. I was just wondering if anyone has been through this situation and has some wisdom to bless me with. It would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I've come with another fuckup. \nA couple years ago, at my younger cousin's birthday party everyone on both sides of my aunt and uncle's family all went to their house for (like I previously mentioned) it was my younger cousin's birthday. On my uncle's side, he has a sorta kinda mildly autistic. This guy gets kinda crazy and I'm the apparently the only person that doesn't know how to handle him. So after dinner, we all decided to play wii fit. Autismo went to the washroom and sure enough I had to sit in his spot. As he walked into the basement, the first thing he saw was me sprawled on the futon he sits on. He then proceeded to sit and jump on me as I was screaming and pushing him off of me. All of my and his cousins laughed at me while I was getting the crap sit out of me. By far one of my most embarrassing moments.\nTL;DR:"}

It feels like 41 degrees outside (105 in freedom units) probably at least 5-10 degrees hotter inside the building. Realizing that that temps would stay like this for a week I was sufficiently motivated to get a haircut.\n\nSo I head to the closest barber shop; about a mile away and am told it would be about 20 minutes before I get my haircut so I go over to the nearby food shop and loiter around cooling myself off. I buy a carbonated apple drink to help keep hydrated and 20 minutes later get my haircut.\n\nAfterwards I walk to another shop and once my hair drys up I head to the bathroom to take some pictures for my friends. This is where my fuck up begins. After taking some pictures of myself I leave the bathroom with my drink, I notice people staring at me while I drink but me being the arrogant narcissist I am I assume I look so good everyone is in awe. It isn't until I get a text from one of my best friends that I realize that the carbonated apple drink I was drinking totally fizzed up while I was walking and looked very similar to piss which I just came out of the bathroom drinking.\nTL;DR:"}

When we first started going out she wasn't looking for a relationship. Since then we've grown into a couple, met eachothers parents, and gone on vacation together. Things in general are going well.\n\nHowever, she's secretive with her phone (full disclosure: I did snoop before and found nothing), goes out to drinks with coworkers, and went on a vacation without me recently where I know she was flirting with guys but nothing else happened. \n\nEvery day I'm just freaking out thinking she's going to cheat and leave me. I am head over heels for her and I know im coming off as controlling and needy but I can't stop. If I don't hear back from her for a few hours I start getting super nervous. I know she's a flirty type of person I don't think she would cross the line but it scares me that she might and I don't think she would tell me.\n\nI'm considering talking to her this weekend and potentially ending it. I hate feeling this way and its driving me crazy.\n\nI'd like to just ask her straight up of she's interested in continuing our relationship or of she wants to see other people. She said when we first started dating she could see a future with me but she still wanted to meet people and be young. One thing to another and now we're in a relationship but I just get the feeling that she still wants to talk and flirt with other guys and ibdont want to get hurt.\n\nWhats the best way to bring this up?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest\nTITLE: Anxiety\nPOST: Alright so lets kick this off by saying I have been single for about 5 months and in that time I struggled with confidence issues, feeling like I had no real friends (bar one really great guy) while simultaneously trying to break out of my shell and make some new friends. My lack of confidence made this difficult because I'm so so terrified of rejection. I guess I was, and probably still am, a little depressed too.\n\nRecently, I was invited to a friend's birthday. Well, that night I went out along with around 15 other people for dinner and I ended up getting drunk just to cope with being in a social situation like that. After dinner we left and went to a bar, then a club and I was enjoying myself by this point, in fact the night was great and ended well. I ended up going home with the birthday girl's best mate (no hard feelings) and we stayed up til 7am just talking. We went to bed and when we got up we decided we liked each other enough to date a little bit. We are now seeing each other which is cool.\n\nThe issue I'm finding is that she seems far more confident than me, has had more sexual partners and more boyfriends, and is far more in control. I worry that this is all going to end terribly with me doing something that she doesn't like and I'll be upset and embarrassed. We haven't been seeing each other too long but I do really like her. I just worry now that she is going to get rid of me when she realises I'm boring and shy and useless.\n\nOn top of that there's a few things going on at the moment in my life such as entering my third year of Uni, moving houses and getting seriously low on money which are getting to me. I just feel it all building up and my stomach is in knots. Fuck.\nTL;DR:"}

I felt things that I had never felt before, emotions that just didn't exist because I do not socialize much with girls and am quiet. My stupid \"goal\" for the night was to get kissed, though it didn't happen because those unexpected emotions put me into barf-mode. On the drive home, to drop her off, I turned 18, and a flood of even more emotions hit. Never sworn, kissed, drank alcohol, been in a relationship, the list goes on. It was quite the pity party in my head and the drive was silent, mostly. Nothing happened.\n\nSince that night, I haven't been able to sleep or eat or do homework. I can't stop thinking about everything that went on, those emotions, especially with her. There's a plate of rice in front of me but looking at it makes me sick. I want to say something to her to get her to talk to me, so I can listen this time. Tried texting, explaining things, but it was all my point of view and I didn't say what was really on my mind. And really, whats the hurt if after a month I won't see her again for probably a long time? I've lost 10 pounds and am running on three hours of sleep. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Our relationship is odd... I've never experienced anything like it before.  We're really close.  We basically know everything about each other and normally spend time every single day together.  I'm in college and he's in high school and he'll come over everyday and stay at my house until 11 when I take him home.  \n\nThe weird part is, we almost treat each other like we're in a romantic relationship.

In our 2.5 years, we've never had any serious problems. The relationship has overall been a sturdy one.\n\nHowever, lately I've been feeling as if the relationship is becoming stagnant. It doesn't go up or down, it's just kind of the same. I don't necessarily feel like I am happy go-lucky, but rather just content with the relationship. \n\nIt's making me lose the desire to put any sort of effort into the relationship. My girlfriend and I hardly flirt, it feels to me as if it's becoming a routine. Our sex life also isn't as frequent as it used to be. I don't want to come off in the wrong way, but I'm an all round flirtatious person; and my girlfriend and I don't do this anymore.\n\nDoes this mean my relationship is stalling? Although we don't live together, I see her all the time. She isn't really the type of person to go out or flirt with other guys or anything, she's more of the quiet shy type whereas I'm the exact opposite. I go out fairly often with friends, and I always feel a little jealous of them when I see them flirting and chatting up girls and what not.\n\nI don't know how to interpret these feelings so to say; or lack thereof. It obviously doesn't impact the relationship positively, and I have no idea what to do or what it means.\n\nShe knows I feel this way but is also clueless as what to do or what it means.

However, he keeps talking about how much he wants to make out with me, play with me, and we even sent pictures back and forth.

He's confused because I told him yesterday that I don't feel comfortable with that, and now I'm telling him that I want that. I said I'm just as confused. The rational part of me says that I barely know this dude, and it would be safer to suck it up and drive home. However, I really like this guy. Cuddling and kissing would be nice, but I doubt that we'd draw the line there. I've told him this, and he's still confused. \n\nAm I being confusing? Am I leading him on?

Our relationship is serious and I'm crazy about her, have been since we met. I feel like she's the best thing in my life because I feel like she makes me a better and stronger person. I could talk all day about her obv. I want to put a ring on it and have kids with this girl. We are both at university (in NZ), we met here. We've been talking for awhile about finding a flat and moving in together.\n\nEarlier in the week, something very intense happened to me. I got involved in a long argument a mutual lesbian friend of ours (Alison) was having about same sex marriage. This was on the uni grounds with some anti-gay religious people. After this we were at her place having some drinks and talking about the argument. Somehow talking about my own religious background (now atheist) suddenly turned into me admitting to her and myself at the same time that I was bisexual. I never acknowledge it before then and I've been reeling from the realisation since.\n\nI have to tell Lauren about this and I have already tried but so far I've just chickened out. I just don't know how best to go about this. She's always been vocally supportive of lgbt people (we have gay friends) but she's never dated anyone who isn't a straight male. Also I do think I want to explore this gay side of me, or at least there is an interest there. I have a couple crushes on guys I know and when I think about them I do feel an intense longing for being... *physical* with them. But of course, I'm very romantically attached to Lauren and during sex with her I feel very straight (I've almost never imagined a guy in her place during). Would laying all the cards out at once be too much? What should I keep in mind when talking to her? Have any of you been in this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

We lost that apartment because she lost her job and I Was the only one working. We stayed with a friend for a couple weeks and moved to Oregon to stay with her families friends. We left there, my girlfriend went to Indiana for a few months and I came back to Minnesota.  \n\nEventually my girlfriend came back, and we moved into her Grandparents house with her mom so all of us could save money and get back on her own. My girlfriend was lucky enough to get a job but I haven't been able to land one in the 6-7 months we've been here. At first, her grandmother told my girlfriends mom that we could stay there for free so we could get our lives back in order, now she's demanding $800 a month, with only 2 people working and trying to save money.  \n\nHaving to pay $800 a month wouldn't be bad, except that her mom is moving out in March,and leaving us here so there would only be ONE of us to pay almost a grand every month. If we can't pay her grandma that money every month, then we'll be kicked out. The only way that we'll be able to move out is if we have a couple thousand saved up, we have a co-signer for the apartment that's willing to help when it's necessarily but we can't even put a fucking deposit down because her grandmother is sucking all our money.  \n\nThe only choice we have no is the military, and according to a friend, the're being way more picky about who joins, and the way my shoulder is right now I wouldn't be able to join. I just need some kind of advice on what the fuck to do, I was couch surfing for months at a time and I just want to be stable.\nTL;DR:"}

It has been, by far, the best, most supportive, and loving relationship I've ever been in.  We've both met each other's family and talk a lot about plans for the future.  I am completely confident in him as a person and the direction we're going.  I am head-over-heels in love for him and see potential for this to be a very long term partnership.\n\nHowever, we haven't used the words \"I love you\" yet.  I brought up the topic in a really roundabout way approximately three months in (telling him \"I think I more than like you\") and right away when I did he, in a completely respectful way, said he didn't think we'd been together long enough to be discussing the topic of being in love.\n\nTwo months have passed since then, and I've been careful not to push the topic.  We both us the word \"love\" when we talk about each other (i.e., we've both said at one time or another \"I love spending time with you\" or \"I love that about your personality\", things along those lines).  I use phrases that are similar, telling him he's very important to me and I think he's a wonderful person, and he's always responded by saying he feels the same way.  Lately I've been feeling more and more like I can't contain the words and have a major urge to tell him that I am in love with him.  This is exacerbated by the fact that there have been so many recent tragic events (shootings, bombings, sadness, ugh) and I am constantly reminded that life is short and I might not always have the opportunity to tell him he's loved.  But, I'm nervous to do it because of our previous discussion.  I don't want to push him into conversations he's uncomfortable with, or seem like I'm beating a dead horse.\nTL;DR:"}

The boy, threw a fit and started pacing in front of the case cussing, and saying how much our restaurant sucks because we ran out of chocolate chip bagels and pastries, and how he never wanted to come here ever again. The mother, orders her sandwich ,and suggests that the kid should get a coffee. Finally, the little brat decides on a caramel macchiato. \"A\" looks at the woman and asks: \"would you like that a decaf?\" The woman nods, and her son whines about how he doesn't want it decaf. She gets checked out, and the brat gets a decaf. Later on, \"A\" and I high-five in the back prep room.\nTL;DR:"}

We split rent 50/50. \n\n---\n\nMy boyfriend has no problems with his friend being here. Maybe it's because he is oblivious. His friend is selling weed, smoking weed in the bathroom 3 or 4 times a day, sleeps until 1 or 2pm so I can't make ANY noise or I wake him up and he gets very pissed. His computer is on 24/7 and we have to pay the power bill for it, which isn't pretty. He eats about 50% of the food (which I pay for) and leaves my boyfriend and I with nothing. He has depression, and that is his excuse to not work. Sorry, but I've been diagnosed with bipolar since I was 12 and I am medicated since I was 13, and I work 40 hours and take 21 credits a week. His excuses don't mean anything to me. It's okay for 4 months to freeload, but he has no intention of changing.

I'm already wanting to move out, I have satayed the night here almost every night for 9 months. \n\n---\n\nI don't know what to do. Any tips or ideas would be great.\nTL;DR:"}

My cousin and I decided to go quadding and for some reason I decided to sit backwards on my quad, going full speed, and try to drive. I lasted about 10 seconds and then I accidentally jerked the handle bars to the right. I ended up being thrown in front of the quad and as I was falling/flopping around on the ground, I saw the quad tire coming straight for my head. I think I was knocked out because I don't remember anything after that. Magically I appeared back on my quad and my leg and chest were in a lot of pain. We were only about 500ft from my cousins house, so we went there. I told her what happened and she didn't seem concerned. I asked if we could go to the hospital and she said \"no, you're fine\". I was extremely pissed off so I started walking out of the house and was really dizzy and fell to the ground, at this point I am terrified and beg to go to the hospital, again she says \"no, you're fine\". I was INSANELY pissed off now, and the dizziness went away so I stormed out of the house and went home. I sat on my couch waiting for my family to get home, and by now I can't move because my ribs were badly bruised.\n\nThe funniest part was that my cousin flipped his quad a few months previous to this and he was driving a tiny 80cc going 1/3 of the speed and his mom rushed him to the hospital. He had NO signs of being injured and everything turned out to be fine with him.

In this time a lot has changed in my life (went from student to full time 'adult' job, moved countries, got a hormonal IUD, etc.). I was head over heels in love with him and had the best sex of my life simply because it was so emotional - it was just...there was just so much love. I LOVED being that connected emotionally and physically to a person.\n\nHowever, about 5 months ago we had a conversation about the future of our relationship. I am from Canada and he from Sweden, and while I have been living in Sweden for the past few years I would really like to move back home in the next year when my job contract expires. When I expressed that to my boyfriend he agreed that it would be good for me to go back home (i desperately miss family, friends, and a society where I can comfortably speak to everyone from a linguistic perspective), however he doesn't have a big desire. He could try living in Canada for a few years but he knows that he wants to settle down, raise kids, and retire in Sweden. It was a very emotional conversation, with lots of crying, and him ending it by saying 'I think you're going to have to break up with me in a year, it will be too hard for me to do it.'\n\nHerein lies the problem: we are in a great relationship, that will likely last for another year (we currently live together), however since that conversation I no longer feel emotionally connected and the sex has deteriorated. I am going to a therapist, reading self-help books, exercising regularly, eating right, essentially doing everything to get my mind and body as clear as possible, but I feel like I closed off my heart and now I can't re-open it.

Recently we put my house for sale as we planned on buying a new, bigger one together as we had discussed possibly starting a family. She left last week to go to her mother's house as she wasnt not sure about anything recently (if her job was the right job for her, friends, if she wants kids or not if our relationship is the one, if this is really love, etc). I understood (albeit I was destroyed) that she needed time but today after almost a week I wanted to contact and we talked: turns out she is is not sure she loves me anymore and apparently has been doubting this for a wile and has been going through the motions since things were going good but with every visit to sell the house she felt more and more pressure to figure her feelings out before moving forward. At the same time, she told me she wanted to put herself first once in her life as she had always put others upfront (including myself, friends and family) and she was confused about everything in her life and wanted to put some order. This is both our first real, lengthy relationship.\n\nI understand that she needs time for herself but I am absolutely crushed here in the meantime. I am not perfect, there are things I wish I could have done different and I have already told her that and that I am ready to do anything to make this work as we are a team and she is my partner. I feel like I am just sitting here waiting for judgement right now. \n\nI don't understand the concept where you are not sure if you love someone or not. In my mind, you either love someone or not.

Now she hasn't replied to my good night text. \n\nThis is extremely out of the ordinary. So I finally asked her about it, 2 times.\n\nThe first time, she said she doesn't know, and that she's probably just tired from work. This is demonstrably false, as explained earlier, she basically does everything except talk to me. \n\nCouple days later I asked again. That time, she said that she's just been \"busy\". It really doesn't seem like she's busy after work, or when she's off for the day. \n\nI decided to test something.

I met my girlfriend, Liz (not real name) while I was in senior school.  We didn't start dating until I got into college, at the beginning of this year.  Before we made the relationship official, we spent a bit of time together.  Liz is currently in her final year of school.  She is an amazing person and when we spend time together, it is great. We get along super well and I really like having her in my life.\n\nHowever, over the past month or two a few problems have come up and I am struggling with how I can deal with them.\n\nFirstly, Liz it quite shy and doesn't initiate sex.  This doesn't bother me.  However, what bothers me is the fact that we stay at each other's places and we don't have sex often because she either doesn't feel comfortable or isn't in the mood. When we do have sex it isn't anything special because she never seems into it or like she wants to be intimate with me.  I have tried talking to her, but I'm not sure how to change this situation.  I want to make her feel comfortable with me and I want to make sure she is enjoying herself. \n\nSecondly, due to her being in her final school year, she doesn't have a lot of time to spend with me.  I try to make plans in advance so she has time to finish off school work.  When I ask if she wants to hang out she generally says 'Probably not,' or 'I will try.'  This is starting to bug me.  I would feel bad to drag her away from her studies, but at the same time, is it really too much to ask for one day a week to see her?\n\nI guess I am not sure if she is excited to be dating me? And where I should go with this relationship?  I really like her. She is a super cool chick and I have a lot of fun when I am with her.  How can I fix these problems?\nTL;DR:"}

I meet up with him 2-3 times a month, and in return he gives me a monthly allowance. This is how I pay my tuition, rent, and living expenses. Our relationship is sexual, but I have no romantic feelings towards him. I have no qualms with what I'm doing, and I plan on \"sugaring\" until I graduate.\n\nThe only problem is recently I started seeing a guy, \"Tim\", who I really like. I never planned on dating anyone, but I met Tim and we clicked. We've been seeing each other for about a month and I haven't told him about my situation. I live a pretty lavish lifestyle and have no visible source of income, so when Tim asked about it, I told him a have a \"nontraditional\" job and left it at that. If he suspects I'm involved in something like this, he hasn't let on. He has expressed negative feelings towards sex workers in past conversations. I'm confident Tim wouldn't approve of what I'm doing.\n\nI really really like Tim. I could even see myself falling in love with him. We haven't agreed to be exclusive yet, but I have a feeling that he's going to ask me to be his girlfriend soon. I have no idea what to say. I want to be his girlfriend, BUT: a) I don't want to sugar behind his back, b) I don't think he'll want to date me when he finds out about my arrangement, and c) I can't afford to stop sugaring, and more importantly I don't want to.

He said he couldn't put the $800 for his part of the trip on his own credit card, so after many guarantees of no breakups and swearing he'd pay me back, I put his $800 trip on my credit card. 3 weeks later, he broke up with me.\n\nWe've remained friendly, but as of yet (2 months later), he still has not spoken with me about paying me back.  He owes quite a bit in taxes and has other financial concerns.

As I am driving home from work I was in the fast lane on the freeway and there was a cop in front me. Without realizing it I start ridding the cops ass. Not on purpose though. I wasn't paying attention to the speed and figured the cop was going the speed limit. The cop was going 80 in 65 and I was too. Then cop slow down to 50 so I slow down to 50. Next thing I know I am getting pulled over by this cop. I had never been pulled over before so I was pretty scared. I had my licence out and was ready. I rolled down the window and she started yelling me. Saying she thinks I am drunk driver. Then she asks where I am going. I say I am on my way home from work. She asks where I work. I say my companies name which has Wine and Spirits in the name. At that time she notices the big bottle of Crown Royal on passenger seat. She starts yelling louder how much have you had to drink today? over and over. I keep saying nothing. She makes me take my sunglasses off. At this point I am shaking because I am terrified.Then she briefly looks at my ID. She never asked for registration and insurance. I didn't get a ticket or anything, but I will never follow a cop again.\nTL;DR:"}

I would potentially enjoy having a child, but both of us are pretty fine with not having children.

Now, I was never informed that I was responsible for declaring my student status every year, and even worse, I wasn't even informed that they closed down my account.

I personally, don't think I want to get married. Ever. I personally just don't see a real benefit for me(being a male) since I could potentially lose a lot of my items and the divorce rates are so high that it's almost likely it would happen. It's a personal choice of mine. That being said, I would still love to be in long-term relationships just without getting married. I know that from a young age, women are so keen on getting married, having kids, the white picket fence, and the works. My problem is that, I feel like I won't be able to have long-term relationships since women want marriage usually after 2-3 years and I probably don't want it at all. Would it be possible for me to find a women to be with for a long time(potentially for life) but without having to be in a legally binding contract with her? Or do I just have to accept the fact that if I want to continue being in a long relationship with a woman, I have to marry her even though I don't agree with marriage?

Being the new guy, my parking space is in an overflow lot about a mile from my office. And today when I pulled in it was raining buckets. By the time I got to my building my walking shoes were completely waterlogged. Fortunately, I have a spare pair of shoes in my office for occasions like this one, but what I didn't have were extra socks.\n\nSo, I'm sitting there at my desk, shoes off, wringing out my dripping socks. I glance around to see if there's anything I can use to dry them with. And this, friends, is where I make a poor decision. My eyes come to rest on the microwave. I have a brief internal debate about whether microwaving a fetid sock will leave an awkward, lingering smell in the office. Meh, I can always open a window. In go the socks.\n\nI nuke the first sock for 15 seconds at a time until it dries out nicely. Plus, it's toasty and warm when I slip it back on. Bonus! Now it's time for sock two. I repeat the procedure. But something's not right when I open the microwave. The smell isn't of fetid sock, it's of\u2014burning sock. Oh, shit!\n\nSo, I manage to smother the sock before it bursts into full flame, but there are huge holes singed all through it. I try folding the fabric over to make a fake ankle sock, but there's not enough unscorched sock left to make it convincing. Also, the burnt fibers stick uncomfortably into my feet like velcro hooks all day.\n\nThe upshot: I stood the whole day to take advantage of what cover my slacks could provide me (not much), but I'm pretty sure students noticed. Also, played dumb when a coworker asked if I smelled something burning (\"Not really\" sounded better than \"It's just my clothes!\").\nTL;DR:"}

Let's just say there's a very good reason I hate talking about it.*\n\nShe's said things like this before, not often but frequently enough for myself and a lot of our friends to notice, but she always refuses to elaborate. I'd never say this to her face (or to anyone without the veil of anonymity) but I think it's a possibility that she's pretending she was abused? She loves being the center of attention.\n\nA couple things to note: Alex has said that she's interested in older guys \u2014 as in, seniors in high school or guys in college \u2014 and this was going on at least during the last year of middle school as well. A lot of pictures on her Instagram, intentionally or not, make her look older than she is, and she frequently acquires Internet suitors in that age range. She's shown me some of their conversations and the guys can get *creepy*, even or especially once they discover her age. Despite that, she'll keep talking to them.\n\nI don't know if she was actually abused and I hope I'm not a terrible person for having doubts.

She told me that she didn't mind not seeing me the past week and she felt bad about it. It shocked me and I couldn't bring out a single sentence at that moment.

We're just getting to know each other but she seems like she is interested enough, and this weekend we're going on a trip into town for the long weekend with my room mate (23/m) and a few others. My room mate is the issue. He's already an incredibly competitive person but not forwardly so, but he seems to use sexual conquest, lifting weights, and fabricated stories of excellence to validate himself. He will tell stories about having sex with his ex's best friend feigning regret but really I can tell he's bragging about being able to accomplish this. So some girl he knew from back home is coming out for the weekend and I've heard him talking to her online about how he loves her and such and such, but just today he was talking about how angry he is at her for some minor offense and now I can't help but think he's going to try and sleep with this girl I'm interested in out of the conquest nature of it. Any advice about what to do? Maybe I'm paranoid?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: If you contribute to society, is it wrong to use welfare programs? How does one decide which subsidies and government programs are moral or immoral to use?\nPOST: Many people, Redditors included, seem to hold a negative view of welfare programs such as SNAP (food stamps) and housing vouchers (aka Section 8). The general consensus with these programs is that they are only to be used as a last resort if one is on the verge of going without housing or food.\n\nOn the other hand, there are plenty of other government subsidies that most believe one would be stupid not to use. Tax credit programs for houses subsidize the purchase of a new home, and a couple of years ago I could have used \"Cash for Clunkers\" to get a few thousand dollars off a new car at the expense of other taxpayers. Public colleges and universities are subsidized at the expense of taxpayers as well (as well as subsidized federal student loans). Many businesses also take advantage of government subsidies; some wouldn't be around were it not for federal assistance.\n\nWhy exactly is it immoral to use food stamps or housing programs, but okay to take advantage of a whole host of other government programs? Is it the idea that the people who use welfare programs are invariably lazy, want to use the program chronically, and don't contribute to society? In other words, what is the difference between someone taking several thousand dollars out of the pot to go towards their new home, versus a poor person taking that money to go towards food?\n\nSay someone is working full-time at (near) minimum wage and therefore eligible for SNAP. Or someone becomes temporarily unemployed and doesn't know how long it's going to take for them to find work. Even if they are not literally on the verge of starving, is it a problem for them to use the program? In either case the person does contribute to society, and they are working on getting to a point where they don't use and aren't even eligible for these welfare programs. That money can really help even if it's not a life-or-death necessity; the eligibility requirements are what they are for a reason.\n\nI do realize that these programs are abused, but my question is more in regard to the morality of food stamps on a personal level rather than a societal level.\nTL;DR:"}

The project requires a 45 minute interactive classroom experience and binder containing every single assigned step of the project we have completed. Neither of groupmates have contributed much of value this entire time, and anything they've done has had to be re-done. We had to bring in articles, and theirs were shitty/from bad sources, and neither of them sent me the links like I asked.

I've been waiting since Tuesday! \n\nIt wouldn't be so horrible, but the 45 minute classroom experience can't be a powerpoint and must be original idea to let people be \"immersed\" in the topics rather than being taught them.

Serious sanding, hammering, etc.  It's an inconvenience to us, but she has legal right to make whatever noise she wishes during noise-ordinance hours, and adheres to those.  It's her money; if she wants to refinish every piece of built-in furniture her landlords own, good for her.\n\nThe problem we (owners) have is that during the last 2 weeks, the neighbor (renter) has begun to randomly verbally assault us and mutilating outdoor shrubbery that belong to the community.  The neighbor seems to have some serious emotional issues which she is targeting at us (closing doors too loudly any time of day, etc) AND THE SHRUBS in comparison to the outrageous noise she makes during \"legal\" hours.\n\nWe obviously know the neighbor is not running at 100%, but are considering contacting her landlord.

If we like it I'm open to exploring a few things (but not much). I have been looking forward to it.\n\nWhen we decided to go last week I began investigating new lingerie I could wear (strict lingerie only dress code) and found several outfits that would flatter my body and make me feel sexy, I showed them to my boyfriend and he seemed really happy. Then the next day he tells me not to order as he has purchased something for me. It arrives in the mail and I hate it.\n\nI hate the colour, there's no support for my boobs, it makes them look small, it hides my tiny waist and exposes my fatty fleshy flabby hips that I hate.\n\nIt looks nothing like what I showed him, I don't feel confident or sexy and he's so proud of himself for choosing it I don't know how to tell him I would feel miserable and fat if I wore it. I am angry get he took away my opptunity to choose something that would have made me happy, especially considering this is such a new and confronting experience for me.\n\nEven if I did fess up and tell him I dont like it, we don't have enough money to purchase something else until after its over.\n\nI'm having my wisdom teeth out tomorrow in hospital, which I'm completely freaking out about anyway, and I'm considering just hamming it up and pretending I'm still in pain next week so I don't have to go.\n\nI don't want to wear it, don't want to hurt his feelings....

I am so content coming home to him every night, going to the gym together, cooking dinner together, etc... (Obviously there are nights where we do our own thing, but in general, we both love doing these things together). \n\nNow, I have a close knit circle of girlfriends who don't have a similar relationship with their SO as I do (except for 1, who is married now and we don't see her as often unfortunately). Half of them are single, and the other half are in relationships, however those in relationships don't live together and maybe see each other every 3 weeks, if that. Sometimes we hang out all together with SO's but because we are a close group of girls, it's normally just girls nights/hangouts.\n\nI feel like they expect me to have a better balance between them and my SO. I see them at the very minimum, once a month, some I see every week or two. I think that's pretty fair? \n\nAnyway! My real question is how do YOU balance friends and SO?\nTL;DR:"}

Because this would take longer, I had to leave my house around 5:40 am. I was less than three blocks from my house when an older black gentleman (maybe 40) with dreads down to his (not so covered, I would find out later) buttocks, slowed his car to a crawl and sidled up next to me. He remarked on how nice my \"shape\" was in my work clothes and continued to yell gratuitously sexual comments at me. Having grown up in a not-that-great city, I was used to this kind of behavior, so I just ignored it. Well, he pulled up to the next corner, parked, got out of his car, and proceeded to walk with me the three or so miles to my office. He told me his entire life story, intermittently throwing in two-syllable \"day-umms\" and leaning back to one side. I was too tired to do anything but let him walk with me. After nearly an hour, I had learned that his name was \"Quezzi\" and he was a rap-artist-come-janitor at a local elementary school. I told him that he shouldn't be bothering people this early in the morning, and about three or four blocks from my office I told him that he was going to have to leave me alone now. He tried once more to get my \"411\" (he hadn't advanced to the digital age yet, it seemed) and I explained to him that my boyfriend, Fred the veterinarian (I was on the spot, okay?) would not appreciate that.\n\nI now carry pepper spray.\nTL;DR:"}

I have tried to bring it up but he won't talk about it with me, he is under a lot of stress at work, but I still cant understand why my question which was not meant to offend (I said it in a nice way and not with any mean or sarcastic tone, I would never want to make anyone feel bad during sex) seems to have caused such a problem.

Recently we'd been feeling eachother out to see how we felt about marriage down the line, kids etc. All those serious important conversations. We seemed to line up on everything, and made each other very happy. At least, apparently I was happy. \n\nTurns out he doesn't really like pets. And I have two cats and a large dog. He had been under the impression that someday once my life had settled down, I'd give up owning pets, and just be content and happy with a husband and kids. He was shocked when I told him that my life has always had pets, and will always have pets. I suppose he thought it was a phase or something? \n\nThis led to more conversations where it turns out he doesn't really like the current person I am; but likes the person I'm working towards becoming. As in, I'm currently working on getting my finances in order, and going to therapy to deal with stress, anxiety, and childhood trauma. \n\nAll of this together, was kind of a what the fuck moment. I told him that I could potentially deal with dating a non-pet loving person; so long as he could deal with the fact that they'd always be in my life. But that I couldn't deal with someone who only liked some idealized future version of myself. \n\nI'm already doubting myself, and my resolve. Do you think I did the right thing?

Well, once I gave him my password to the career site, he goes to my profile to check it. I mean, it wasn't a huge deal but it bothered me because there was no way he went to my profile accidentally. And then last night, he told me he invaded my privacy again and looked at my resume, which is funny because I deleted it which means he either stalked my previous job applications or he had seen it before. \nI think I'm making a big deal out of it, so I'm not sure I should even bring it up, but I can't let it stop bothering me.

He introduced himself, asked for a photo with me, and didn't leave my side the entire day.\n\nIt's important to note that this boy was new, so none of my coworkers knew him either. \n\nIn the afternoon, he asked me out for that evening. I told him that I had a lot of work, but he convinced me to postpone it and go out with him. I met up with him just as the sun was starting to set, and everything was magical - music, lights, he immediately took my hand, treated me to dinner, bought me flowers. \n\nAnyway, I ended up spending the night with him. He was leaving that day, so we didn't see each other again, but he texted me the entire day and hasn't really stopped since (it's been a few days). He's acting very serious, saying I have to visit him in his country and claiming to want to be together longterm.\n\nMy reservations stem from my local coworkers. None of them liked him - they thought he was hitting on every single girl there (though this is not entirely true, because I witnessed some of the incidents and he merely asked for a photo with a pretty coworker of mine). My boss even told me to be careful. \n\nWhen I raised these concerns to him, he gave me the very standard \"don't worry, they're just jealous\" - but they have nothing to be jealous of!

Over the week we would have miscellaneous fellow cadets over to help with various fiery stunts.  Our exploits ranged from attempting to light a Sabre on fire to creating a taser.  We still have more to try such as coating the sabre in gasoline or diesel.  We also discovered that foaming Lysol when allowed to foam to its fullest extent will cause a small fireball.  The Taser that we created is used as a \"fire stick\" where we light a bowl of lighter fluid on fire with a loud and bright spark.  This past night we created to coup de gras of our stunts.  We created a Jam Jar Jet out of a pickle jar, a Zippo and a lot of hand sanitizer. (for those who don't know what that is [Here you go] It scared the living shit out of both of us.

She intended to meet up at her current place with one of my roommates before coming over here, but due to poorly worded texts and not responding to anything the day of, my roommate thought the get together she organized was at her place instead of ours. This led to a conflict and got her kicked out that night. The next day she texted me to apologize and say that hopefully we could hang out again soon. The day after that I asked about it again and she said that she would try, but it had been a difficult week for her.\n\nSo, I waited until that following friday (a week ago from yesterday) and texted asking how her week/weekend looked because I wanted to make up for the previous weekend. I believe she was out with a couple of mutual friends at the time and probably didn't want to respond right away necessarily, so I didn't take it too personally until it was already sunday with no response whatsoever. Stupidly, I decided to send a second text asking if she got the last one. No response again.\n\nI'm a bit perplexed by this. I've never pestered her about anything, and the last time we spoke she was the first to want to hang out again. Is there a part of this I'm missing?

This is where things get dicey, because over the next few days she tells me she actually spent the night at said guy's house with his band mates and also finished an entire bottle of wine on her own, making her drunk at a guy's house I've never met nor known.  Spending the night, she is then driven to work the next day and her co-workers apparently notice that she looks a bit ragged and ask her how her night was.  \n\nSo, this is where I am.  I ask /relationships/ in an effort to determine how I should feel about all of this.  Does it sound oddly curious?  Should I bring down the hammer?  Is this commonplace with couples in some kind of connection I am unaware of?  Should I worry if she cheated on me, or is that too irrational?\n\nJust tell it to me straight because I have been racking myself over this for days and been soothing this burn the best I can.\nTL;DR:"}

She was my first kiss/hookup and my orginal intentions were to give dating a shot but I never really talked to her about it. Fall formal night I'm taking her home, and after talking about what a great night it was I mention that we should go on a second date and see where it goes from there. She kind of smiles but doesn't really say anything and we kiss one more time and we go our seperate ways. Fast forward to a month later, we still had not gone on a second date and neither of us had really brought up fall formal since that night. I had attempted once to ask her on a date but she had planned to go up to Massachussets for the weekend but never did and never told me she wasn't going. Then later that week I find out that she apparently likes a good friend of mine and they've gone on a few dates. Although I still have feelings for her do I give up and apologize for promising some dates that I never followed through with and accept that we've both moved on or some other course of action? \n\nP.S. sorry if rediquette is not on point, first time\nTL;DR:"}

She is leaving to grad school that is a few states away in a couple days and I have one year left in my undergrad. Our career paths will be different, too once I graduate. \n\nShe will finish grad school in two years, but once I graduate I want to work in any other state than the one she is going to. I want to work somewhere where I could have the company pay for one of my grad schools of choice. She could meet me after grad school, but we would be two years apart, besides infrequent visits.\n\nThe relationship itself is good, but not great. We argue and get upset 2 to 3 days out of the week, but always resolve things. She still talks to one if her douche bag ex's behind my back, but would never cheat. I get really irritated when she doesn't fill me in on things/details and she says I am too western. So I try to be lose about plans and times and meet her half way. The intimacy is great and we mediate between our interests in it. Hers less than mine, but not so much so that it is a deal breaker.\n\nI am working and taking classes over summer and it makes me really tired and it is difficult not to get anxiety during this and sometimes she is understanding, but other times it just makes her upset with me. I feel like she needs to work on this because I am nothing but supportive of her troubles.\n\nSo my question is what do I do? Is the two years and frequent irritation a normal thing? Can it be worked out? Or is the state separation a chance to let things go?\nTL;DR:"}

I love my wife's family and love her as the mother of my child, but I think I made a mistake in marrying her. I had just gotten out of a 3 1/2 year relationship one year prior to us getting together. I wasn't ready to settle down so quickly and I'm bitter over that--no one to blame but myself, I know. \n\nAnother problem is we fight constantly. She's very stubborn and comes from a relationship where she was cheated on so she's very suspicious. We hadn't even been officially dating 2 months before she got pregnant and she comes from a very religious family so not getting married wasn't even an option. \n\nMy biggest fear is not being able to see my daughter every day, which is keeping me holding on.

But in the past few months I came to slowly realize how different my wife is compared to me, she started showing me how very opposite to me she is through her words and actions, her outlook on life, etc. A lot of the things she said were not compatible with my lifestyle and career, and make me think I married a much younger women who isn't experienced with life. I'm very upset she didn't say any of these before marriage, otherwise I would have dismissed her immediately. It's as if she hid all these bad traits at the beginning and now I feel I got duped.\n\nExamples\n\nShe is very negligent, has lost alot of valuable things like jewelry and it's not a big deal to her.\n\nShe says she cannot leave money lying around in her purse, it has to be spent.\n\nShe forgets ALOT\n\nWe had alot of arguments about these issues and every time I tell myself that I cannot continue with this, I cannot change her as a person, and I need to end this marriage before it becomes worse.\n\nThe day after our last argument we found she was pregnant (confirmed by doctor). Given the above, this obviously made me depressed and \"stuck\" . (I was stupid not to follow my own rule which was to wait a few months before going unprotected). Our families know about the pregnancy and abortion is not an option (personal, cultural and legal reasons)\n\nI am confused on what to do in such a situation ...

I'd originally contacted her about a year ago after we first got engaged because her work was alright and her prices were some of the lowest in the area. She seemed sweet. When we decided recently that we were going to elope in DC and celebrate the next day with everyone in Baltimore, our photography needs changed so that most of the area's photographers were suddenly almost all the same price. Still, my FH liked this one best, so I contacted her and told her our new plans. She was nice at first but then started trying to hurry us to sign the contract, which rubbed us the wrong way. And since it was the first big wedding thing we were doing, it was really scary and I wanted to slow down the process a little! Or at least finalize some other things first or maybe meet her. But she wants the contract and invoice ASAP. She sent both to us and tried to schedule our engagement session, but I told her we needed some time to talk about things and I'd get it all back to her in a few days.\n\nSince we got really bad vibes from all of that, we decided to look into another photographer. This one is a couple that has a lot more experience. Their prices are only $50 more expensive, and I honestly like their work better. They've been very responsive and awesome so far and have asked to Skype with us tomorrow briefly to talk about our plans (first photographer never offered to Skype or meet with us). I really want to go with them.\nTL;DR:"}

Meeting her parents next week.\nPOST: This is my first girlfriend and we've been dating for between 5-6 months. Things have been going well for the most part, we spend a lot of time together (every weekend at least for a whole day if not both days; as well as 2-3 times together during the week) but I feel like I'm not that attracted to her physically and I haven't been wanting to involve her in things I do with my friends that much. I feel like I've been neglecting my friends, I want to focus on my career (this is somewhat of an excuse), and I want to live life single again without a long term committment. \n\nThe main problem is that I feel like she has stronger feelings for me than I am into her, although I'm not sure if she realizes this. I also don't really share my feelings that well with her so this would come onto her as a suprise. To make matters worse I've already agreed (a couple weeks back) to eat with her parents when they visit her next week. To her its a big deal to introduce me to parents and I feel like she thinks things are getting more serious between us. \n\nI'm not really sure how to proceed with this - should I wait until her parents leave? What's a good way to bring up the topic? We don't really share our feelings for each other that much (both very reserved people) and I know this will definitely hurt her and things probably won't end well. The main problem is that I haven't really given any signals that I'm losing interest and I've been pretending that I'm in it for something serious while I'm actually not. I've never had a significant other before and I've learned some things from this experience, and I want to break up with her before things get even more serious and it will be harder to let her go.\nTL;DR:"}

Even though I never asked her to end it and we never talked about exclusivity - isn't it kind of strange to keep something going on with two guys at the same time - and not like in secret but completely open?

I mostly won't admit to my parents that i'm insecure because they would just say \"No you're not\" and blow me off and not make a big deal of it. I know that they actually know deep down i'm insecure, I suck in my stomach all the time, I sit so my thighs won't touch each other or look big, I do basically everything to keep anyone from noticing. The other day, my dad said i'm getting chubby, and he doesn't know how much I was hurt by it. He doesn't understand that I devote most of my time to keep myself from looking that way. The funny thing is- I'm the average weight for my height. I feel like my dad is just saying i'm chubby to make conversation maybe? But it hurts to be that girl that feels bigger than the rest.\n\nAcademics- I have some kind of learning disability. I have no idea what it is, but I was tested on it and they can't sum up the answer to what my issue is. I think I'm old enough to understand this means i might be dumb, or i'm just not trying. I try as hard as I can to get good grades, but it never seems to happen. People dont necessarily *bully* me about being the duller one, but I stick out. I make fun of myself to get laughs, and move on. It *hurts* to fail a test when all of my class mates get As and Bs. It *hurts* to have a blank expression when the teacher calls on me and everyone else knows the answer. \n\nI also hate to complain because every time I do say something like \"Oh I probably shouldn't have cake, i'm trying to lose weight\" they dump all of these empty complements on me. I know that my loved ones care, and I'm happy they take their time to tell me they feel badly, but saying \"you're beautiful\" won't make me shit out roses and lollipops.

I don't know much about her, except that she overdosed on pills she was addicted to. He sometimes talks angrily about how she would never hold down a place or feed him and his brother. And other times he talks about how funny she was and how he loved her. But it's very rare I hear him talk about her. He has never seemed really upset or depressed about it. I thought he just didn't really care. He's said before that he was glad that Jesus had her. \n\nBut last night he put a song on in the car and said to me that he listened to it everyday after his mom died for the longest time, but hadn't heard it in forever. Well I looked over in the middle of the song and he was crying like I've never seen anyone cry before. And I've never even seen him cry. And I had absolutely no idea how to console him. I really think he hasn't shown any emotion about his mom because he's hidden it, but the song just brought it out. He has never even visited her grave. \n\nI was thinking I could buy some flowers and take them to her grave on the anniversary day of her death, but I don't know if I should do that. Would it be better to let him suppress his feelings and not drag him down there? Or should I buy the flowers and suggest we take them? I don't know if he would appreciate the gesture, or if it would just depress him. But I don't want him to think I don't care. And I don't want to bring up bad feelings either. :/ Has anyone else been through his type of situation and know what I should do? \n\nAnd what should I do if he cries again? Other than hold him and say \"I'm sorry.\" I had no idea how to react the last time other than to cry with him. In what way could I make him feel better?\nTL;DR:"}

This guy isn't playing with me, as I've met his family, his friends and overall I know he loves me, respects me and is serious about me.\n\nI'd never really thought seriously of marrying him because of our short relationship, but I also know that this is something that is really important to me and that I always knew I wanted to marry more or less at 25.\n\n**The real thing here is...As all mighty and knowledgeable men: Do you think with time and with actually realizing he's with a good woman, compatible with him and everything, he might think differently about marriage? He has it really clear that he does want a wife and family (ie, he's not at all opposed to marriage), but his idea at the moment is that this will be later on in life. He also has several young married friends and cousins, so it's not something he is \"kept away\" from.\nTL;DR:"}

About a week later I ask her out to dinner, and she says yes, without hesitation, in the most adorable way imaginable.\n\nThat same day I ride the train back with her and her co-worker.

Now, obviously she thought I was older, and I certainly get that from a lot of people. She then says that I'm just a baby, and that I'm too young for her. She turned out to be 26. I figured she was just teasing me, so I played along and made a joke about her being an old timer. She laughed, I laughed, and we talked some more until I arrived at my stop. We say goodbye and that was that.\n\nFast forward a day before our date, I send her a text following up on our plans.

He isn't really a high-strung JR (and for that I am very thankful), but we socialized him very early in the community dog park.  He's 2 and we've been going for a year and a half.\n\nWhen we first brought him there, when he wasn't even fully grown into his 17 pounds of almost pure muscle, he would -always- play with the big dogs.  His best friends were two dobermans.  There was never a big dog there that hurt him, and he always stood his ground.\n\nNow he doesn't want anything to do with them.  We take him to the park daily at the same time, usually there are a bunch of regulars with the occasional once-in-awhilers.  All of the big dogs love him and want to play with him, but he just runs over and hides between my legs.  Sometimes he snaps at them when they get too intrusive, but he never bites.

Ideally while the children were young.\nPOST: So a bit of backstory will be required. \n\nI was with my ex for about a year and a half and to begin with it was great. Towards the end it got boring, the spark went, i made attempts to fix it and save our relationship but she pretty much rejected all of them. Eventually i decided it wasn't worth it and was going to break up with her. I guess she suspected that because not long later, before i fought up the courage to break up, she told me she was pregnant. At this point i thought she had been on the pill. This of course caused many arguments.\n\nI won't go in to detail about the arguments but ultimately it ended with us breaking up completely a couple weeks later, with me suspecting that she stopped taking the pill on purpose. \nIt's now 7 months later and i've been away on  military deployment in that time and we're still broken up and she still has the baby, due to give birth on 30th March.\nI do not want to get back together with her as i can't forgive what she has done and suspect that if we did get back together it would be the same as it was when we broke up except there will be child. I am only 23(she is 27) and i currently live about an hour and a half drive from her because of the Navy however i'm leaving soon with plans to move home however that is even further from her.\nTL;DR:"}

To do this, I just started r/surprises. The problem is that I am not at all tech savvy or good with Reddit (to an embarrassing extent), so I am asking for some help. I signed r/surprises up but what's next? How do I recruit people to help out and how do I spread the word? \n\nAny tips at all on how to make r/surprises a thriving community would be great, especially from any community mods. My vision would be to start a community based on organizing surprises while, of course, maintaining privacy and safety. This could include anything from organizing with local Redditors a surprise for a friend who has been down recently to helping someone plan a cool proposal. My intent is to avoid things that cost a lot of $$ as a way to curtail scamming attempts, but I am open to anything. It seems like reddits with a charitable slant tend to encounter a lot of problems, so any tips on how to avoid scams would be appreciated. Also, I know r/favors can kind of be for this purpose but I think it would be easier to organize surprises with a specific reddit just for that. But since this is for the community, if this is a horrible idea then I wont be hurt if you let me know :)\nTL;DR:"}

All these people I thought were my friends only see me when he is conveniently unable to attend (which is almost never).

I have brought it up, but he tells me he just doesn't like using his phone/prefers face-to-face. Reasonable, but it makes me feel like he doesn't care about me because he's fine with no communication in between seeing each other. And, he's fine with seeing each other twice a week (usually Thursday nights and Sundays) - in the beginning it was okay, but we have been together for 9 months...so I would want to see him more. \n\nI know he's been stressed lately, with trying to find a job and moving out of his apartment soon, so I try not to probe too much.

Then last week, she hung out with her friends and got drunk and I got really upset and told her I didn't want her to do that and she said she wants to get drunk with me after I told her I was not okay with it and I told her why I was so against it and she still didn't seem to care.. then yesterday, she went out with her friends again and got drunk off her ass and not I'm past the angry part... I'm just sad. and not because of what she did, but because of how proud she is of all the she drank and I don't know what to do anymore.. I love her and I think she loves me too, but it's really upsetting how se doesn't respect me in that way. And don't get me wrong, I let her do whatever she wants. This is the only thing I don't want her to do. Drink, and the occasional weed, and I don't know what to do anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

Sexting other girls, asked multiple girls to be his girlfriend whilst with me for around a year. \nI for some reason just kept pushing it aside like it was nothing because I feel like somewhere deep inside things will change.\nI recently moved in with him and his parents.

She's not very social, shy, not a drinker, has some self confidence issues so making friends is difficult for her and she doesn't really get out to often (high GPA masters student and researcher).

I had been looking for a job for about 3 months, after my old temporary contract ended. About 3 weeks ago, I got a call from a company for a backoffice administration opening. Got interviewed with about 12 other people in the same room. I was definitely the youngest one there. I should specify I have no college degree whatsoever. \n\nAnyway, I got through to the second round, passed the test with flying colours, and started the next day. I've been working there for 2 weeks now as an interim, as a testing period. Hopefully getting to sign a full on contract sometime this week. \n\nNow, when I started out, the work was repetitive and hard, but I'm already getting some responsibility. The location/office and co-workers are great. I thought this is it. But... During those 2 weeks I've been trained by a pretty cool guy who I had a lot in common with. He was more or less my mentor/mate. Last friday, he got the sack, even though he was sort of irreplaceable in my mind. He did a lot of stuff noone else there could, let alone me. It was only afterwards that I realised I was hired so they could kick him out. Yes, the boss is kind of a dick. I also heard afterwards that even though this is supposed to be a 9-5 job, it's more of a 9-... long, unpaid, overtime hours, 70h/week type of deal. I'm getting the feeling this company has a high turnover rate employee wise...\n\nI'm kinda scared shitless at the responsibilities they're preemptively trying to throw at me. Sometime this week, I'll have 'the talk' with my boss, and I'll be able to ask questions. What should I ask? How do I prepare myself? Any advice at all?\n\nMuch appreciated\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Opinion/advice needed on off-leash neighborhood dog\nPOST: Background: My lab, age 2, came into our lives at about 1.5. A breeder didn't want him anymore but things we have learned about him is that he probably didn't meet many other dogs (he overly sniffs, prefers attention of humans, heckles always raise instantly with other dogs but it goes away in a minute). So, he is still very \"new\" to greeting dogs. But, dog encounters, when he has them, are always friendly.\n\nFirst let me preface this by saying that the off-leash labrador in question is a very friendly one. She is older (probably around 7-8 years old, a rescue) and very compliant to the owner, but walks/jogs off leash around our suburban neighborhood. She typically is walking ahead of the owner, but will immediately stop and sit if the owner asks her to. \n\nWhen we do pass them every so often, she'll be trotting ahead of the owner and make her way towards us, face on. My lab will perk his ears up, furl his eyebrows (the same way he is when he's alert over a squirrel) and bark at her. They have greeted each other in the past, but she was dominating him (nothing aggressive) and we parted ways. I wanted him to calm down so I told the owner sorry, no greeting today. She sat and watched a barky Toby walk by.\nTL;DR:"}

I am sole heir to her estate (only child, father passed).  Before she died, she lent a friend of hers $35,000 to help keep his business afloat.  Before she passed we had the friend sign a promissory note stating the terms of repayment over time and that it would be paid to me.  In the last 15 months I have a stack of emails from him of failed promises and stories of tough times and not a single dime has been paid.  He keeps insisting his business is close to closing a \"big deal\" and he'll be able to pay the whole debt at once.  I am at my wits end and very frustrated because I don't know my options and I don't have money to just hire some California lawyer.  Through google I found a couple of lawyer firms in California that work on a contingency fee structure where they get paid when they collect, typically 40% of the amount.  But does anybody know if that's the best route?  They seem to still have about $1000 of small fees upfront for filing and such.

Should I throw in the towel?\nPOST: So this wonderful story begins about six weeks ago. I was a small group leader for orientation at my college and this beautiful girl happened to be in my group I was leading. We both took an interest in each other (unbeknownst to either of us at the time) but chose to not make a move to prevent things from being awkward. \n\nAbout 10 days pass and we see each other again during a day drinking holiday and we dance for a while before I work up the nerve to kiss her, what a fool I was. we spend the rest of the day partying with our friends before heading to her place where we have absolutely mind-blowing sex.\n\nFast-forward a few weeks, we've gone on a few dates and continue to have mind blowing sex. The problem sets in when other people are around. When it's just the two of us she's prone to kissing, holding hands, all the lovey dovey shit which I love. Throw other people into the mix however, and that stops instantly, to the point where I'm fighting just to grab her attention\n\nAbout a week ago I confronted her about how I couldn't handle this dichotomy she kept up. What came next was a bit unexpected: I learned of her woes with past partners and how it colored her view of relationships. It also didn't help that I had recently brought up the idea of a committed relationship, which was met with a less than favorable response. Despite the above, we decided to keep talking but toned it down a lot. As it stands right now we are no longer sleeping with each other, yet neither of us are seeing other people. \n\nWhat confuses me the most is that she has told me on several occasions how I am the best guy she has been with both on a romantic and sexual level blah blah blah, and yet she's unwilling to take the plunge, somehow content with this half-assed, non-committal thing we have. Suffice to say, I am not happy with this, at all. I don't want this to stop, but I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

Luckily, I've kept my nose to the grindstone and have two job offers at the moment. Here's what I'm working with right now, and what's factoring into my decision:\n\n1st Job: Call center representative for a large company in the US, working as a technical support representative. The base pay I've negotiated is at $24k per year. There's also a good benefits package, which includes a tuition reimbursement (I'm going to be attending online classes during spring of 2014). From what I understand, there's a lot of room for advancement with the company, particularly for those who excel at hitting the goals set by management. \n\n2nd Job: Located in Seattle, WA. Entry level position in a consulting firm, starting pay is $38k. I haven't been given any details about the specifics of benefits, but from what I've looked at (Glassdoor, other employee-based review sites) it's par for similar jobs in the industry. I've been told that I would probably be in this position for roughly 1.5 to 2 years before having a chance to advance within the company. However, being in a larger city presents a possibility of being able to network and be in an area with more job opportunities. \n\nI'd be more comfortable taking the first job, since I'd have a lower cost of living (although a lower salary) and would have guaranteed tuition assistance. Additionally, I'll admit that I don't have enough saved up for a move to a larger city right now and I have some credit card debt to pay down.\nTL;DR:"}

Well surprise! Nearly every women I've met and gotten to know throughout my 3 years as a college student were all in a relationship. Those that weren't were pretty much old enough to be my mom (or grandmother in some cases), or weren't interested in men at all.\n\nI'm a 21 year old Male, and so far, this has been driving me crazy! Even now, when I transferred to another university, it's practically the same! \n\nIt's stupid, but I feel as if every girl on campus has a BF, so it's gotten to the point I don't even want to try anymore because I'm 99% sure that the next girl won't be any different! I pretty much had shitty self-esteem, but this has been making it even shittier (especially around women)...\n\nJust to clarify: no I do not approach women and immediately start hitting on them and asking if they're single (I'm not a creeper lol). Basically, once I meet or get to know a girl, I typically find out that they're in a relationship sooner or later. They either bring it up, show me pictures of their recent date or get together, or talk about their crappy relationship status. I also doubt that they're lying because I don't think I'm unattractive or socially awkward enough. Sure I'm shy, but a lot of girls I've met thought it was kinda cute... Hell, I'm sure that some of the girls were legitly interested in me, but I pretty much broke all contact with them because I don't think it's right ruining their relationship, you know?\nTL;DR:"}

We're both attending the same college (where we met) and grew close before mutually deciding to bang in our spare time (without any obligations to each other).\n\nA little bit ago (about two months), he--let's call him Mark--told me that he might pursue another girl and so he wanted to stop the on-the-side screwing. He only said this because a girl had come up and declared her interest in him, and he felt it wasn't right to be dallying with two girls at once. Two days later, Mark changed his mind and we've been back to fwb since.\n\nBesides that incident, Mark has not once actually expressed interest in anybody else. More than that, because we were and continue to be such good friends, I feel like he acts more like a boyfriend than a fwb. In fact, I'd really like to call him my boyfriend--he is essentially filling the role in everything but the name. The problem is, I think the idea of cementing our relationship status makes him a little leery (Mark's had some weird experiences with chicks in the past). Even more than that, I'm still not sure whether or not he wants the pressure of having me as a \"girlfriend.\" I think that he puts a lot of unnecessary negative weight on the term (ie I would expect more of him, repeat his negative experiences, etc.).\n\nThat being said, I really like him and I want to give this a genuine shot. Should I just leave it as is and hope he comes to me/things develop on their own, especially since he's very shy about it? Or should I take an initiative and somehow open that line of communication now?\nTL;DR:"}

Anyway, during the day she's awesome.\n\nThere is just one thing that's been annoying the hell out of me lately and that's the fact that her highness doesn't care for the living room door being closed in the morning. We keep her and another cat in the living room (+litterboxes) during the night, because otherwise they'll often tear around the (2 bedroom) apartment which isn't quite compatible with trying to get some sleep. \n\nThis means she's scratching/clawing at the living room door at 5:00, 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning, and she'll easily go at it for 30 mins straight, which in turn means -I- am awake at 5, 6 or 7 in the morning, every day, because I sleep lightly and the apartment isn't that big so the noise carries into the bedroom.\n\nWe've tried a few things, like repremanding her by squirting water at her or having the vacuumcleaner (which she hates) in the living room and activating it from the bedroom (the apartment is small enough :)) when she scratches to try and create a negative association with scratching at the door. While the vacuumcleaner helps for the moment, it isn't a fix: she'll do it again the next morning, and the next morning, etc.\n\nSo my question for you, cattit:\n\nDo you know of any tricks I could try and get her to stop scratching the door in the morning?\nTL;DR:"}

We are both in our first serious relationship.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are fairly social people; We have friends over to our apartment regularly. Many times at least one person stay the night. On weeknights I must wake up early, as I leave for work before 6 a.m. Her schooling and work are begin several hours later my job (9am-11am; depending on the day).\n\nThis means that she is regularly alone with several hours with whoever stayed the pervious night. This is where my problem begins.\n\nMost of our shared friends are men, some closer to her age and others older than me. She hangsout with these men for hours while I'm away regularly. She has gone on road trips and smoking sessions which I only find out about weeks later. She seems to not lie to me but avoid talking about her day in detail with me.\n\nShe and I, as well as our friends, are devout members of the drug culture. Using hard drugs recreationally is not strange for us, and is more of the norm. It has recently come to light that she extchanges car rides for cocaine, ecstacy, and whichever drug our friends happen to have.\n\nI am left in the dark almost always it appears. I have only discovered a handfull of occasions where this has happened, however, it is always weeks or even months afterwards. I am positive that there must be other occasions as she sees these people more than twice a week without me.\n\nI am not certain if she is involved romantically with any of there people, I do have doubt sometimes.

I recently saw him and we were constantly battling because I was late getting back from a work meeting and changed some plans (but he was still a part of the plans) while I was in town, to see old friends I hadn't seen in a while. It was 2 days of him yelling at me and he told me he wanted a divorce. We ended up talking it out and making up.\n\nFast forward to now and we are okay - he says he constantly misses me. Today, I get a message online saying he is going out for dinner and a movie with his ex. I tell him thank you for letting me know and I don't hear back for hours even after messaging him to ask how the movie was. Then he comes online and says they were too stuffed and ended up watching a movie at her place and his notifications must have been off. I have been through this before, at least 4 or 5 times where I've completely melted down because of his lack of communication when he is out with his ex. The last time was 2 days before our wedding and I was out for my bachelorette party - we were texting and it was late and he said his ex was over at his house helping him get ready for the wedding, he failed to let me know beforehand. She was also in his wedding party, for full disclosure. I know I should probably be okay that they are friends but after spending 2 days being yelled at for wanting to see my friends while I was on my trip, he goes and pulls this really sketchy thing.

Bit of background: I go to a college that has a pretty well established career center but by no means is the golden key to a good career. During the summers I find a job through them related to my field so that I can get a head start. She goes to a different college but they of course still have some kind of counselors for career guidance and finding work opportunities. \n\nAnyway I see that it gets her very down sometimes when she sees her peers having success and she isn't. Whenever I try to talk to her about it she always has a pretty pessimistic attitude about it i.e. nobody in her field will ever hire her because she has no experience or when I tell her to talk to a career counselor at her school she assumes they won't have anything to offer her. There's always some excuse. \n\nRecently she managed to find a job through one of her family friends that requires her to take an online course and get a license to actually do the job. The friend who hired her (her boss) told her it would only take about a week or two to finish. And now over a month later she's barely made any progress. I asked her why and she said it was because it was a hard and boring course, but the only thing I hear out of that is that she's being lazy. If not for this job she wouldn't do much more than sit around and watch Netflix for the summer. \n\nI care about her and want her future to be good but she always seems to be dragging her feet or making excuses.

The first time, I remember thinking to myself, \"what are the odds this is a cute Fed Ex guy?\" so I pulled up next to him, glance over, and low and behold, he was very attractive. We exchanged glances and smiles. I drove slow and fast to keep up with him, but then my exit came along, I gave him one last cute smile and got of the exit. Today, I saw a truck coming up behind me and I thought to myself \"what are the odds it's him??\" Well guess what, it was. And he remembered me, we did some more glancing flirty smiles to each other and then I lost him because my lane slowed way the heck down. Just before I was about to get off my exit, I finally caught up to him again(and he definitely slowed way down so that I could catch up to him, knowing which exit I was about to get off of), I looked over to give one last smile and he smiled and blew a kiss at me. This sounds so silly and childish but it was adorable and fun! The chances of me seeing him again are probably pretty good since he's probably done with his route and headed back to the warehouse to drop off the truck, and I go that way everyday at the same time. So Reddit, how can I have some fun with this guy the next time I see him??

I had my mid-year review with her a couple weeks after that so I figured I would get it after that was done.

So I've been waiting for a random email again just like that one, but I'm kind of losing hope. The company is going through a lot of changes right now, all seemingly positive.

Since then I have been on dates with two other girls and now I am in a relationship of three months with a girl who is the same age as me.\n\nIt's been going fine so far, but there is something missing and I just can't quite put my finger on it. It's driving me insane. My current girlfriend is nicer, more thoughtful and more physically attractive than my previous girlfriend and yet something isn't right. It's difficult to describe...but there is something that is still...a little awkward. You can see it in the way we text, the way we greet each other and the way we say goodbye. I find myself wondering if I am doing the right thing or if I should break up with her.\n\nPart of me thinks it is because I am comparing things to my previous relationship, when everything was new and exciting and the girl I dated was totally different (far more forward and experienced, she basically taught me everything about sex). Everything was also perfectly timed, it was the summer holidays so we got to see each other so often, whereas with my new girlfriend it's only on weekends.\n\nI find myself sitting and staring at my wall for hours on end attempting to figure out what isn't right between me and this new girl. The thing is, I feel like I can't really dump her for various reasons. Firstly, I am her first boyfriend and I don't want to mess things up for her so she has a bad memory of her first relationship. Secondly, I might regret it and it might just be that the relationship needs a bit more time.\n\nAny advice, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, how do you improve the ability to focus on things for which you have no interest?\nPOST: Hey reddit... just a background to perhaps explain my predicament better.\n\nI'm a very intelligent person. Standardized test, IQ tests etc I routinely score in the top couple percentile without any preparation.\n\nWhen I come across a task I'm interested in, I can focus on it for days with only interruptions being food and sleep. I'll exceed any expectations and do extraordinarily well. \n\nBut, on the exact opposite. If I don't have a strong interest in something, I have no hope. I fade off nearly instantly. I'm talking a half way through the first paragraph of a chapter in a textbook and I'm completely gone. It takes me all day to do a short essay that a below average person would do in an hour or so. \n\nAnd it's pretty severely holding me back in work and school. I'm 4.5 years into college and college has yet to challenge me in any way other then attention span. If I were capable of getting myself to focus, I could have graduated two years ago. But I absolutely can't.\n\nI'm not sure how much of my attention problem is placebic (that is, I believe that I can't focus so my already low ability to focus is lowered to meet my increasingly lowering expectations...) and how much of it is reality. To add, I also have pretty bad short term memory and, I guess, ADD. I've never had the hyperactivity proponent; quite the contrary. As a kid I would sit and play with ONE toy for as long as I was allowed to play. And I'm still that way. One task that I find interesting completely employs me for as much time as I have to spend. \n\nSo...blah blah blah... I'd rather not resort to adderal or similar drugs; I've read too much bad about them to want to try it out. So what else do you guys do to aid yourselves if you have this problem?\nTL;DR:"}

He doesn't even try to hold back, he farts maybe 10 times a day and it sounds like he is shitting his pants (no, he does not have a medical issue). Just the most explosive, nasty shit ever. I hate it!! Most of the time he farts like this, he is naked as well, in our bed, on the couch, farting away. I've asked him a thousand times to be more respectful around me. Like I understand you're a man and you're \"comfortable\" in the relationship but what the fuck I don't want to spend my life smelling your farts you can't even ATTEMPT to be courtious or at least put on some boxers....anyways, he farts just to spite me sometimes, which is what really pisses me off, and then he smiles and he's like \"what?\" I'm just like, can you please stop? And he's like, well I live here, you're my gf, I'm comfortable, blah blah blah. It just makes me feel so disrespected!! Also he shits, and it can stink, like alll other humans. So I bought Glade and put it right on top of the toilet, and I told him about buying it so he KNEW. 5 months later he hasn't used it once!!! I'm so tired of him being gross on purpose and not even attempting to like, cover up his stink, or making his farts less loud, or at least putting on boxers when he farts so its less gross. He's even farted on my leg, BOTH OF US NAKED, tried to give me dutch ovens, and laughed I'm so irritated. Is there anything I can do to make him stop?! I have asked him a thousand times and even gotten a little snippy but nothing seems to work.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for 2,5 years now. We love each other, I have never had a more stable and nurturing relationship and I love spending every minute with her. But the sex was never really *too exciting*. When we started dating she told me she didn't have much experience and has only been with a couple of guys. She never takes initiative, even if she badly wants me it's always up to me to start. That isn't a big problem but it's part of a bigger issue. She's just very lazy when it comes to sex. Most of the time she just sort of lays down and expects me to do all the work. We've talked about it and it obviously was news to her that she has to do any work at all. We've talked numerous times but with very little results. We've had oral just once, because I practically had the bluest of balls after 5 days her having menstruation. Even if I try to show her what I would like to see, get her on top, after a minute she's exhausted and annoyed.\n\nLately I've been fighting attacks from my subconscious with thoughts of sex my ex. We kind of grew up sexually together. We first dated back when we were 16 and took each other's virginity. Three years later we had a very sex-oriented relationship for a year, and two years after that we tried a new relationship before we decided to stop because it obviously wasn't going anywhere but the sex was a chemistry master piece so it ended up in a hurtful on-off thing. After that I met my current girlfriend and fell in love. I do not want to be cynical but sex with her is like two grannies playing ping pong compared to the Olympics I had with my ex.\n\nI'm very confused right now. I'm overwhelmed by thoughts of cheating on my girlfriend.. but it's only sexual. Emotionally that thought is killing me. So I'm searching for advice. Are there any ways I could change my girlfriend's lazy habits? Is there anyway to make her reveal some more potential?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [20M] best friend [19M] of 5 years, and his girlfriend of nearly 2 years [23F] have an unhealthy relationship. Worried about him\nPOST: Hi, this isn't really about me but about my close friend who I know and love like a brother. Shortly after his 18th birthday he began dating someone online, from Washington state (we're on the east coast). Previously he had been talking online with this girl before he turned 18, and I talked with her a few times and she seemed nice enough.\n\nHowever, they're coming up on two years at this point and I'm really worried about him. Before they were dating we would always hang out and play football/watch television/play video games, typical friend stuff. But now he is completely at her beck and call, one text from her and he'll ditch everyone. Sometimes I don't see him for days at a time because he's waiting on her online.\n\nI feel I should take a break to note that he has never met her in person. They FaceTime and text, but don't actually meet up.\n\nBut what I think is the worst is his mood. He's always had depression, I helped convince him to get help in the first place. But ever since he's started dating her his mood seems to be worse than usual. Worse than that, whenever he's feeling down she gets really weird, saying that he's not responding to her (due to the fact he's sleeping for 18 hours due to aforementioned depression) and she thinks he hates her now. She also has to point out how depressed SHE is whenever he tries to talk about his depression, and generally tries to make the conversation about her.\n\nI'm really worried that he's in over his head here. She is the first person he's ever dated so I'm not sure if he knows what is ok or not in a relationship. But I'm also worried about saying anything, because I know she'll try to make me out to be the bad guy and have him cut all ties with me, which I don't want since he's like my little brother.

I haven't got much experience with dating, usually I'm the casual sex type so pardon me if I come across a little naive. \n\nI met this guy a couple months ago through a mutual friend of ours, we hit it off for a night but didn't talk again til a few weeks later when our mutual friend told me he fancied me. So he messaged me his number and I text him, we chat for a while, snapchat, etc. and after about a week of that wind up having sex (admittedly while a bit drunk.)

I leave mid afternoon the next day, and I have only heard from him once briefly in the last week.

My step-dad suggested we (him, myself, and my two younger brothers) all pitch in money to purchase a 5th generation Ipod Touch for my mother for christmas. All of us except Dale (step-dad) had our share of money allocated. Well after he inquired about the progress of our purchase I told him that we were waiting for him to give his share of money to me so I can go buy the ipod. In response to this he told me it was my fault and that I was, and I quote \"A lazy piece of fucking shit\". I had to cash all of my checks from work and had to compile all of our (middle brother and I) money to hurry to Walmart and buy the ipod in time for christmas day.\n\nJust this afternoon he tried to pay us (middle brother and I) back for the share he said he would provide. I refused because I didn't want his money. I did this purely out of spite but I still wanted an explanation as to why it was my fault he didn't take care of his responsibility. He walked out the door to go to the outer shed behind our house something along the lines of being level headed. After about 10 seconds he threw the door back open, stormed across the room, and began to hurl obscenities towards me. I never once raised my voice but he never lowered his. At some point things came to a head and he grabbed my throat (for reference I am 5'11\" 150 lbs, he is 6'3\" 230 lbs) pulled me out of the chair I was sitting in and threatened to break my neck. I almost told him to do it but calmer heads prevailed. \n\nHe laid down some ultimatums for me to achieve before the end of the month or there may be a 4th incident. For those of you that read this I thank you for listening to my rant I had to talk to someone though.\nTL;DR:"}

I have almost 0 dating/sexual experience and have been ardent to begin dating for the first time in my life. \n\nDuring my early teens I suffered from major depression, social anxiety, and substance abuse issues. I spent the better part of a decade doing little but playing video games, getting high, and feeling sorry for myself. Several years ago I managed to overcome my depression and get sober. Since then I have worked tirelessly to do exceptionally well in college after barely graduating from high school. My work has paid off and I now have a decent paying job and am attending a prestigious university. My initial aim, when I started getting my life together, was to study and work for the majority of my 20s and worry about finding a girlfriend after graduating and landing a high paying job. Things were going according to plan until transferring to my current uni where I have more in common with my classmates. \n\nBefore it was incredibly easy to focus on nothing but my work, but now that I am surrounding by beautiful, intelligent women I find it increasingly difficult to ignore the longing I have for companionship. My major obstacle is the status I have at work and school. My schoolmates and coworkers assume I have a very active social and love life. I'm very intelligent, well-spoken, attractive, funny and empathetic (Despite sounding like an arrogant bastard just now). \n\nWhen girls from school show interest I always withdraw, fearful of damaging the reputation I have worked so hard over the years to build (I know this sounds narcissistic but I was brutally teased in high school by my drinking buddies because I was the only one not dating or hooking up with girls). Dating sites seemed ideal, as I can meet people who don't know anyone I regularly interact with, but I am too paranoid to use a picture of myself. Frequenting bars would probably be beneficial, but my previous issues with drugs and alcohol make this a last resort. \n\nSo now I come to you Reddit for advice.\nTL;DR:"}

She told me she wasn't ready yet so I waited patiently to let her come to terms with things. This last week she sent me a couple of messages on fb asking how things were going and we talked for a bit. When I mentioned going to grab some tea and catch up she told me she was really busy and didn't have time. We started getting into some more personal questions about life and I told her I would rather just talk about it in person and her response was 'We'll see' \n\nI'm unsure what to think here and how to go about being friends. To be honest I was pretty insulted when she said she was too busy to hang out with me and catch up, yet was fine with asking me questions over fb. I know she's busy, but I really got the feeling that she just didn't think going for tea with me for a few hours was worth her time.

So seems perfect right? *Not exactly*\n\n**Dilema**: I got the Cintas internship through a program called INROADS. Basically, they take your resume, spruce it up, and send it to companies; usually guaranteeing an interview at the very least. Most of the time if you're good with interviews you have the job. You also get a job offer like 90% of the time with the company you interned with. If I go to GD, I have to leave INROADS. GD will look great on my resume and *maybe* lead to a job offer after graduation. Cintas will definitely lead to a job offer, and other possible offers through INROADS (i.e. JcPenny, Aldi, Target). All of the companies I have mentioned has a high chance of leading to a 6-figure job in a few years, except Cintas.

I don't know which ones, but I know he was dealing them too, and went to rehab at some point. He still drank somewhat even though he's an alcoholic, but he got a steady job, an apartment, and generally seemed to be doing OK.\n\nHe's also a misogynist. This is relevant because he's previously had problems with girlfriends. Within the last year, one girlfriend filed a restraining order against him as he was stalking her and tapping her phone calls, and the most recent girlfriend - whom he impregnated after knowing her for 3 months - left him after his paranoia became too much to handle.\n\nSince the most recent girlfriend left, everything's gone downhill. He lost his job, lost his health insurance, lost money on the apartment they'd moved into together as he had to move out, lost money on lawyer fees, etc. He thinks the girl who left him put a hidden tracking device in his car, is planning to have her friends ambush and attack him, that she may have implanted listening devices, etc. Essentially, he's lost it.\n\nMy family has different ideas on how to handle this. We just recently got drug test results that show he has been on meth for at least 2 months, which means he was taking it when he was still with his last girlfriend. \n\nWe need to be very careful as he is in a delicate place.

It's really nice to be in the same room together because we have a lot of diverse hobbies and are busy college students. Thing is my boyfriend has the habit of falling asleep in his chair. I don't mind when he is just napping. Or if it's accidental. The issue is that I will wake him up and let him know he has fallen asleep in the office and he gets irritated, and just wants to be left alone. He'll sleep all day, or never go to bed, if I never say anything, and then gets upset about lost time, or back/neck pain. Nothing I do, or say convinces him to do anything but sit their and sleep. And it's makes me frustrated and mad. I feel like he's hurting himself and damaging his quality of life, and I can't just let it go. I feel stupid that something like this is getting in the way of my love for him, but I feel terribly resentful, and that he doesn't care about how his actions make me feel, nor the damage he doing to himself allowing this issue to persist. Just talking about it has me irritated all over again. It's just been an ongoing issue and when I try to talk about it it goes no where and all the blame is on me for being irritated about it, despite how he talks to me when I remind him he needs to get up early ect..\nWhat can I do? I'm sure I am in the wrong. But I just cannot let go of the feeling that he's hurting himself with this behavior. :(\nTL;DR:"}

NSFW-ish.\nPOST: Me and my girlfriend are currently in our freshman year of college, with both of us being from out of state, with the two of us being from two different states (about a 2.5 hour drive away from one another). As such, we are going to start having a long distance relationship over this summer (which for once is not the source of the relationship problems). The two of us were very close friends for almost the entire school year before we began our relationship. As such, I feel like we are great friends, which is awesome and my favorite part of our relationship. It does however raise a problem.\n\nMy girlfriend, to put it lightly, has no sexual drive. I have often teased her for being asexual and that she will not admit it. She has even, to her own admission, never masturbated. She is totally naive on all matters sexual, and cannot even grasp the most obvious of innuendos. As such, we have a great romantic relationship, but absolutely nothing going on sexually. I would honestly not be surprised if she has never thought about me in a sexual manner.\n\nNow, I know I sound like I'm being a typical teenage hornball, but I do think that it's important to have a sexual side to our relationship; I feel like she does not trust me enough to allow herself to think of us being sexual. I want to have a sexual AND romantic relationship with her, but just can't think of any easy way to say so. Especially with us not being able to see each other until September, I want to make the time we see each other this summer special, without feeling like I am forcing her to do anything that she does not want to do.

When we're together things are really good.  We'll do supper/shows/coffee/whatever twice a week, and I'll often sleep over.  Sex is great, conversation is fantastic (like, stay up till 5am talking); in person everything is enjoyable.  \n\nHowever, when we're not together he seems pretty disinterested.  Very little communication, and I'm often the one setting up the next date (though he usually pays/hosts).  He's still (frequently) on the dating website we met on.  Usually by this point guys have asked me to be exlusive/GF and are very communicative...\n\nI've also realized that while we have sex with condoms on, some of our play could easily transfer STIs, and I don't want to put myself at that risk if he's seeing other people.\n\nEven though he feels kind of uninterested/distant when we're not together, I'm at the point where I'd like to be exclusive (not BF/GF yet) or move along.  We have an afternoon date this weekend and I think then would be a good time to ask, but what is the most casual/non-confrontational way to ask? I know how I ask won't change anything, but I'm worried about coming on too strong/serious.  Particularly if he says no! \n\nOn a side note, it's strange that it's (only) an afternoon date, and I'd assume he were dumping me if he didn't seem so enthusiastic.   Usually our plans go beyond an afternoon. So I also have a slight fear of mentioning exclusivity right before he ends things!  \n\nSome potential ways I've been thinking about asking are asking if he's seeing anyone else, mention it in the context of sexual safety, ask him how he feels about me, ask him about exclusivity without my own feelings, or mentioning my own feelings without asking about exclusivity... I have too many scenarios going through my head!\nTL;DR:"}

Sister lives with her mom and they have no money to help him get better. I was wondering if Reddit could help me to help the sister with advice, recommendations on free/very cheap animal clinics in the Southeast US, to consider possible diagnoses (because narrowing down what could be wrong with the dog would save a ton of money at the vet on tests and other pointless exams that tack on extra charges), or possible options for treatment that might help the dog... Really, any advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nOf course they could always take the dog to the pound and see what they could do but after contacting local shelters, they said there was very little, if anything they could do aside from putting him down. I'd like to give the dog a chance and thought it wouldn't hurt to ask Reddit as one of our last resources. \n\nSome information about the dog: \n\n* Breed: Siberian Husky\n* Gender: Male\n* Not Neutered\n* Age: 9yrs\n* Lives outdoors with shelter in fenced in yard\n* He had all his puppy shots and last shot was a 3yr rabies shot that expires this year\n* Medical History: He was injured attempting to jump a fence in 2008 creating an unseen wound on his chest which turned into an abscess that was vet-treated and cleared as fully healed 6 mos later. Other than that, healthy until about 8 mos ago when my sister suspected he might be having seizures. The dog has also come in contact with several feral cats (as he hunts any wild game that enters his \"territory\"). \n* Recently upon examination, my sister noticed a large open sore on the dog's bottom (under his tail) and she's very worried about the way it looks. This is suspected to be the root of all of the dogs discomfort. In case there are any Veterinarians on here, maybe you can help? Any advice would be appreciated. Obviously it would be best to take him to the vet to be examined but as mentioned, the sister and her mom are struggling financially as there have been recent deaths in the family and they would like to try everything before having to give the dog up or put him down.

Confused and lost.\nPOST: I am not really looking for advice or anything like that. I just wanted to get this off my chest and ask if anyone else has had a similar experience. \n\nRecently my girlfriend and I split after about a year of dating. Our relationship was very good. We had a ton of fun, rarely argued and never fought. About two weeks ago I dropped her off at home and noticed she was a bit distant, I asked her if something was bothering her. She told me that she felt like she needed to be single. She is in love with me but felt that she was only happy when we were together, when she got home or if we didn't see each other that day she felt lost. She said she needed to find herself as a person, she needed to be happy with herself before she could be happy with someone. \n\nSome back story here, I was there when she broke up with her previous boyfriend, consoling her and whatnot. We have known each other for years. Things escalated between me and her and shortly after we were dating. We both knew that she needed time to be single however we made the mistake of not giving it to her. \n\nCurrently, she says she isn't looking to date anyone, and doesn't know when she will be ready to date again. She didn't want to rule out us ever dating again but we both know that we cant wait for each other. If we are in the same points in our lives some time down the road maybe we will get another chance. Its a difficult situation for both of us, and it has completely devastated me. I miss her more than I ever imagined. I have had longer relationships and I've had shorter ones, but this break up has hurt more than any other. It confuses me that two people can be so in love and yet it still may not work out. \n\nI respect her for being strong enough to go through with the breakup knowing how she felt about me. I hope she finds what she needs. This is just another testament to the awesome power of a human connection. The greater it is the more it will hurt, but it makes you feel alive. \n\nApologies for all the disjointed thoughts. Thanks for reading.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [17 F] friend is mad at Me [17 F] because a Boy [18 M] likes me, not her.\nPOST: Alright, so this is going on currently. My friend last year began talking to this boy in the grade above us. They talked for around a year and she began to really like him. During this time, I was also talking to him and we became really good friends. She began getting really jealous that he would talk to me. Eventually, she was saying very weird things to him and being really rude, so he decided to end things and I guess essentially \"break up\" with her. (They were never dating.)\n\nNow, around 6 months later, I still talk to this boy, and recently we began to bring our relationship to the next level. I obviously told my friend, because I did not want to keep it a secret from her. She was extremely angry. I had a long conversation with her about how I understand that she is mad, but I do not think she should end our friendship over this. We have been friends for 7 years, and are only in high school right now. They never actually dated, and he never actually liked her, but she blames me for stealing him from her. I personally think she is overreacting, but I feel really bad and don't know what to do. :(\nTL;DR:"}

He doesn't drive recklessly, as in i'm never that concerned for our safety or others on the road, but he enjoys driving quickly through traffic, he says it gives him a rush. \n\nI have no lack of confidence in his driving, he used to rally race and go to drift events all the time, but he recently got a sports car I don't know the name of but it's some model of porsche and he's been driving it non-stop since he got it for his birthday. I'm happy he's enjoying himself but i'm worried he could get into an accident and I've refused to get in the car with him after that first ride when I actually feared for my life. He told me I should be happy because at least now his car is made to go fast and has high safety standards but I'm not convinced. \n\nAm I being irrational wanting him to get rid of it? Should I just tell him I want him to sell the car because I'm uncomfortable with it? We've been together a fair amount of time and I want him to be around for a long time but I don't want him to resent me for asking him to do something like that.\nTL;DR:"}

I'd known her for a few years through other friends and we clicked fairly well. \n\nEventually she came to me when she was feeling depressed and having had similar experiences was there for her. I really liked talking to her and she helped me through a lotta my shit. We were in all the same classes bar two. She usually didn't sit with me in class or outside of class because her friends group would probably think it is strange she's talking to the very awkward, tall, pale, skinny kid with a stutter. \n\nWe'd talk a lot via social media and texting and we met up outside of school to just chill and go to movies etc. Her friend kind of noticed it after a while and was kinda odd about it. We're completely different sides of the social spectrum. I'm shy and keep to myself, whereas she has a lotta friends and cocks lining up for her if she wants them.\n\nHere is where it goes to shit. Its a late night (cliche) and we're texting. I finally open up and tell her I liked her and possibly wanted to be closer. She doesn't feel the same way, and it all tumbles down. See, I thought she had liked me the same way for a while based off a lot of the things she'd do around me and talk to me and snapchat/text/etc. \n\nI'd like to point out now that I don't think the friend zone exists. If you like someone but they don't like you the same way, you can't change their opinion of you. The problem here is our friendship went right out the window and we don't talk much now.\nTL;DR:"}

It became increasingly difficult for both of us to stay away from each other and we started having sex again after a few weeks. This was probably the best sex I've ever had with her and it seems that it was mutual, most likely because the feeling of not being together made it so. Another month or so went by and I ended up hooking up with a girl I met at a bar and I completely regret it. I felt so awful that I told her as soon as I could so she didn't hear it from someone else and she has been so broken up about it ever since. I feel so guilty and awful about it because it's not who I am and I'm still in love with my ex and I have really been feeling like she is starting to pull away from me. I don't want to lose her.\n\nI'm asking if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and what can I do to get her back? Is it just going to take time to heal the wounds, or can I take other steps?\nTL;DR:"}

My parents and their church group have sponsored a family to come to our northern Alberta town.  They've been here a few months and are starting to fit in as much as can be expected.  They're not able to work currently (learning english as this is a predominantly english speaking town)  so I think Xmas might be a little tight.\n\nThey didn't come with much and I'd like to help out a little: they have enough for the basics and a little bit of extras (cable and internet on donated hardware) so this should be something nice I guess. While practical is, well, practical, I know what it's like to get a gift that's not practical when money is tight.\n\nThey have a 15 year old son who's learning English a little quicker than his parents. I don't know a ton about the family yet so I couldn't give any interests to start with: I suppose the 15 year old has the same interests any 15 year old has; I'm just too old to remember anything but porn and booze at that age.\n\nI'm not sure how much I want to spend; I have a decent job, so does my wife and we just finished paying off all the credit cards this month. I'm thinking 200-300 total? Maybe less? I could see spending more if it was something that really would make a difference.\n\nSo Reddit I'm not asking for donations, or atheism/Christianity competitiveness; just being a decent human being: what do I get a family that doesn't have a ton for Xmas?\nTL;DR:"}

Now I have a marketing degree but you take a ton of management courses with that degree so as a 22 year old I considered myself am expert.  When I went to directly managing three departments and 40 people I learned a lot. Fast forward 2 years and they moved me back home and put me over marketing for the entire company(11 stores).  Then we started a service company and they needed someone to be the sys admin for their new 1/4 of a million dollar software.  So at that point in 2011 I made the move into the IT world.

I was told they were cutting my salary 18k a year putting me back where I started.  So now I am looking to get out of this company and start a new path.

As I said it's mainly 1, but sometimes another joins in, etc... \n\nNow, I'd say I have moderately thick skin (sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), basically I can take shit from someone, but after about 3 years of it building up it's killing me from the inside and it's getting to a point where I can't stand it. A little extra information, my mum some times teases me about being overweight as well (I don't think she realizes it actually hurts me, but whatever), my brother will call me fat at every opportunity he has.\n\nI just want some advice on how to go about this situation, I hate going out, meeting people, making friends and stuff because of this. I know I need a lot of weight, and I'm trying but it's really not that simple for me.\nTL;DR:"}

We're both 30. I am absolutely TERRIBLE at thinking of good gifts for people.  I tried to get him to agree to not doing gifts since neither of us really celebrate Christmas, but he got really sad about it and apparently has now gotten me something anyway in spite of that conversation (no idea what it is yet).\n\nI have absolutely no idea what to get him.  I've spent forever browsing the internet for ideas, have asked other people who know him for ideas, and I've been thinking about this for over a month and now it's getting down to crunch time.  He is one of those people who is satisfied with everything and doesn't have much of a need for material things.  He lives simply and never talks about wishing he had anything.  But, he is really wonderful and I want to do something thoughtful/special that will make him feel appreciated. \n\nHe gets me nice and thoughtful things even though he doesn't need to do so, and then somehow it makes me feel inadequate like I can't ever think of anything as perfect to get or do because I have this terrible inability to think of good gifts. It's like all of this pressure to think of a \"great gift\" is making me completely draw a blank.  Also, I'm unsure of how much is a \"normal\" amount to spend on someone  you've been with for 8 months.  I don't want to be cheap, but I'm also not exactly rich.\n\nObviously without knowing him you probably can't offer really specific gift suggestions... but what do I do in this situation? How can I come up with something?  Are any of you perfectly content want/need nothing kind of guys who could mention what kind of gift would make you happy?\n\nI know this seems like a really trivial problem but I can't believe how much I'm starting to obsess/freak out over this :(\nTL;DR:"}

I haven't seen every alien movie, so it's possible I could be heading to a trap.\n\nOf course I would carry some weapons with me.  By this time people have gone nuts and its become a free for all in all department stores.  I would pick up only small arms to keep myself light on my feet.

We discussed it at length and it still affects me today. \n\nToday, my boyfriend let me use his old SD card from his phone. I know I invaded his privacy when I did this, but I used a recovery program to recover the old deleted pictures from it. I found many pictures of girl's butts in his classes as well as pictures of my best friend's chest with me sitting right next to her. The phone was zoomed in on HER chest, with my arms in the foreground, as I was playing piano. Some others were videos of girls butts as they were standing and some as they were sitting, doing assignments. \n\nMonths before this occurrence, we had discussed this issue and he had told me he never did any of that stuff. (the stuff being porn, looking at other girls). Me being 'in love' put all my blind faith in him. \n\nHe admitting to using some of them to masturbate. He also admits he was being purposefully deceitful when he took the images. I admire him for telling the truth but what he did wasn't right. I expected him to stealthily look at other girls, as that is classier and I wouldn't have known the difference, but knowing he likes them enough to take pictures and use hurts immensely. \n\nAlso in there were unsuspecting pictures of me mixed in with the other girls. This scares me as he could have rape tendencies. I am afraid of what he is capable of.\n\nI am not hurt at the fact he looked at other girls and found them attractive as that is human nature. However, him lying to me does hurt as all I ask for in a relationship is honesty. Now I feel awkward around my friend.\n\nHelp would be much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

It smelled and tasted horrible, but I decided to tough it out and swallow because I thought that that's just how some oysters are (I rarely have them).

I immediately threw it away, and after that my friend and I googled bad oysters and the effects they can have on your body when eaten.  Through some reading we discovered that a pretty dangerous bacteria can infect you by eating bad oysters. Thinking that it would help reduce my risk of infection, I decided to try to vomit out everything I ate, so I found a washroom and did exactly that. My question now is, does anybody know if this actually helped me? or am I doomed to be infected and possibly die....\n\nThis is what I read my info from:\n\nI know it says raw oysters, but this was the best thing my friend could find.

I was even accused of attempting to manipulate her due to miscommunication (I initially reached out for the first three days after the breakup, emotionally charged and lacking tactfulness: no surprise).

She even tried to make me jealous after a certain point by saying she didn't even wait 12 hours after the split to fuck someone else, which I suspected. But through all of it, I was able to keep calm and remain collected...and honestly? I've never felt so empowered. It only made her angrier and try harder to knock me down or get more explicit about the things she had done since \"moving on\" these past two weeks. In a way, I feel like the bigger person for being able to admit my fault in everything that went down, in spite of all the ill-will being thrown my way. But at the same time...I'm sad that I'm responsible for all of that harbored hate and denial. It was bad enough to the point where she claimed never having been happy in the relationship.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [23/f] Am I right to feel worried about my boyfriends [29/m] masturbation habits?\nPOST: I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year and a half. We are pretty compatible, and moved in together a few months back.  He hasn't had a job since July, and I was recently laid off so we have been spending a lot of time together during the days.  I started to notice that he spends a lot of time masturbating.  When we started dating, we both knew that we had incredibly high sex drives, but I didn't realize how high his was until recently.  \nHe spends upwards of three hours a day masturbating.  When I'm asleep in the morning, I almost always wake up to him masturbating.  He does it when I go out to visit people, when I am in the shower, when I'm in the room with him.  \n\nI have brought it up that I am willing to have sex, and we do have intercourse one to three times a week.  We had a talk last week about how I don't appreciate when he doesn't include or even ask me, I'm all about the mutual masturbation, we've done it several times, usually while watching porn. \n\nAfter I had a bit of a panic attack/break down last week, I explained that I was a little worried about his habits.  He said he would stop doing the ones I was uncomfortable with, which were erotic Rping and things of that nature.  As far as I know, he hasn't continued the Erotic RPing, but has expressed an interest in maybe picking it up once we have cleared the air on it a little more.  \n\nAm I right to be worried? \nDo I need to bring up that I am a little worried about his habits again? \nIs porn addiction a possibility?\nTL;DR:"}

And I have always been attracted by women, my entire life, I just find them so sexy and alluring. A lot of my prior ex-boyfriends have known for me to have this kinky fantasy of wanting to sleep with women, and have treated it as such. For the past few months, I've been single and have been having a sort of dry spell when it comes to men. My best guy friend told me he was in love with me and then ruined our friendship and my ex-boyfriend still pesters me to sleep with him. This has sort of put me off and has made me consider going out with a girl.\n\nRecently, I've started taking a new class. Today, one of the mentor's showed up. She was absolutely gorgeous, everything about her is just mesmerizing. I could tell she was giving me a lot of really intense eye contact and giggling with me about stuff she was teaching me. I was confident but also very friendly, because I was worried she wasn't interested in girls.\n\nWhen I went home she messaged on the group conversation for the chat thanking everyone for coming out. For some reason, I feel like she wanted me to see the message. I then checked out her Facebook and gathered from all her pro-choice FB statuses and pictures kissing girls, that she must be into girls as well.\n\nClearly, I've never had any experience with another girl before. I don't know how to ask her out or how to act. Should I be confident? Ask lots of questions? Try to be her friend? Wait for the ending of the sessions of classes to ask her out for a drink? I don't know. Has anyone had experience this before and could give me with some pointers?\n\nThanks guys!\nTL;DR:"}

I don't want to.\nPOST: Ok, a little back story.\n\nI got on bc within the first 6 months of us dating because we both agreed that we wanted to take better precaution against getting pregnant. The pill that I was on was low hormone (can't remember the brand off hand, will find out and post later). I had nothing but negative side effects from the birth control. I was depressed, moody, and had absolutely no sex drive whatsoever. I would cry all the time for the smallest stuff. Our sex life severely suffered because I was never in the mood which was the main reason I hated being on it. I didn't feel like myself. After about a year of being on the pill, we both decided that it wasn't for me and that we would go back to using condoms. I have been bc free for about 6 months and he just informed me that he wants me to get back on bc to \"ease his mind.\" I told him I am not completely opposed to birth control but I don't want to be on the same birth control I was on. I mentioned an IUD but I have not done a lot of research on them. Also, I do not have insurance, and the only kind of bc I can get are pills from my local clinic so he wants me to save up and buy the IUD if that is the route we decided to go. I honestly do not want to be back on birth control. We use condoms now and that works for me, and I thought it was working for him, too (obviously not). Am I being selfish for not wanting to take bc again, and not have to pay for it? How should I handle the situation?\nTL;DR:"}

However, she continually does this thing where we'll be spending time together and she'll either invite her friends over or they'll invite themselves over, and I end up feeling like the 3rd wheel because her attention gets shifted to them.\n\nWhen I was a kid I liked being with her and her friends because I thought it was cool to hang out with older teenagers, but now I don't like it so much because I'm too different from them. I brought up the fact that I would rather spend time with her alone than with groups of her friends and it turned into a huge fight between us. She made me seem like a big anti-social bitch and interpreted it as me hating her friends. So now I'm afraid to bring it up even though it majorly bothers me.\n\nSometimes I don't mind hanging out with her and her friends when she lets me know ahead of time, but I still feel excluded. She's in a sorority so it's always her sorority sisters and they talk about sorority things (parties, personal drama, group politics) and I never feel like I can even be a part of the conversation. When it's with her guy friends they just talk about binge drinking and how drunk they got, and so on. Again, I just sit there like a SAP and text the whole time until I find an opportunity to leave.\n\nToday we were going to watch a movie together and one of her friends shows up to bring her food, but he ended up staying. They were just talking so I just stopped the movie. Then her friend wanted to go out and do something even though we were already obviously doing something. They invited me along but I declined because if I went then I'd just feel like a SAP the entire time.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been seeing her for over 2 months now, while she has been seeing the other guy for about two weeks. I knew we weren't exclusive, but the other guy asked her to be exclusive and she doesn't know what to say. \n\nShe's often horny, but she hasn't slept with the other guy yet; however, whenever we have sex, I either have a difficult time getting it up, or keeping it up. Because of medical reasons, she can't use birth control, and so sometimes between foreplay and putting on the condom, I'll soften up. Also, sometimes when switching positions, I'll just lose it too.\n\nI have no idea why this is happening. I've been a virgin until I started having sex with her, so I don't have anything to compare this with, other than masturbation, where I did not have this problem. Also, she always thinks that its her fault, and that she's not attractive enough for me to get hard, even though I am attracted to her. We've had sex without problems more recently, and usually when it didn't work was when I was first starting out and was nervous, or if we had just had a disagreement recently, but now I have no idea why its not working.

She has helped me with anger and resentment as well as arguing to the point of frustration.  \n\nNow that seems good and wonderful but here in lies the problem that I am facing, the conflicting thoughts, if you will.  My girl is small and loves to have fun with her friends, she was actually once in a sorority but dropped due to time constraints of school.  But she still has close friendships with  her sisters and one of her sisters has invited her to go to a fraternity party in a week or so, a fraternity that they know well so I'm not infuriated and out of my mind about it.  Unfortunately, I worry that something will happen.  This worry arises because over the summer while my gf was intoxicated and out with friends a man other than myself tried to kiss her and succeeded in touching lips.  She promptly said sorry I have a bf and pulled away.\n\nI'm really glad she told me and was cognoscente enough to realize it was wrong but it really hurt my feelings and I felt that it could have been avoided had she not been so drunk.  So basically I am afraid something like this will happen again or worse.  She is a tiny thing 5'1\" 110lbs and it would be really easy for someone to just take her away if alone and in a dark area.  Maybe I'm worrying too much... \n\nPlease what should I do and for those who tell me I need to not stress it so much, can you please give me some alternative to help me get over it or take my mind off of it!!\nTL;DR:"}

My bedroom was in the basement and had a carpet floor, but the shitty carpet that's all flat and rough because the people who had the house before us used it as a sewing room (old lady).

It's nice upstairs because its all hardwood flooring with the occasional rug here and there. I went back down the a flaming vengeance with this cheap-ass fabric flea spray and basically used up the whole bottle spraying down the shitty-ass carpet and couch and sides of the mattress, followed by a vacuuming.

She also denied a restraining order, fearing backlash from her brother after it expires.\n\nI am traveling home to be with mother tomorrow morning, but I simply don't know what I can do to protect her from her brother in the future. She lives alone and in near poverty. My mother is traumatized (and not for the first time) and I am shaken up and furious. I believe that her brother won't dare to harm her when I'm there, but I don't want her to live in fear and I want her brother to face up to what he's done. Abusers generally get worse over time, not better.\n\nAny and all advice comes to open ears... thanks reddit! :) This is a throwaway account...

I got broken up with then back together and broken up with after being completely alone for a week (I'm normally very extroverted so being so completely alone is agonizing at least it is with no internet.) I just moved away from home now at a new college and not in the dorms. So I actually had nobody to talk to for quite some time. I tried reaching out to my girlfriend who had been dating me for almost 2 years but she was having a tough time getting ready to move. We ending up broken up. I was so heart broken that I even had a hard time eating. I loved her more than I loved anything else in my life.  We decided to be friends but after a bit of that we dated again and I took a look at her life and realized that she needs to be able to express herself and not be tied down. So when she asked what I thought about her being unsure about the relationship I had to basically tell her that I thought it was better she be with other people. I also had to do it without showing how much it hurt or she wouldn't have done it. It's probably the worst thing. I'm not sure you've ever been in the same shoes but I don't recommend it. But we remained friends. So there is that. If you have any good jokes or just general pick me ups that's fine\nTL;DR:"}

The girlfriend confronted her boyfriend about this and he claims that he was driving in traffic and stopped to take a nap at a motel. The receipt shows that he was at the motel from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. To me, this isn't normal behavior.

Maybe there was an accident? Maybe he stayed up the all night before cramming for an exam? Maybe he really did decide to take an innocent, 2-hour nap at a motel? The reality is that at around 5:00 PM is when traffic is normally gets hectic and people normally leave to early around 3:00 PM to avoid traffic...\n\nThe girlfriend suspects the boyfriend cheated.

The knowledge that he not only has these tapes of me but also masturbates to them daily just sickens me and makes me extremely uncomfortable, so much so that I'm losing sleep over it.

I trust he wouldn't cheat on me, but I'm scared that he will leave me for one of these girls. He has a lot more chick friends than male friends and this wouldn't be a problem if he don't used to have feelings for all these girls!

I didn't think of her as much, but one night when I was drunk and she was drunk, she texted me a bunch of hot things including a hot picture of herself. I then text her a picture of my dick back. (This was a really stupid thing because, I have a girlfriend and I was betraying that guys trust). Anyway, that was months ago. I regretted it deeply, but never thought of it again. Saturday, these same people had a party which I couldn't visit because I was ill. This girl told everyone at that party what I sent her, but didn't include the fact that she was texting me in a 'sexy' way. My 'friends' already made their mind up, and told me to fuck off and said it was a horrible thing I did. This was yesterday. I apologised, realised I ruined everything, and now I am friendless. My girlfriend has forgiven me, which is a miracle. I don't deserve her in any way after this, but I am glad she has forgiven me. Now my question to you Reddit, is, what do I do? I want to earn their trust back, I want to have friends, and not be lonely. As far as I know she only told everyone about the picture, not showing/sending the picture onward to anyone. I am a 20 year old male, and I am shivering and feeling sick while typing this, as I don't know what to do. Please, I need some advice.\nTL;DR:"}

How to approach the subject?\nPOST: On mobile here so sorry if shitty formatting.\n\nI will do my best to remain unbiased but as with most /r/relationships post this is only from my perspective.\n\nSo I [23M] have been with my gf [22F] for about a year now and things have been going good. A few ups and downs but nothing that has scarred our relationship. Recently she has been texting a coworker [?M] quite a bit. For example on New Year's Eve we were together from about 6pm onward and up until about 10 she and him were exchanging messages almost every 10 minutes it seemed. Since then whenever we are hanging out I have noticed that she's texting him quite a bit. She hasn't been hiding her phone or anything and she told me about him in passing so I don't think she's trying to hide anything from me, but the idea of this guy still makes me a bit uncomfortable.\n\nHow do I approach the subject and voice my concerns without it seeming like I'm being insecure and accusing her of anything?\nTL;DR:"}

I was really shocked and asked her abruptly what the scratch marks were and where they came from. She got defensive and responded with \"nobody, and it wasn't me, just don't worry about it. I will tell you when the time comes.\" When I asked her if it was by an animal, she said \"no, it wasn't our dog, just nobody, and it wasn't me, just nobody.\"\n\nI'm really worried and freaking out at the moment, and I'm thinking of the worst possible scenarios as she is a freshman in high school and it is highly possible that she could be hanging with bad influences among other things. For the past couple of months, she's been reblogging 'depressing, grungy, gothic and edgy' fashion looks, quotes and photography on her Tumblr blog.  Although this interest of hers is not reflected too much in her behavior, I feel like this might have something to do with the scratch marks.. She also does know what 'cutting' is because she's seen it on weheartit and tumblr. \nI don't think it has much of anything to do with an abusive friend or boyfriend, as she doesn't have a boyfriend and she always comes right home after school. \nWe do have a small lap dog but those marks do not look like our dog's scratches and they are much too spread apart and in different directions to be that of our dog. She also says it's not from the dog, as I mentioned above.\n\nRight now she's trying to make me feel better by trying to joke around and bring up inside jokes that we often share, but she won't talk to me about the marks. I just can't imagine what kind of events had to take place for her to have those marks on her arm.\n\nReddit, I'm scared.. what should I do? I love my sister and I can't stand to see her hurt.. I wish she would open up to me, though I understand my confrontation reaction wasn't helpful. Does anybody have any thoughts on what she might be going through in high school? Has anybody experienced this with their younger siblings?\nTL;DR:"}

[16|m]\nPOST: Throw-away account because my friends know my real account...\n\nSo back in the beginning of this school year I met a freshman (I'm a sophomore) that goes to my school and began to like her. She was always too busy and I ended up meeting another girl who became my first girlfriend. Since then we've broken up and I have started talking to the freshman again. A couple nights ago we were texting and she admitted that she has feelings for me still, and I told her that I use to like her as well. \n\nThe thing is, I've had two girlfriends since I liked her, and I no longer feel the way I use to about most girls I know, her included. Sure, I'm attracted to them, but I don't feel a real connection between us.\n\nAnyway, the freshman and I went to a carnival together and I kissed her while we were on the Ferris wheel. We spent the rest of the evening together having fun and making out, and at the end of the night I walked her home and told her that I like her. I didn't lie - I do *like* her, but I just don't feel a strong connection between us. She's beautiful and has a great personality but I no longer *feel anything*. Her personality doesn't seem to match mine, and to me that is the most important thing (it was the reason my first girlfriend and I broke up; we saw the world from completely different perspectives).\n\nI had a very similar situation with another freshman girl at my school a few months ago: I met her at my school's freshman/sophomore formal, we hooked up, I began to like her, but then all of a sudden I didn't want her to be my girlfriend, and had to break her heart.\n\nI feel like an asshole, but right now I just want to meet new people, have some fun with some girls, and hopefully meet someone along the way that I do have a lot in common with and that I truly have feelings for.\nTL;DR:"}

He does still live with his parents, but he's working two part-time jobs right now while taking a break from community college. Not the typical american dream, but I think he's doing great. I don't think my parents should judge him for not already having a career, etc., but they do.\n\nThey don't hide their hatred, either. For example, we were chaperones on a church trip to six flags a few months ago. My mom asked, \"Oh is Joe going?\" I said yeah. She said something along the lines of, \"Great. Well I'm going to go home now and take care of my responsibilities. That's what *adults* do.\" Both of my parents constantly make snarky comments about him. My dad makes fun of him for living with his parents. A few months ago I got into a bad argument with my parents and I called Joe to come pick me up. As I was walking to his car my dad was yelling things like \"Stay out of the ghetto!\" and \"He's turning you against your family!\" Joe hasn't turned me against my family at all. That night was the first night I'd ever even talked to him about serious family issues. \n\nWe're already talking about getting married after I get my degree, and we're planning our lives around each other. Oh and I have three younger siblings who love him. He's awesome with little kids. How should I handle everything with my parents? Should I avoid bringing him up? Should we invite them to the wedding or casually let them know it's happening? It's really frustrating for me, but it's been easier since I've been at college, but I know one day I'll probably have to bring him up again.\n\nHow should I break it to them if we end up getting married? What should I say when they talk badly about him?\nTL;DR:"}

We have previous Boxer-owning experience and know we love the breed.  After a few breed confusions and other issues, we found an 11month dog on CL.  We brought him home around 7pm on Sunday night.  The first thing he did was try and attack my Newfie through the fence.  After some careful introduction, he got over that, but still growled a couple of times.  I've had abused and mistreated dogs before, and been able to help them.  \nSo that first night he spent the whole time whining.  We learned: he isn't potty trained; he has no reaction to a name of any sort; absolutely none of the basic training.  He's not playful, he's scared, his first reaction is to flee, then to fight aggressively.  \nThe next morning, at around 6am, he broke out of the backyard while left to pee for 10 minutes.  Evidently he squatted around at neighborhood kid's houses until this afternoon.\nHe not happy.  No part of his personality is that of a Boxer.  His one shining, redeeming quality is that he LOVES kids.  He's great with them and sweet.  Still not playful, but he'll stick by their side contently.\nUltimately we think he was being used as a bait dog or originally hoped as a fighting dog.\nMy question is... should we try.  I keep seeing glimmers of a good dog, but he has NO training, he doesn't even recognize responding to the sound of a voice.  It will be an ass ton of work, but I want to give this boy a better life, but if it's a lost cause, I'd still like an actual Boxer.\n\nOpinions, advice, ideas?  I'm really torn.  Either we commit to him, or we contact his previous owner (who will likely ignore me) then try to find him a new home with full disclosure.... HELP!\nTL;DR:"}

I started my weight loss journey 30 days ago with a Keytopia 10 day reset that my future mother in law gave me. I did that and lost about 9lbs and noticed all my clothing fit better. But I was skeptical about how easy living a Keyto lifestyle would be and if the weight would just come back. This is not my first time trying something like this before, last year I did Metafast for a month and lost something like 35lbs but my body does not like soy and destroyed my bathroom. And all the weight came back in less than a month. Back on topic, now that I am 20 days past my 10 day I am eating great, I'm not at the point where I'm counting calories, that will start after my next 10 day reset but I do try to limit my portions. I fell in love with EpicBar's as a good snack. And I'm making my own salad dressings. Cutting out the carbs was easy for me. The hard part was learning to drink coffee without sugar. Now I can drink it black!!!\n\nSo the huge game changer was the fact that I had to buy a smaller belt last night. I know it's a small thing and going from a 48 inch waist to a 46 is only one size on the road to a 34 inch waist. But moving from the middle hole to the next to last hole to the last hole on my old belt only to wake up yesterday and realize that my belt no longer could do its job was one of the best moments of my adult life!!!!\nTL;DR:"}

Him and I are both very open-minded people, however my bestfriend is not. My boyfriend wears makeup, nothing crazy like mascara and bright lipstick. He wears foundation and he contours/highlights. The foundation he wears is sheer-medium coverage, and I didn't even notice he wore makeup until a couple weeks into our relationship. I'm totally fine with it, I don't question his sexuality or anything. But my friend wasn't so accepting.\n\nWhen she found out she made comments to me like, \"are you sure he's straight?\" \"Maybe he doesn't like you, a lot of gay guys just try getting with straight girls for an ego boost\" and she also makes jokes about it, right to his face. At first I thought she was just giving him a hard time to be funny or something, and I thought it would just blow over as time passed. But we've been together for 3 months now and she still makes these kind of comments, and it upsets him, which makes me really upset. He had acne throughout high school which is when he started wearing makeup, and he got bullied about it. So it's a pretty touchy subject for him, and it makes me really angry that my friend is disrespecting my boyfriend like that. \n\nHow should I approach my friend about this, without pissing her off? I haven't really told her that it bothers him or me yet, since I initially thought she meant no harm by it I would just laugh a bit when she'd make comments about it. I'm not typically a very assertive person but I feel like I need to stand up for him or else I risk losing him because of this.\nTL;DR:"}

She then has dinner with said guy or something. \n\nI really don't suspect she's cheating or something, but I don't really like it. It's not frequent or with the same guy or something, and I know the guys as well. She doesn't see why I don't like this.\n\nI think I am a bit insecure. She's such a wonderful girl and I really don't think I could ever be the best for her or something, and I'm scared other guys will find out how sweet of a girl she really is.

I'm not sure if I put it right, but I think that's how I see it.\n\nAny advice/tips on how to deal with this feeling?

If something happens that he doesn't like, he'll either belittle, or act out physically. He's never actually hit me, but he'll do weird things. \n\nAn example, I was in bed working in photoshop (graphic design) He walks in and wants to go to bed. Instead of asking me and waiting for me to get up/save/shutdown, he sits on my legs (He's 6ft 300lbs) and shuts my laptop off. I'm yelling at him to get up, and he just sits there. He sat on me for about a minute while I was writhing in pain trying to get from under him. \n\nAnother example: he used to be really mean to our dog (we no longer have him) He'd pick him up by the nape of the neck and throw him into his kennel, and then turn the kennel upside down. So one night he was trying to get him to sit. Doggy wasn't sitting. He starts yelling at him. I go over to him and tell him to leave him alone. He pushes me and I almost fall over. I was 30 weeks pregnant. \n\nThis kind of thing happens every couple of months. He never really talks to me about how he's feeling. He can't handle confrontation. So instead he turns his anger inward and acts out. It's so strange. I'm left confused wondering wtf I did to be treated this way. Or is this normal behavior? I have no fucking clue. I want to say it's abuse, but at the same time the situation is so weird and the shit he does can hardly be classified as abusive. I just don't know.\nTL;DR:"}

I'd been thinking that things hadn't been right for a while. The biggest issue for me is that there seems to be some sort of compatibility issue that we just can't overcome. I feel like I have trouble connecting with her on a really deep emotional level. I'm not entirely sure of the reason for this -- I sort of attribute it to the fact that music is a huge part of my life and she doesn't really appreciate music that much. But there's also a disconnect in other ways.\n\nWe had a talk about exactly this about a year ago when I started to feel like things weren't heading in the right direction, and bless her she really tried to work on some of the things we talked about (as did I on the things she suggested). She made such an effort, but I know that she's never going appreciate these things the way that I need my lover to. The thought of leaving somebody who has tried so hard to take an interest in my life sickens me.\n\nAnyways, that's the very condensed summary of the situation. The problem is that we're both currently in the middle of exams and I don't think it's right to end a 3.5 year relationship at a time when it could potentially affect her academic future. She has only one left about a week from now, but I just feel so incredibly stressed. It's been really screwing up my own studying (to the extent that today I bombed a final for the first time ever...).\n\nI guess what I'm looking for is reassurance that I'm doing the right thing by waiting... It is the right thing to do isn't it? It's just taking a mental toll on me... And frankly it feels really wrong for me to make love with her to keep up appearances that everything is normal.\nTL;DR:"}

Got there, after I see her I remember that she's the skinniest, palest bitch I've ever seen.. I resisted the temptation to walk out and thought the wine will make everything better. It didn't. we made out, dry-humped, I came and i was disgusted the whole time. She takes off her bra and that was the deal-breaker.. Her boobs were non-existent.. Literally as flat as the palm of my hand.. this was when I wanted to bail.. I wanted to distract her attention so I slapped her forehead.. she thought this was some sort of kinky game and smiled.. I continued to slap her forehead until she was like: \"what are you doing I just took off my bra\" so I told her this was going too quick and that I needed to leave coz I haven't fed my iguana in days. She was very confused and started crying and said youre so sweet, all guys just want me for the sex and begged me to sleep over and cuddle.

Before leaving, I went to the complex's main office and informed them I was moving out immediately, and asked if there was any way to break the lease early. They abruptly informed me, no, there's nothing I could do to break the lease, and it would be cheaper to simply let the lease expire and pay a month's rent  even if I didn't live there.\n\n  Yesterday, I received a call informing me that 30 days' notice of move-out was not given, so my lease was automatically renewed for a full year term. When I went back to the main office, I was told that both myself and my insane former roommate had to go to the office together to inform them we were moving out, and the fact that I told them I was leaving a month ago was unsatisfactory.\n\nIn order to break the lease, they want 1 month's rent, a pro-rated amount for the following month, and they would keep my deposit, which I am unable to afford. If I skip out, they will send a collection agency after me for the full amount of the entire year's rent. Also, if my roommate does not agree to these terms, there is 'nothing' I can do to move out.

A fairly good deal. \n\nWe buy the TV, load it up into the car and put it under the tree. Fast forward a day or two later, we decide to open the box and check the if the LCD TV. The TV was cracked... (cue dramatic music). We bring back the TV to return and well douche bag Best Buy didnt let us return it. We then speak with the manager, and he said that there is no evidence that it was the store's fault that it was broken and we cannot return it. \n\nNow... he offers us a different deal. 50% off ANY TV in the store. Meaning, we could of bought the $5000 TV for $2500. My girlfriend and I took a day to think about it, and we declined their offer and told him we didn't. Our rationale wasn't to make back our losses, but it wasn't right what Best Buy was doing. Instead, we just ask again ask for a new replacement of exactly the same TV.\n\nStill nothing... well we made a facebook group, and a youtube video stating our case. Within our circle of friends and friend of friends, we got 500 views on the youtube video, and 250 members on our facebook group... still nothing.\n\nWe begin contacting local television stations telling them our case. We recieve some interest... however, my girlfriend's mom came to the rescue. My girlfriend's mom had got a hold of the district manager of Best Buy's number through a friend of hers (I don't want to say how). She had called that number every hour for 2 days straight.

We worked together for about 5 months and then once I left we started dating. It all progressed rather slowly as we started as friends first then realised there was something there.\n\nNow I'm quite an introverted person so to that end I don't drink or go clubbing whatever. Given she's younger and into that sort of thing its not uncommon for her to go out each week dancing and drinking. I'm obviously invited but she understands that its not my thing and isn't hurt that I don't want to go, besides we spend heaps of time together anyway.\n\nNone of this bothers me, shes very attractive and often makes friends with randoms (mostly guys) and obviously in a club they are probably after her in some way. She's extremely trust worthy and very into me so I don't feel threatened and often encourage her to go out.\n\nThe issue is, when she does go out she still accepts drinks from guys for free. Given we're newly in a relationship and she's so used to getting free drinks from all the times she's been out in the past she probably hasn't really thought about what accepting a drink means when you are in a relationship. In my eyes its sort of accepting an invitation to something more.\n\nNow the issue is not about her looking for something more and me worry about this, but rather the message she is portraying to guys she's meeting and her intentions. I know if I bought someone a drink and they accepted I'm thinking she might be into me. Am I alone on this thought? Or is my assumption correct?\n\nAlso how do I word this concern to her conveying this isn't a trust / jealousy issue but rather a you're in a relationship now and things might be different how you interact with others?\n\nThe best thing about her is she is EXTREMELY open and easy to talk to, doesn't take things the wrong way and is very caring.

This is because we generally prefer communicating in person, but more on that later. Waiting to communicate problems wouldn't be so bad if we saw each other frequently and for longer lengths of time, but as it is, we don't have much time to talk at school nor over the weekends. So problems usually have loose ends.\n\nI think this could be resolved by communicating issues over messages/text, but he's so busy that he usually can't respond, and if he does, he's not focused on the conversation because he's busy with other things. He also is now starting to prefer face-to-face talks (as do I, but talking over text is fine with me too), so his replies over text are really cursory and distant.\n\nWe're trying to work on this, but I wanted to know if there are couples out there with communication issues too, especially since this is a REALLY significant problem in our relationship that needs to be addressed quickly so that it doesn't fester (also, next year in college we'll be in a LDR).\n\nHow did you build your relationship back up? And how did you broach the topic in a constructive, compromising, teamwork-y way? Please, please share your experiences. I'm feeling really lost and upset.

It's not that I don't have much of a life - I'm actually busy a lot and do a lot of university work and activities, but I still feel kind of depressed even when I'm not really thinking about him and busy doing something else. \n\nMy other main problem is that I also feel depressed when we don't talk much, and - to be honest - he sucks at texting back quickly. I know this is a very guy thing to do and I shouldn't be annoyed, but it still makes me feel really sad when I know for a fact that he isn't doing anything and still takes 2+ hours to respond to a short message. I don't want to tell him that I want him to text more because I know he has his own life and I don't want to come off as clingy, but I really don't know what to do because it makes me feel shitty and insecure all the time.\nTL;DR:"}

How do I help him?\nPOST: My best friend, Theo was just kicked out of his house for being gay. Theo has been out in the friend group for years, but he's never told his family because he was afraid of how his dad would react. One of his classmates from highschool did not know it was a secret, mentioned it to her mom, which got back to the Theo's dad. Long story short, his dad kicked him out, and he was only able to grab his phone and his wallet. \n\nHe came over to my house, and he is currently staying here with me and my mom in one of the spare rooms. The trouble is, I don't know exactly how to help him! Theo's mom and sister are trying to convince his dad to let him come back to the house, but I don't know how safe his home would be for him? I don't know if I should encourage him to stay at our house until it's time for him to go back to college, or if I should stay out of it entirely. If he does come live with us for now, what needs to be done? I've already told him that he should get his important documents from his mom to do stuff like get his drivers permit and make sure his father is not able to access his bank account, but I am sure there is so much I am forgetting. \n\nMy mom wants to stay out this situation entirely, and not get involved. My father was physically abusive to her and my older sister, and none of them like to talk about that time. I remember bits and pieces of how scared they where when I was younger, but I didn't experience it like they did. I don't think my mom wants to deny a safe home to someone who is in that situation, but she is also afraid of getting into a situation like this again, I am afraid of bringing up bad memories by asking her for advice, which is why I turned to reddit.\nTL;DR:"}

[19/M] needs advice.\nPOST: My girlfriend and I have been dating a little over four months but have been seeing each other on and off casually over the last 18 months. A week or so ago she brought to my attention she is beginning to feel trapped. When we started dating she pushed for me to stop abusing drugs and alcohol and has succeeded. Since those were my coping methods for my depression over the last five years she has now started seeing what my depression really looks like and I believe that's what's causing these feelings. It's not that she doesn't make me happy and I've tried explaining to her that she is the one of the best things I have in my life at the moment and even though I've appeared to be getting worse her help with kicking habits has helped me a lot. She brought it up again tonight and I can't help but feel she wouldn't have these feelings if she still wanted to be with me. When I asked her if she wanted out of the relationship she tells me she still wants to be with me but why would she feel trapped? I'm not trying to force her to be with me, in fact I want her to do what ever she feels would make her the most happy. If that's not having to deal with a man child and explore her options so be it. But I don't know what her true motives are and breaking up with her using the reason of it's for her own good comes off kinda...crazy?\nTL;DR:"}

I was not interested in him initially, and one of my female friends advised me to tell him that (nicely) right away. Another female friend said that wasn't fair, and I should at least go in with an open mind and give the guy a chance. She had a point, so I met the guy for coffee. We talked easily and he's really smart and interesting and it went really well, but I still just wasn't romantically into him after that. \n\nThe next week he asked if I wanted to meet up for dinner. I figured that 2 meet-ups was fine, and then after that if I still wasn't interested I could tell him (nicely). I asked a male friend how to handle telling the guy that I'm not interested, and he told me that if someone said that to him, even nicely, he'd be really hurt and offended, and that instead I should just make sure he got the hint that I wasn't interested. So at dinner the other night (again, it was fun, and he's cool, but I'm just not interested), I paid for my meal and didn't drink and said that I didn't want to stay out late, and afterward he tried to kiss me and I turned it into a somewhat awkward cheek-kiss/hug thing.\n\nSo men of Reddit, if you were the guy in this situation, would you rather the girl just outright tell you that you're really cool but she's not interested, or would you rather just get the hint over time?\n\nAnd...\n\nIf I tell him right out, should I do it in person (thus agreeing to another meet-up)?

I am basically a Vulcan. I feel certain emotions far less than other people, or more accurately, my conscious mind is far less aware of / connected to emotions than other peoples brains are.\n\nI have never felt the romantic emotions that are part of a romantic relationship. I have dated a number of women, had sex, all that. Basically, I have felt \"friends with benefits\" about all of the women I have dated. I have always been open about this, and have had mostly that type of relationship, with the only \"traditional\" one ending in firey doom pretty quickly because I was open about feeling this way. \n\nI have never had a crush on anyone or felt that heart-puttering when near a significant other, even back during the hormonally charged teenage boy years, when blah blah blah. Friendship and sexual attraction are two very different things for me that sometimes overlap, but never with that other part.\n\nMany people have told me that I just haven't found the right girl yet, and that may be true, but I doubt it.\n\nQuestion:\n\nA girl is interested in dating me, and I would be interested in seeing her, too, but I'm not sure she really gets the way my head works with these things. We have been \"circling\" each other for a while. She is aware of my dating history and condition, but I do not think she gets it. And she is probably looking for a relationship of one type, while I am definitely looking for something completely different.\n\nIt would be unethical to put her into that situation without her full knowledge and consent (the knowledge part being somewhat questionable here) because it would eventually lead to her being hurt, but sitting her down and saying \"Look, I find you attractive and I enjoy your company, but I don't feel *that* way about you.\" Would hurt her quite a bit, too. \n\nAdvice?\nTL;DR:"}

Not sure exactly what his mix is, maybe some ACD, maybe some kelpie, but we're guessing he's going to top near 40 pounds.  \n\nAbout a week after we got him we noticed his left knee was clicking a bit and he would never sit straight, always pointed the knee out or kept it far less bent than the other. A dozen trips to the dog park later and he's hobbling and clearly in pain. \n\nThe vet we've used for over 20 years (and trust) says his ACL is 90% torn and is recommending TTA surgery that we can't currently afford. He's on metacam right now and can go for long walks, but if he romps around too much the knee starts to bother him again. They're also saying that surgery in one leg can cause stress in the other and lead to needing THAT leg operated on as well. UGH.  \n\nI'm not sure what to do here and my head is spinning. We lost our 15 year old ACD about 6 months ago am I'm pretty stressed about making the right choices for our pup's long term health. They're saying without surgery he'll end up an arthritic mess, but then also said the surgery may lead to ultimately the same issues except in the other knee.

However here is the problem I am having\n-Manager tells me he will text me my work schedule, but never does. Often times, this resorts to me texting him and getting my hours. \n-My hours in the beginning used to be from 5-10 and 12pm-5pm 4 days a week.  However, the hours now consist of 5pm-7:30pm Friday and 5pm-7pm on Sunday. Keep in mind that I am making $10 an hour. \n- My original plan to working at the restaurant is being a waiter. Before that, I was a host and thought the job was easy. Overall, my biggest question is should I quit? The lack of communication is annoying and the hours are not giving me enough money. They also say that if I do not memorize 80% of the menu perfectly my hours will be cut?\n-To be honest, I know other people work at restaurants too. But, how could someone hire me and then proceed not to tell me what time, date or hours I'm working? I find the whole process ludicrous.\nTL;DR:"}

She wouldn't give me any affection at all to the point where I had no self confidence anymore.  She hated doing anything that didn't involve spending money.  I would say lets go on a walk. She claimed she wanted to be healthy right?  NOOOO some excuse about how she doesn't wasn't to.\n\nNew girlfriend?  She is amazing.  I couldn't ask for better.  She always compliments me and loves to cuddle and give me kisses.  She pays for dates and spoils me sometimes too (the other day she brought me a milkshake at work.  How awesome is that).  She loves to have sex and is making me so comfortable.  I am actually being vocal at sex.  More so I am finishing every single time! That has never happened ever before.  I am in awe.   She loves to go on walks and hiking.  She loves being cute with me.  She is not picky what so ever so we are always trying new foods. We go dancing.  She isn't lazy and even helped my mom out with cooking when I introduced them.  I really wanna scream at how awesome this relationship has been. Blows all the past ones out of the water....  We give each other space when we want it and so I am hanging out with friends again.  I am losing weight and I look in the mirror and think \"damn I look sexy today\". \n\nBest of all.  I am no longer nuerotic.  Like at all....  I used to get so worked up over the little things and I can't remember the last time I was.  I don't get jealous in the least bit.

She would have never gone to nude beach in the US but in Europe shes fine with it. I am not okay with the idea of her being on a beach with a bunch of other naked people but she seems to not care. I have tried to stay understanding about it but I don't like it at all. One thing that gets me mad is that if our roles were switched and I was the one going to a nudist beach or doing something new and crazy she would treat me poorly and be all condescending. for example years ago before we dated i used to go to raves alot.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, tell me about a \"kickass\" friend of yours?\nPOST: Posted this simply because of the amount of comments I got for my friend \"James\". \n\nI've decided to post the Story here:\n\nI was 15. This was about 10 years ago, I had a girlfriend, lets call her Sophie, and it was my best friends 16th birthday party, lets call him Tim. The party was amazing, about 40-50 people, tonnes of beer, a hot tub, people dancing everywhere, chicks in bikinis, it was great. For the first couple of hours, I drank a little, and was in the hot tub with Sophie, talking to her, kissing her, hugging her. We had been together for about 2-3 years, something like that.\n\nAnyway, she always said she wanted to try whiskey, and I remembered that my parents had some at my house. A bottle of Jack Daniels, as I was slightly tipsy, I thought it was a good idea to get it, so I set off. When I got there, I recieved a text from Sophie asking me how long I was going to be. I told her about half an hour. After sending the text, I realised I could get there in about 5 minutes, if I used my bike. So I did.\n\nWhen I arrived at the party it was apparent that Sophie was not in the hot tub. So I searched the place. I found Tim and Sophie, having sex in Tim's bedroom. I was horrified, I loved this girl so much. I dropped the whiskey, walked out, and proceeded to cry my eyes out on the stairs. My other friend, lets call him James, comes over and asks me whats wrong. I told him what had happened, and he raced up the stairs. The next thing I see, is James punching Tim in the face, punching him in the balls (Tim's still in his boxers,) and pushing him down the stairs, James then gets everyone's attention and tells them what Tim and Sophie has done.\n\nTim and Sophie were made outcasts at my school, and James is now my bestfriend, 10 years later.\nTL;DR:"}

I would be completely okay with him going to a strip club with his friends on a bucks party or something and have visited the odd strip club together on a drunken night out.\n\nBf and I just went on romantic holiday to A South East Asian country for a few weeks. The trip was amazing and everything was wonderful. However we took different flights back due to the fact that he had to fly away for work. My flight left about 8 hours before his did and during the time he had to kill, he apparently went and visited several famous brothels by himself with the intention of just \"checking it out\". He said he didn't do anything just had a look. \n\nWe haven't seen each other in a few days because of his work trip and today was the first day we saw each other. He just told me and I was shocked and a bit disgusted. I told him it was outrageous and I was angry but he seems to think that I was \"open minded\" so it didn't really matter. His argument was that I took pole dancing lessons a few years ago (it was for fitness) so why be so selective about my \"open mindedness\".\n\nI believe him when he says he didn't engage in any of th services and just wanted to check the places out. I'm annoyed and we just had a bit of a fight about it. \n\nWe've both gone to bed angry now and I don't know whether to drop it or bring it up.\nTL;DR:"}

Today I found out I know two of them.\nPOST: hey all at /r/relationships, my girlfriend and I have been dating for around 3 and a half months now, and things are going great. I love her, we are very compatible, and we are both very happy. She's the best I've ever had when it comes to sexual encounters, and she says the same for me. \nToday we were talking about the previous partners and flings we had had. She originally comes from a different state and moved here at the end of 2012 (I met her around June this year), so I asked who the people she'd slept with here were. (Yes, I know I brought it on myself for asking in the first place)\nShe named two guys that I know personally, but she didn't realise that I knew them. I had actually known them before she even moved here, and because she's a year above she wouldn't have guessed that I was acquaintances with them. \n\nIt's not a deal breaker or anything, and my views haven't changed on her or the relationship, but I can't stop thinking about it. All I want is to stop thinking about it and continue my relationship with this beautiful girl without the annoying thoughts. Anybody care to offer some advice? Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

What stupid conceptions have you come across about the internet?\nPOST: As a 'minority' of sorts, I've been expressing my desire to move to a better, less racist country to my mother. I did mention the name Reddit maybe once to her, but have mostly referred to it as the 'internet forums', and how this place has had great discussions about almost everything, including the 'mostly generally great' \"socialist\" countries (which Reddit does circlejerk about sometimes) like Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany.\n\nBut ever since then, she's been claiming that the internet is \"full of trolls\" and they're just giving false information to everyone to troll them into thinking (in this case) that the grass is greener on the other side in another country. Everytime I say that things are usually backed up with facts/citations, the downvote/upvote system pushes bad/false comments to the bottom (ie in r/country specific and immigration subreddits), she maintains that \"nope they are all still trolls on the internet forums\".\n\nRecently she took things to a new level when I said I rarely post and ask questions about countries I'd like to move to... I just read up existing posts (via search) on what people say about moving to said countries. To which she replied \"The internet forums are just trolls. The trolls hire sub-trolls and they hire sub-sub-trolls to create these false discussions\"\n\nI'm actually rather puzzled actually by this bizarre impression of hers, because she is a fairly open-minded, used-to-be-tech-proficient person. She also doesn't believe me when I say most people these days are superficial as fuck and pick up the opposite gender for sex for the lulz. And I don't think she understands the definition of a \"troll\"\nTL;DR:"}

The break up was hard and dragged on for two months in itself... lots of talk of maybe getting back together, maybe not... all came to a very messy sudden and final end when she met someone else she was attracted to. All that is irrelevant. \n\nAlthough I loved this girl very much, she is right when she says that we had some compatibility issues (we have quite different interests) and I am coming to terms with us being apart. Tried being friends but that got pretty strained and tense when she started getting together with someone else. Anyway. I truly am coming to terms with the break up. I am devastated but hey... I tried to fix it... it didn't work. What can you do except move on or wallow in it? I miss her, but I accept that it is over and just want to stop feeling so low and lonely. \n\nThe problem is, I am freshly 34, and out of practice with dating. Almost all of my friends are settled in relationships or with children, and as such don't go out so much or have much time for socialising. My local pub is sadly my ex gf's regular haunt with her new man so I don't want to go there. As I said, most of my friends are very settled and don't go out. But... I'm trying to go out and meet new people, mostly for just social company, but I don't want to be single forever and would like to meet someone new. It is hard however to go out on your own without looking like a bit of a friendless loner and this doesn't strictly encourage interest or social interraction. \n\nDoes anyone have any good ideas for places I can go or activities I can take up that I won't look strange doing on my own and will allow me the chance to meet new people?

Yes, we are hard to be around. Yes, we're depressed and have low confidence, low self-esteem. You know what **really** helps? Being told by society at large that we're assholes and horrible people. You keep telling us we need to be confident. Ok, how? For fuck's sake! You tell us to be more confident in one sentence and then in the next tell us how pathetic we are. Do you not see how that's feeding the cycle? You, society, are confirming our irrational fears. No you don't have to be our care-takers, but it would be nice, for once, to see someone say something helpful instead of just getting mad and telling us how pathetic we are. \n\nI'm not asking you guys to sugarcoat it, or say that you shouldn't confront people about this behavior; what I **am** saying is don't just stop at telling us we have a problem.

Now I am eager to move to another job.  I need to make much more than I do now in order to pay off loans, etc.  \n\nI told the recruiter my salary when I turned down an interview for a job that paid even less.  Big mistake I know.  She was surprised I didn't make more.  At the time, I didnt think I had anything to lose because I was turning down that job. We talked, and she found a position that might fit better with my salary needs.\n\nI've now been offered this job, but it is at the very beginning of the salary range I would consider. And it would require a much longer commute. I have other interviews set up and about 5 months to play with in finding a job before my current position ends.  The company recruiter said that what they are offering is the amount they paid a person who had been in the position for years and said the hiring manager was willing to do that because I really impressed them. She implied that because this was a somewhat new field for me, I should be happy to get it. I pushed back for at least a little more and am waiting to hear back.  She implied that the number they gave was the max.  At this point I am wondering if I should just keep looking.  \n\nThe job seems cool, but the commute will cost more mentally and economically. More importantly, if they are paying me more than they think I am worth and more than the previous person, this seems like it would start things off on a bad foot or set up expectations for me to knock it out of the park from the beginning. \n\nWhat say you?\nTL;DR:"}

I bought her cones to practice parallel parking and the 90-degree backup, but when I ask her when she wants to practice, she just says \"whenever\". This has been going on for a few months now, and she has never done it. Whenever she complains about her parents, and wanting to move out, I tell her that the only thing stopping us is her getting a car. I tell her somewhat often things like when I'm free & could help her practice, but she never takes me up on my offers. These ways that I've been hinting at wanting her to get a car haven't been successful, but I don't want to be too stern about it and upset her.\nTL;DR:"}

For 3 months now she has a male friend whom she is texting a lot with. Because of her lack of friends I'm actually quite happy for her that she had someone else to talk to. Though yesterday she said that her friend didn't feel well and that he isn't responding to her messages. Later she went a bit earlier to bed. So when I came to our bed in the night I could see her phone blinking and I just looked if it was a message from her friend so that I could wake her up to tell if he was Ok or not. \n\nBut looking at their conversation made me quickly realize that he has strong feelings for my wife. I didn't see any advances of my wife into his direction but before she left for bed she asked if she could meet up with him tomorrow and I said yes of course,  if you think that he needs a friend right now... But we had plans for tomorrow and when I reminded her of them she quickly changed her mind and decided to stay. \n\nI don't know what to think. I also can't go too much into details... reddit being public and so on :/\n\nShould I confront her regarding his messages? Or should I just continue trusting her and hope for the best?\nTL;DR:"}

A little background, we've been dating for 1 week short of a year. We took a break last summer and it didn't work for either of us and we got back together a few weeks into school. It's been mostly good, with a few bumps but nothing too big. \n\nOn Easter my girlfriend and I broke up. She was having some problems so we we're talking on the phone and it came out that she hadn't been happy lately. She also said that it wasn't just me, but that's she's felt like a zombie lately, no feelings at all. So it ended up in a breakup, but I don't think she was very sure about it. \n\nWe talked again last night and she still didn't seem confident about it. She just said she needed to be on her own for awhile and that she wasn't happy. Is there anything I can do to help myself? I don't really want the advice saying you're young, get over her. It just doesn't work with her and I know I want to be with her. Thanks guys.\nTL;DR:"}

However, he terrorizes my Siamese to the point where she will not eat or go to the bathroom. A vet suggested we put him in his own room so they can smell each other and we locked his cat in his game room so they can still spend lots of time with each other. Well, at night this cat howls and howls and I can't sleep because of it. We've tried locking my kitty in my craft room, and she does fine; we did this so his cat can have free run of the house. He will still howl outside our bedroom door. Last night, we tried letting him in our bedroom to sleep. He howled and jumped all over my head. He did this when I would visit my boyfriend in his apartment, too. \n\nHe told me to wake him up when his cat wakes me up. So I do, and he locks him in the laundry room or the garage where he's quiet for about a half hour and then howls LOUDER. My boyfriend can sleep through this.

Should i ask her what happened to her boyfriend? I know one her best friends, should i try to ask her if she is actually interested before making a move?

I'm somewhat ashamed to say that it was not secondhand truama that led me to weep in the bathroom stall like a little girl, but my coworkers. It had been a rough day, which are pretty normal around here, but it was a tolerable level of rougness. My patience was wearing thin and I just wanted to go to the support group for advocates and take a breather.\n\nUnfortunately, my coworker decided at that time to demand that I clean one of the recently vacated rooms. Not just clean it, but DEEP clean it. I'm not talking clean-it-like-your-parents-are-coming-home-after-a-weekend-away type clean. I mean, she wanted it hospital-grade clean. She wanted to be able to perform surgery on any surface of that room. The checklist she gave me- handwritten of course- had at least thirty tasks on it. For a dorm-sized room. \n\nI lost it, guys. I just completely lost my shit. I told her that I would be happy to help clean that room, but she was absolutely off her rocker if she thought I was going to spend the next four hours cleaning by myself. She was incensed at my apparent refusal, and though I tried to reiterate that I would do it, but not alone, she started screaming for the lead advocate to put me in my place. \n\nWell, the lead advocate just didn't want to deal with the situation and told me to just do it. I was absolutely frustrated, appalled, and overwhelmed. And so...I went into the bathroom and cried. Then I went and cleaned the stupid room.\nTL;DR:"}

Goal weight is 125-130lbs, or whenever I'm the fittest/running the fastest. I have a history as a competitive long-distance runner for about 4 years now, but after a bout of anorexia in which I wasn't allowed to run plus an injury that put me out of running for 1+ year, I ballooned up to my current weight and it feels like absolute shit. Motivations for weight loss are aesthetic reasons, confidence issues and the fact that it's seriously hindering my running. I'm larger and slower and it sucks, especially since I'm keen on training for an ultramarathon next year and all this extra weight's gonna be a huge burden over a hundred km. I've also done a bit of lifting (Starting Strength, StrongLifts) and yoga but that was 2 years ago.\n\nI've been trying to calorie count but I always fall off the wagon; this is a personal discipline issue though, one that I'm definitely sorting out. (As for the ED thing, no, calorie counting and exercise doesn't affect me any longer, thankfully. I have a pretty healthy relationship with food now except I tend to sleep at 3-4am and snack mindlessly then. Gotta change that.) I'm keeping to about 1200-1300 kcal a day, inclusive of exercise. What I'm curious about is that for most effective weight loss, should I run, lift, do both, or do neither?\n\nI mentioned that I fell off the running wagon for a while but now I'm back and the past 1 month or so I've been clocking in at least 20-30km a week on trails and roads. Also doing some bodyweight strength stuff using the NTC app. I'm unsure if I should add lifting to my routine, increase/decrease my running, or do both, or cut out any exercise altogether.

Strangely enough, she has close friends that are gay, and she isn't at all a homophobe. She insists that the only reason she gets worried about us is that \"he is not bi, he is gay\", and has mentioned a rule that \"you don't date bi guys\" (about guys dating bisexual girls, she could not be reached for comment). As he has never seriously dated a guy (or even kissed a guy for that matter), I would classify him as bicurious or attracted to both (he has had a few girlfriends that he was somewhat sexually active with). He is a very sweet boyfriend and I have never had any reason to worry about him not being attracted to me. However, she claims because \"she's been around the block and talked to bi people, both male and female\", and that her authority on the subject trumps mine because I'm not yet legally an adult. She's not forbidding me from seeing him, but it's clear that she's upset for some reason. \n\nSo, Reddit... what do you think?\nTL;DR:"}

I told him that I didn't want to date anyone though since I recently went through a breakup about 6 months ago. After me saying that about 3 times, he agreed and said he liked being single. We became intimate about a month ago and have been spending every weekend together and some weekdays too. I told him that I didn't want to spend the night with him so I don't develop feelings and he said that was ok, but kept hinting that I should and I eventually did about 3 weeks ago. Since then, I've been spending the night every week, cuddling with him, running errands with him, and other things that aren't sex. \n\nLast weekend, I realized I was getting feelings for him and asked him if we could be exclusive. He said, \"that might work, can I think about it?\" I told him that of course he could, and the subject was never brought up again. After I left his house the next day, he didn't text me for almost 4 days, then texted me out of the blue asking how my week was. I saw him this weekend and he never said anything about our prior conversation so I didn't say anything. \n\nI feel like I'm kind of getting mixed signals from him. He treats me like a girlfriend, told me that I'm out of his league, has hung out with me and his friends together, is super affectionate, and open with me. I guess my question is: should I bring up the exclusivity talk again or just see how things end up? I've noticed that he hasn't been texting me as much since then and has been shorter over the phone, but in person has been the same. I'm confused! Any help is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

To the point where I tried to kill myself multiple when it ended because I believed life was no longer worth living without him. \n\nSeveral years later, I have not been able to keep someone in my life due to my \"wall\" preventing me from letting people in, so the time between I had short and completely insignificant relationships. Now I met this guy, who I have fallen completely head over heels in love with. I feel like I can completely be myself around him, he makes me feel amazing. \n\nThe problem is I am convinced he is not over his ex that he was with for almost 2 years. They lived together, conceived a child that then was aborted, let's just say a lot happened in that relationship. And I know a lot about it because he has been completely open about everything, which is not a bad thing but when I hear \"blah blah blah.. my ex\" practically every day it tends to make me feel like he just hasn't gotten over her. I believe it's been 8 months since they have been broken up. He's constantly bringing her up.\n\nI've gotten myself into this really deep, and I know he's not as into this as I am because about a week ago I told him I loved him, and he was flattered, but he doesn't feel the same and feels like it would be unfair if he lied about it.

We connected at a party and I decided to pump the brakes and only connect on social media so that I could check with my friend before I try to kindle the fire, out of respect for our friendship and because of the age difference. Friend told me that I had the green light but to be cautious because she had recently been talking about trying to get back with an ex and she doesn't think it's a good time for me to pursue her romantically . I decided to be friendly only and message her about some topics that we talked about in person.\n\nShe was responsive and then went silent for a day. She came back and replied to a message late night on vday. Could not have been a booty call because she's over an hour away. I suspected it was because she wanted to talk to someone she likes on vday. I'm hoping it was just another day to her but I kind of doubt it. Well, I remembered what my friend said about her trying to get back with her ex so I felt like chatting late night on vday would be a bit more that just friendly. I read her message (she could see that I read it) but I did not reply. I waited until the morning to reply. Now she is unresponsive. \n\nIn your opinion, what is going on?

I had rolled up a wild magic sorcerer, and while we were all building characters, the DM mentioned that it would be really wild if I got the first result on the wild surge table (which is 1 surge per round for 10 rounds).\n\nSo we get into a fight, and I'm casting a few spells, used Tides of Chaos to get advantage on an attack roll. Then the bard goes down. So I move over him and cast a dust devil on top of us to effectively blind anyone trying to attack him further. Plan was to the try to stablize him next round so he didn't bleed out. DM called for a wild surge, which because I had used Tides of Chaos earlier, goes straight to the surge table. What do I roll? Fucking 2, which means I get the 10 surges over ten rounds.\n\nFirst one sends me to the astral plane, no helping the bard from outer space essentially lol. Second one? Astral plane again. At this point there are just these weird popping noises from inside the dust devil. Number 3? Self fireball. Fuck. Surges happen at the beginning of my turn and the astral travel wears off at the end of my next turn, so it only hurts me, but it was enough to knock me out and start me making death saves. Astral travel wears off and I'm back in the middle of the party, dust devil wore off (again FUCKING SPACE is a bit out of range for concentration lol) party all bunched up trying to help the bard.

The friendship has been on the rocks for a while, and I'm sad to lose it but I just can't anymore. With sparing you the details of the 10+ years of history there it boils down to the fact that he only thinks of himself, and his girlfriend is a horrible, mean person. The final straw happened a few weeks ago, and I've just kind of been stewing on it because I don't know what to do. I know cutting him off will be difficult because he is a huge part of my life and I'll probably have to let go of a big group of friends. \n\nSome background on the final straw. Last summer I went to a convention out of town with my friend and his friends from high school (all of whom I had met a number of times). The first night there, his friend sexually assaulted me in my sleep. It took me a few months to tell him about the incident, but basically it was horrible. He confronted his friend who sent me an apology message on Facebook which I read and ignored.\n\nFlash forward to a few weeks ago. I find out the guy who assaulted me is coming to our city for a visit and my friend asked me if I wanted to be invited along to hang out. It didn't strike me at first just how messed up that is, but after I had time to process it I had a big WTF moment where I was like fuck no, I don't want to hang out with the guy who ASSAULTED me.\n\nIt's just indicative of a bigger pattern of his selfishness. He's in my wedding which is later this year so unfortunately I can't just stop responding to messages/invitations to hang out. I'm going to have to confront him. I know we have a long friendship history, but if I send an email spelling out my feelings would that be crass?\nTL;DR:"}

For 4 years before that I would just wear my natural hair, which was incredibly awful and pitiful. Those four years were very painful and emotionally damaging for this reason, but I got through it by just not thinking about it and ignoring it.

I basically ignore the fact that I'm wearing it, and go about my life like normal. To protect my pride, I typically act like it's not at all a big deal. My SO was very understanding and accepting when I first told him about it. \n\nThe problem now is that he **really** wants to see me without my wig. To him, my refusal to show my real hair means that I don't trust him. He is taking this very personally, and getting upset every time he brings it up and I tell him I can't show him. I don't think he understands how painful and difficult this is for me, and it's unfair for him to connect it to the degree to which I trust him. He says that he wants to see me being vulnerable, because that is \"pure\".\n\nOther than the pure shame that I feel, here is why I can't show him my hair:\n\n1. I find myself completely repulsive without the wig, and I just don't see how I can show it to him and have him still be attracted to me. \n\n2. He thinks that seeing my real hair would be like showing him my true self. But I feel like the wig **is** my true self. Seeing my natural hair would show him a pathetic damaged side of me, which is just not correct.\n\nHow do I convince my SO that not showing him my hair is in no way related to how much I trust him? Is there a different perspective on this issue that I am not considering?\nTL;DR:"}

Top left tooth was extracted, bottom left tooth was impacted and surgically removed. Felt almost no pain the day after the procedure, and stopped painkillers.\n\nThe pain is a sharp, throbbing/stabbing acute pain that appears to move around the molar to incisor area, occasionally radiating to the back jaw and ear/throat area. Running my tongue along the back of the teeth while it is hurting causes more pain. Started hurting on day 7 after extraction - I had been playing/tugging on the stitches, and I thought the pain was related. Took naproxen, pain stopped. Pain returns (but less acute), took another painkiller, pain stopped. Day 9, went to dentist to get stitches removed, hadn't experienced pain for almost a whole day and I didn't mention it. Starting hurting again about a day after the appointment.\n\nThe pain doesn't last very long - once a day, or every other day it hurts, and goes away after about 1-2 hrs. It doesn't hurt while eating, but i mostly chew on the right. It comes on very suddenly (and VERY painfully, was woken up by it this morning) and seems to leave just as abruptly. No discharge from the socket either.\n\nIs it dry socket? The dentist didn't say anything when she saw me. And I am reluctant to go back and get it checked out, I paid $70 for 5 minutes of squirting liquid into socket/removing stitches. And the pain seems to focus more around the pre-molar/canine area than in the back. Any clue what the problem is? Not keen on spending much more money after massive wisdom tooth expenses.\nTL;DR:"}

The email contained a pic of his face and him complimenting someone's pussy and saying he'd like to meet.\n\nAt this point I almost threw up. I try my best to make him happy, he's a very kind and sincere person, and I'd never imagine he'd do something like this. His ex before me cheated on him multiple times and he has, MANY times, expressed how disgusted he is with people that cheat and how he'd never do such things.....  \n\nI don't care if he met her or not, what he did is clearly... I just can't. I can't believe he'd do that to me. The email was from 5 months ago, which is around the time we were planning to move in together (we currently are living together). I feel twisted inside, I can't even form proper thoughts. I have to wait for him to get home from work to talk, but, I don't even know if I want to? Where would I start?

We both agreed that our 4 year relationship was heading south way before this incident and we parted ways as friends. Now me and my current boyfriend are going on our 1 year anniversary on May 7th.)\n\nOkay, since we started dating my boyfriend likes to \"spoil\" me on special occasions. For my birthday he took me out to eat at an expensive Hibachi restaurant. For Christmas he bought me a beautiful sterling silver bracelet and for Valentine's day he bought me a sterling silver necklace. \n\nI appreciate and adore the gifts that he buys me, but I'm at a point in my life where I'm trying to take care of some debts. I have a huge car payment and other bills that I have to take care of. He's not the kind of person to expect expensive gifts in return, but I still feel like it's not right if I don't return the favor. The problem is that I can't afford expensive gifts right now. I caved to the pressure and put a $300 beluva watch on layaway. It's not impossible for me to pay it off by our anniversary, but I won't be able to pay some of my bills. After thinking it through carefully, I bought a cheaper watch and I'm going to tell the jewelery store that I changed my mind.\n\nI feel so guilty about it, though. Guys and gals, we're barely going on 1 year of dating. Is it normal for someone in a new relationship to skip the \"t-shirt, cd\" gifts and go straight to jewelry? My family says that I'm overreacting and that I should just appreciate the gifts, but I can't shake off this guilty feeling of not being able to spoil him back. I want to, I just can't right now.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I play league of legends together regularly and we both really love the game. He, however, is much better at this game, as well as practically any other game, than I. I've never really enjoyed playing any video/computer game. Until I was introduced to league, that is. I'm not very good and he knows this. When I first started playing I was awful. I played a lot and became better with his help but even at level 30, I play \"as if I am level 10\" (according to him). We really like playing with each other and not alone, but it seems like half the time we do play, we fight. I mess up, buy the wrong items, walk the wrong way, feed, don't use skills correctly, ect....   and he gets a little frustrated, which makes me really angry. I want to do well and to make him proud. But when I get angry in response to his being annoyed over how bad I am at the game, it starts a huge fight. I just feel hopeless whenever I dissapoint him in a game and I blow up in response. I tell him that I need him to remember that it's just a game all the time, and he does know that. But if we lose the game (which is a team game, and my badness really affects the whole team), he acts as if he's wasted an hour and I feel absolutely horrible.

However, the excuse is that in the long run they will help. It got me thinking that a deficit is a perfect boogeyman. It is intangible, can't be touched, can't be seen. It can be used to excuse any sort of behaviour.\n\nIn Britain, the measures our government is taking is meant to reduce the deficit over 5 years.

Don't get me wrong, it's great and all, but I have started to feel trapped and things getting stale.\n\nI work for a news station, so the hours are somewhat odd and demanding. As of late, a lot of coworkers have been going on vacations and other getaways; and it's starting to really bum me out. My only two days off are separated, and I was just informed that no one is allowed to take vacation time during the months of Feb, May, July, and Nov (TV ratings months). \n\nI feel that if I don't somehow get out of here and go somewhere else briefly, I'm going to break something. I also have realized that all of my hobbies have fallen by the wayside. I no longer have a gf, and I recently moved to another part of town; where there is not a lot to do. \n\nI've always been very into photography, videography, and other artistic things; as well as rock climbing and camping.\nI no longer even have time to do anything that interests me. I wake up, go to work, and then come home exhausted. On my days off, there are only so many hours in the day, that I have to run errands and take care of crap that I don't have time for during the other days. I would say eff the errands and go rock climbing at our local grain elevators (OKC OK) but their operating hours are ridiculous and don't even match my schedule.\n\nARRRHHHH just typing this out stresses me out. I don't get paid a lot, so my bank account is constantly crap (even when I don't do anything), but I NEED to go somewhere or do something. I'm out of ideas. I don't know where to go, or what to do. The whole idea of a \"cheap vacation\" makes me laugh and then cry. \n\nWhat to do reddit?\n\nnote: I'm sure there are grammatical errors in there. IDGAFOS.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (19 M) went on a date with a girl (22 F) last week, she hasn't texted.\nPOST: I challenged myself to ask out the prettiest girl of all of my four classes as an experiment. The goals were to even have the balls to ask her out, since I never talked to her much, and handle rejection well. Well she said yes to my proposal of walking to a close by coffee shop.\n\n    I was proud of myself for keeping my energy levels high, keeping up conversation, and avoiding mundane \"So where do you work,\" or, \"what are you studying,\" questions. We both had a great time, it felt like. We were laughing and talking as if we had known each other for a while.\n\n    Considering I had never asked out a girl before, or have done any type of \"first date\" scenario I made a couple of fatal mistakes. Firstly I didn't make physical contact throughout the date so that only helped me chicken out of kissing her. The second mistake was giving her my number as opposed to getting her number. Everyone, even my councilor, told me that was a no-no. Girls apparently like it when the guy starts the conversations at first. \n\n   After the date I continued to over analyze everything that went wrong, I couldn't tell if she only said yes out of being polite or not.  At the end she gave me that Christian side hug, but she agreed to wanting to go out again. I also don't know if that was just being polite. \n\n    Here we are today, a week later, and my mom comments that I should Facebook message her. Two other friends and my councilor told me to do the same. I feel like it's too weird and that if she wanted to go out again she would text me. I know it is a busy time, since it is finals' week, but I feel like she still would have texted me. I had a really good time with her, but still think going through Facebook is creepy. Should I message her like my friends want me to do?\nTL;DR:"}

I have been seeing this doctor for about 9 months and I am looking for a new psychiatrist simply because this one is not a good match. I do not have a new psychiatrist but have several lined up to see at the beginning of next year and instead of having my records sent to a bunch of doctors I'm not even sure I'll be seeing for good I was hoping to obtain my records to bring in to the doctor I decide on.

She is also extraordinarily beautiful.\n\nLet me make this clear: **I WANT A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP, NOT JUST SEX**\n\nSo, I have known this girl in school for about a year, but we just recently started talking and we have a lot in common. My friends that know her have been encouraging me to ask her out. For some reason I feel emboldened right now and I want to ask her to dinner and a movie or something pretty low key. I don't know what would be a proper amount of time to wait (or not wait). I do believe that the feelings are mutual too. \n\nAnother thing is that my family is going on a trip over the holidays... should I ask her before I leave and give her time to think, or should I ask her after I get back? She likes scifi and stuff so I was thinking about asker her to see the Hobbit? Also would it be to early to give her a small Christmas present?\nTL;DR:"}

This is our second year in college so long distance hasn't really caused any problems. \n\nLately, she has been getting a little distant.

I feel I'm compromising way more just to be with him, for example spend the Tuesday evening with his rather boring friends... It's ok for me, I'm happy just to see him, but he just never seems to do something he doesn't want to just to be with me.\n\nOne example, his friends were planning on going to a ski trip for New Years Eve, and even though I don't ski, I said I'd come because I didn't want to start the new year without him. Had to cancel nonetheless because of financial reasons. He said he could cancel too, but the next day, he send me a text saying he booked the trip. I just know, if the roles were reversed, I'd never do that.\n\nYesterday was another thing. A friend of mine visited me, and my bf and I made plans to see each other afterwards. I've got a lot to study atm, so it's not like we see each other all the time. So, I was happily calling him after my friend left, just to hear that he had actually been sleeping. Probably not even thinking about our plans or that he might tell me he's going to sleep so I don't look forward to nothing the whole time.\n\nI don't know, maybe I didn't put my foot down at the beginning of the relationship.

I developed feelings for her during the trip, but have kept it to myself up until recently. Keep in mind that everyone on the trip are from different schools, but the same state. Its a rather small state, so seeing each other isnt really that big of a problem.\n\n   So we hang out for about a year every now and then, things arent too serious and its mainly just little friendly hangouts. However, I've been to a few formal/romantic events with her, such as spending valentines day with her and attending her graduation party. In both events, I brought her roses, along with a card for valentines day to make my intentions and feelings for her a bit more clear.\n\n   A little while back, I told her how I feel about her, and she responded by saying that she needs more time to get to know me and that she still had feelings for an ex-boyfriend, who I had no idea existed. So here's the issue: she's moving across the country in less than a month for college and I won't be able to see her regularly. I really like this girl, but she is hung up on another dude and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to proceed. Do I wait for something that may potentially never happen or do I cut my losses and move on? Could someone with experience in long distance relationship(s) provide insight as to how it is? I have never been in a long distance relationship, let alone any relationship, but I really feel like I can handle it and distance shouldn't be too big a problem.

She's never been gone this long, never overnight, and it's been super rainy the last two days and I don't think she's ever been in a giant rainstorm.

I believe I am much more attached than he is and I struggle to trust that someone could care for me in general (this is something I'm working on). \n\n* Three times in the past 2 weeks I've dissociated myself during intimacy, which is sickening. I'm also afraid that we have very little in common aside from sex even though we go on dates, see each other frequently and talk daily.\n\nHe likes that our relationship is uncomplicated but has all but begged me to communicate my emotions instead of withdrawing in the past. I really care for him but for the first time in a relationship, I'm not getting the emotional validation I need and I can't tell if it's because I'm unconsciously pushing him away or if he isn't invested in the ways that I am. \n\n**Question:** How can I explain the problems I'm having and ask how he feels / where he sees our relationship going in a way that will be constructive rather than devastating? I am notoriously bad at talking about feelings and have considered breaking up just to avoid that conversation. Any advice or thoughts would be immensely appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I was very against that, but now that almost 3 years have passed I'm getting anxious! It really hasn't helped that his 25 year old sister has just gotten engaged and as he said 'stole our thunder'. That has been pretty rough on me, seeing as they're a super close family and I feel that everything that his sister is talking about, planning, celebrating was supposed to be ours first. She's the type of girl who is always fashionably dressed, is the only girl so she gets all the attention she wants. I love her, but I can't help but feel this animosity towards her and her fiance. Not to mention before she was engaged we spoke about this a few times and she kept telling her fiance that he had to speak to her brother to make sure that their plans wouldn't interfere, which the fiance never did. I'm surrounded by a lot of weddings at work and I get so sad thinking about how I'm not engaged and not able to start planning our own celebration.

I know that I let hypothetical situations exacerbate in my mind. I over analyze everything and I know it is killing my relationship.\n\nWe got into a major fight in October over me being jealous about her suddenly becoming close friends with a couple single guys at the bar she frequents. I overreacted badly and I know it. We were yelling for several hours. It was a blow out fight but we got through it, I have since realized that it is more about my insecurities than anything else. We made it through and bounced back to a better level of trust and affection.

She goes there every week when I am at work and only when I am at work. She has never bartended, so I thought it was weird he just openly offered her the job.

She's okay with this because she tells me that whatever happens would happen anyway in a different place, and we can't be stopped, but she hopes she taught me well.\n\nThis isn't the case. We had each other stripped down pretty much as soon as we went to bed. We were able to successfully pull it off without being interrupted, and all the evidence was disposed of. Cue morning, when her parents come to get her. I'm helping her gather up her things from Christmas and what she brought over. Her socks are laying in my chair, and I pick them up and toss them to her right as she and my mom both walk in. She fails to catch them, and they fall to the floor. No big deal right? Until I see that her panties were also with the socks. My mom looks down and gets a strange look on her face. Mentally I'm shouting \"Fuck fuck fuck\" in my head and give my GF the most awkward goodbye in the world. \n\nIt's been a day, and my mom hasn't mentioned anything so I'm pretty sure we're in the clear.

Pretty mutual and 6-7 months down the line (now) he's uncertain as to whether he wants to meet up with me.\n\nHe told me that he would meet up with me on the condition that I didn't say anything about the relationship we had or make any references to our past. I responded by saying that this would be near impossible in my eyes, due to how I've known him. Our memories would have to be wiped and we'd need to be strangers again. I said that I wouldn't mention anything about the relationship but I'm also not going to pretend like nothing happened either.\n\nHe tells me that he's \"completely\" over the relationship, but I'm still confused as to why he feels fearful/uncomfortable over meeting up even if we do talk about the past. Surely if you were over something, it no longer makes you uncomfortable talking about it? In regard to this, he also reminded me that he was the one who ended it, not that it's relevant to moving on (so I replied).\nHe said I was cold for saying that I no longer felt sad over our relationship but nostalgic. I then explained why I felt how I felt; things didn't work out between us, it would therefore not have worked in the long run. It is how it is, you've just got to accept it. And how I take away all the good times/memories from the relationship.\nAdditionally, just some background on him. When his dog passed away, he bought a new one the next day. And he tells me he gets upset and cries over his grandad's memories. He's also dating a girl since August this year and aggressively claimed to me that he's no longer bi, when I asked him to tell his girlfriend about the meet up if he felt necessary.

I thought this was odd because of how well we were getting along, but respected it and let it be.\n\nA few hours later I got a text from her (she got my number from one of our mutual friends) saying that she had a lot of fun tonight and that she was sorry about the number thing -- she was in a complicated situation and trying to get over someone, and that for some reason it was making her apprehensive.\n\nIn my response I explain my situation -- I just got out of a 3+ year relationship, and while I too am a little wary of starting anything with anybody, I had just wanted to talk again and get to know her a little better (to me a phone number didn't seem like such a big deal, but I don't know her circumstances and I didn't want to pry). She says that she should have herself sorted out closer to the end of the summer and could we talk more then? I didn't so much agree to this as I said something to the tune of 'you need to do what's right for you, you have my number'. \n\nSo, the problem is that while I should just be moving on and letting this be, she really made an impression on me. I want to respect what she wants, but I also really want to talk to her. I don't like these situations where I feel like I have no control. Furthermore, since our mutual friends have taken off to Europe, there's no way to hang out with her without the two of us directly contacting one another.\n\nMy concern is that by the time a couple of weeks roll by, she'll have forgotten about me.

Their health insurance agency will not cover my dad going to Iowa City for treatment.  My parents are shattered.  This was the best place they could take my dad for treatment.

I spend time and energy trying to support and comfort him, and it feels like my efforts are meaningless. But I don't want to say that and pile on to the negativity he's already feeling. I don't really want to say anything actually. Trying to be optimistic makes him feel worse, just listening isn't enough, and saying \"I'm sorry you're feeling like this\" over and over obviously isn't helpful. I tried to mirror what he does when I'm feeling sad, which is to remind me of the positive things that are happening in my life. But when I did that he said it wasn't helpful, because his issues aren't related to a warped perception things. Anyway I'm at a loss and I feel like a complete failure as a partner.

I insisted over and over again she go to the police and get the ball rolling but she was afraid the guy would hunt her down and hurt her. I felt bad, but it didn't change the fact I had already disliked her.\n\nThat explained her crazy emotions. \n\n(Insert winter break)\n\nWe come back from break and she goes off the wall, having double digit one night stands in a month, including sometimes multiple in one night. I don't use the term lightly, but she became a slut. I attribute this to it being her 'get away' from the pain.\n\nWhat I didn't know till the last week of school after her crazy sleeping around habits continued, her best friend told me she was worried about Rachel's sleeping around because Rachel has aids. Best friend (lets call her Kate) didn't know how she got it, but confirmed she had it. Kate doesn't know Rachel has been raped. \n\nNow I'm the only one who has the complete picture and Rachel is actively ruining lives and I don't know if I should intervene. \n\nKeep in mind: Rachel and I are no longer friends or even talking because of our personality differences.\nTL;DR:"}

I understand her concern but I seriously don't understand her views and I'm sick of arguing with her and listening to her arguments, which don't even make sense and are usually reduced to, \"I cannot accept this, I'm always right, [in this case] guys and girls should not live together until they're married\". \n\nHow do I reconcile our views and make her accept mine and I don't know, let me live my fucking life?\nTL;DR:"}

She's been texting me and she's been saying that she still wants to be friends, and that her number one priority is to make sure that I get over her and I'm not miserable. But I am. I can't stop thinking about why she's \"lost feelings\" for me in the span of one week (everything was perfectly okay before).\n\nI've been extremely upset at work, and school, and I've had a few nights of crying alone too. I can't somehow stop thinking that she's hiding something from me. She's obviously not reacting the same way I am, which also bothers me, because we had a great relationship. The other night, she went out to party and had lots of fun and I sat at home and nearly cried the entire night. I'm afraid of being alone, but I'm not an ugly guy. I know I can go out there and find someone else very quickly, but I'm just feeling very heartbroken at the moment. Anyways, I'm not sure what to do.

Joe has been pretending to be me on a couple of dating sites for a couple of years now (plentyoffish, tinder, and facebook) trying to get nude photos from girls. I found out about this when I was camping and Tammy called me up calling me a piece of shit. Tammy thought it was me because it was really hard to deny all the pictures of me on Joe's dating profiles. I was finally able to convince my wife that it wasn't me once she emailed Joe's POF profile and Joe replied while I was right beside her. Over the course of three years  Tammy has been getting messages from family members and random girls saying that I am a cheater. Obviously this is affecting my marriage.\n\nSo how I found out it was Joe. Yesterday Tammy received an email from a girl, let's call her Jane. Jane told my wife saying that I was cheating on her yet. Tammy called Jane and explained to her that Joe has been using my pictures and that it wasn't actually me. Jane provided us with a phone number that Joe has been using to text Jane with. Joe has been texting Jane since November looking for nudies. Tammy called Joe's number looking for Brad (me) and Joe said that Brad wasn't here right now. That's when Tammy flipped right out on him and called him a piece of shit for stealing my identity and he hung up. So my sister called him and he didn't pick up and it went to his voice mail and Joe said his real name. Joe called back because that is his work phone. He is a cars salesman and he didn't know if it was a potential buyer. My sister played along saying she was interested and found out his workplace. I checked my Facebook and seen Joe is on my friends list and that's how he was taking my photos. I met him 8 years ago at summer school.\n\nWhat can I legally do about my situation?

We have been each others' best friend and companion for the length of our relationship. He is a great guy and I am attracted to him and see many great qualities in him. In many ways, we built a little life together in the time of our relationship in the way that close couples do. \n\nCons (reasons we broke up): \nWe have difficulty seeing an easy future together due to cultural differences. Also, I get nervous/on edge around him at times because he can be critical about little things. He on the other hand feels that he wished I would communicate better. Additionally, long distance has been hard on both of us and I'm not feeling confident to move to be with him unless he can get more confident in his feelings toward me. Finally, I'm not sure of his faithfulness towards me and I wish I could hear more words of love and a future from him. \n\nWe broke up and decided to be friends, meaning that we text often and occasionally talk on the phone. In the two weeks since this decision it feels like a roller coaster of feelings for me, and he says he misses me too and is confused. \n\nHelp! Is it always this hard? Literally each time I decide to not contact him, I feel filled with pain and emptiness. And I also feel fear that I will never love anyone as much as I love him. \n\n When I do tell him my continued feelings, I feel unreciprocated and disappointed.

It's been a rocky relationship, full of up and downs. In the beginning of the relationship, we had great sexual chemistry. Eventually though, the amount we had sex decreased. Honestly, I'd say it's all on me; he has continued to be just as interested in having sex and always initiates. I haven't really had this problem in a relationship before, and I feel really bad. I know he tries and I know it hurts his feelings when I'm not as into it as he is.\n\nRecently, we've stopped having sex altogether. We maybe do it once a week. He still asks daily though. The thing is, my lack of sexual desire isn't just with him; In the past, I'd consider myself a pretty sexual person, but recently I'm basically never horny, and on the rare occasion I decide to masturbate, I often lose interest quickly. (Losing interest also happens when we start to have sex and I am into it). \n\nIf I had to guess, I could think of a number of possible reasons. Like I mentioned, our relationship hasn't always been easy, and I think the stress over time and certain events have contributed to me losing attraction for my partner. In addition, I am constantly working and have a number of big stress factors in my life. I also have struggled with depression and anxiety this past year more so than ever, although recently I think it's been a bit better. \n\nI don't know what to do.

I also work 50 hours a week, but we manage to see each other. My issue though is that my boyfriend is very sarcastic and has a very dry sense of humor, and it's become an issue for me. He'll say something that is obviously a joke, but will say it with such sincerity that I actually doubt myself. I've decided that I need to communicate my needs to him- in a relationship, I like to be verbally reminded that my partner cares about me and is proud that we're together. \n\nMy question is, is this normal? All of my friends made fun of me for the way that we started dating- we'd been seeing each other for a few weeks and I asked him about exclusivity. He thought about it for a few days and we decided to begin dating. Everyone tells me that it's weird to do things like that, and that relationships should just fall into place.

Nothing went wrong, and if things came up we always kept up good communication to try to work things out.\n\nTwo days ago she tells me she's been unhappy in our relationship. I asked her why, she said that she thinks I hold her back from doing the things she wants to do. One of our problems is that we do almost *everything* together. We don't spend time apart, which I have come to realize is bad. \n\nAt first, I was devastated and of course didn't see this coming. I'm just scared of what to do, how to act, what to say, and what I can do to rekindle our relationship. She says \"I love you, but I'm not in love with you\". When she initially told me she wanted to leave, she was set in her ways and didn't want to give me the chance to fix what she saw in me that was bad. After a few hours of talking, we agreed to give it some time to see if our relationship is worth saving. I think there is, and I'm wiling to try my hardest to make things better again. \n\nIn the meantime, we have until the end of June until our lease is up and we live together. We're spending time apart and have agreed to go to therapy to see if that helps. We're also working on fixing our communication skills. What else could I do to make things better? I am alone at home a lot and therefore have a lot of time to think about things. I don't have many friends I can go to, so I found this sub hoping I could get some advice!\nTL;DR:"}

Should I keep trying or should I just leave it be?\nPOST: Background: I am 22 she is 21 and we live together. We are both female.\n\nBasically, whenever she is in a bad mood, it seems like I am the only one she feels free to be moody around. Initially I thought it was flattering, but now it's grown tiresome to be spoken to curtly and dismissively, even around mutual friends.\n\nHer birthday was recently, and I thought I got her an amazing present, went out with her 2 nights in a row, etc. All I got by way of a thank you was a text message.\n\nShe frequently complains of not having many friends. Recently she has started bypassing me and asking my friends to hang out with her. She never invites me, it's usually my friend that gives me the scoop on the plans. I'm honestly glad that we can all be friends now, collectively, but the way she does it seems underhanded and distasteful. \n\nEvery time I've tried to ask her something along the lines of \"are you mad at me or something,\" etc. she just shuts down or refuses to talk about it. But the reason why I am conflicted is because on some days she'll be perfectly chipper and seemingly happy to talk to me. And then the next day it's like I had done something to offend her (this is impossible because we are both students and don't necessarily interact every day).\nTL;DR:"}

I forgot to mention he's single now. She told me they sung along to Taylor Swift, and also revealed they borderline text each other frequently. Not as much as she texts me but still.\n\nI've told her that I pretty much have gone no contact with all my exes because it's awkward for me to view an ex as a friend. She doesn't feel the same and I respected that.\n\nShe asked me if I was 100% okay with all this, and I told her that I am uncomfortable because I have never met this guy and based on how I view exes it seems weird to me. I told her that I'm not going to ask her to stop contacting/hanging out with him, but I may eventually want to meet him and depending on how that goes I may change my mind on how comfortable I am with it. \n\nIs it inappropriate of me to feel jealous/worried that my GF is spending time and regularly being in contact with her ex? Am I over-reacting? Is it fair of me to ask her to cut ties with him so early in our relationship? Am I thinking about being too controlling? \n\nThis is a new relationship, and I've been a bachelor for a few years so I don't know what's appropriate behaviour by either of us.\nTL;DR:"}

My friend [23F] and I go there every so often and he noticed so we sparked up conversation and have been friends since then.\n\nI've always had a thing for older guys and I've had kind of a crush on John for the last few months. We flirt playfully but we're both in relationships and because of our age difference, that's not something I want to explore.\n\nJohn and I, along with my aforementioned friend and his friend [30M], have been hanging out occasionally all together, but John has recently asked if I'm free to hang out other times. Both of our schedules are packed so we never made a plan. I'm not sure if it's weird if just the two of us do something together, because the last time we were hanging out, our friends had wandered off and he ran into someone he knew. I overheard the guy he ran into ask if I was his girlfriend and it was kind of awkward.\n\nMy SO is totally ok with my friendship with John and they have met, but I've never met John's SO.\n\nIs our age difference too far apart to have a normal friendship? Is it wrong that I have a crush on him and we kind of flirt, even though I don't want to act on those feelings? Are other people going to see us spending time alone together as odd?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Whom should I contact if my court-appointed trust attorney won't return my calls?\nPOST: My grandfather's trust is under the control of my self-serving aunt and a court appointed trust attorney.  My mother was the co-trustee initially, before my aunt hired an attorney of her own who put an illegal mortgage on the trust property.  My mother really struggled with the legal stuff and managing my aunt.  She brought illegal-mortgage-guy before the bar, who dismissed the case, and decided he had done nothing wrong and awarded him his fees; he then helped my aunt get my mother removed as trustee and replaced with our first court-appointed trustee.  His health was poor, so he dropped out and was replaced with our current co-trustee (who is office-mates with illegal-mortgage-guy).  Between the three lawyers, we think their fees are going to eat away at least a third of the trust's worth.  The issue now is that the property was sold, and the money is in escrow.  We have been driven into debt with all of the shenanigans, and the new guy refuses to return our calls and tell us what is going on.  We suspect he is drawing out the process to rack up even more fees and/or that my aunt is causing more trouble.  \nWe are hesitant to contact the Bar Association because we don't want him to bolt and bring in another trustee, or worse, leave my aunt as the sole trustee, but we need him to provide us with information, and, god willing, give us the money to which we are entitled.  We just want to get our lives back on track.  What other recourse do we have without actually going to the Bar in terms of getting him to act honorably/ethically and do his job?\nTL;DR:"}

We have basically been together for 6 years (some trip ups here and there) and despite many problems we had, we are very strong together. \n\nWhen I was about 14, our parents confronted which resulted in his parents telling my family off that I was disrupting his education and we could no longer be together. It was very messed up, his father would tell my parents to discipline him because he wouldn't listen to his own parents.\n\nWe had many discussions about whether we wanted to be together but we stuck with it anyway. His father had said some things to my mother that made her retract instantly and cut off all communication.\n\nFast forward about 3 years and my boyfriend has finished high school.

However, upon mentioning him to my mother, she said that \"it's great that he is a great friend to you, but he will never be your boyfriend\" which obviously was a shock to me because of how long I have been together with him (she wasn't aware). I have been building up his image to my mother and he is genuinely a great boyfriend.\n\nMy mother is worried that I'm going to get hurt, but I really do love my boyfriend and we want to be together.

Things started off great, however, he lost his job about a year ago, and things have gone downhill since then. Initially I assumed this was because he was not working and was depressed, but he has recently gone back to work and it doesn't appear to be getting any better. \n\nHe deals with a lot of anxiety and depression, so I have done my best to be supportive through this very difficult transition in his life. However, it is getting to a point where I feel like I can no longer support him to the degree that he needs, I'm losing the ability to continue being his sole source of emotional support day after day, and I feel awful about it. However, I also feel like I'm not getting the support I need at times. Lately I've been feeling like I'm giving a lot of support and not receiving much in return. I feel we have very different perspectives on the world. He tends to catastrophize, so there is something new every day that is completely world ending, and I'm running out of energy to keep up. \n\nThe times when he is not stressed out about something are great, we love spending time together, and I feel like he really gets me. But when he's feeling down it can be really hard and I feel like it's really starting to impact my ability to take care of myself. \n\nI don't really feel like I'm ready to give up on this relationship yet, but something's gotta give.

New Jersey.  \n\nAbout a year or so ago, I had what I just thought to be heat exhaustion and shrugged it off.  I had a pounding headache, was very dizzy and lightheaded, very nauseous, I had trouble seeing, I can't remember if I had sweat but I don't think I did, my muscles were really hard to move and I felt really really heavy, unbelievably heavy, and I blacked out briefly once or twice.  Everyone around me noticed and helped cool me off as soon as they could.\n\nI never got it checked out.  At all.  I didn't go to the doctors about it or have blood work done or anything.  I believe I only described it as heat exhaustion if anyone ever asked, since I thought it was that, although I have second thoughts after talking with someone who officially had heat stroke.\n\nThe question is, should I get it checked into now, over a year later.  Sometime within the past 6 months or so I've experienced fairly consistent somewhat poor memory as well as having my speech deteriorate a little bit.

We've been together 6 wonderful months. He is so supportive and creative and lovely.. It feels like movie stuff, even though we make an effort to stay healthy and real and  communicative. I have never trusted anyone more and neither has he. We are have a beautiful romance and a blooming deep friendship and a crazy amazing sex life.\n\nAll of the 'problems' we have had have been me projecting my own insecurities... And usually I resolve them. But this time it's a little different.\n\nI am not a small girl. I am 5'7 and 185lbs. I wear it well, I've actually done some plus size modeling, and I know I am beautiful and weight is just a number... now. I used to have an eating disorder which I was hospitalized for, but since have 'recovered' and mostly eat like a regular person. (Although it is a bit harder to lose weight now because of how badly I fucked my metabolism.)\n\nI have learned to love myself for all that I am and my value is not determined solely by my appearance.\n\nSo, I know he thinks I'm beautiful and gorgeous and the whole world. He thinks I'm super sexy and loves me very much. I know this.\n\nBut just in passing yesterday, he mentioned his Ex, whom he was with for 3 years and who essentially broke his heart until we mended it together. They were in deep, which I understand because I had a similar relationship in the past as well.\n\nWell, turns out that she is 5' and 100lbs, at heaviest he said. All she ingested was coffee and cigarettes essentially. \n\nI haven't been able to function or feel right in his arms since. My confidence has been essentially shattered and I don't feel sexy. I feel disgusting and I can't shake the feeling that I am too... Soft. Too pliable. Too many rolls in too many places.

Unfortunately, we're both very different people that just happen to have a few hobbies overlap.  In the beginning, the differences were kinda fun, and since we only saw one another rarely (think once a week/week n a half), things never really got 'boring'.  I could overlook the differences in humor, values, and such and just enjoy the relationship.\n\nIt's not fun or even comforting anymore.  He's a good guy, but we are clearly not right for each other.  It's starting to get to the point where I'm building contempt for him.  Someone else would easily make him much happier than I would, and vice versa.  Breaking up is 100% the best thing for both of us, especially since I've let this relationship last for a year now.\n\nHowever, because he hasn't done anything concrete and is a very nice person/very much in love with me/is under the impression we're going to be moving in together soon, I am reluctant to actually do it.  Combine that with my fear of loneliness and you have a recipe for future disaster.  Eventually, my contempt and his (warranted) feelings of being under-appreciated will reach critical mass and explode in an ugly way.\n\nI don't want an explosion, but I'm too scared to end it, too.  So I'm essentially using this poor kid emotionally and it's not fair.\n\nI know this is totally childish to ask, but I would really just love a pep-talk to convince me to go through with it.  ...Please?

I never ask about this girl, but I know through mutual friends that they were pretty serious (meeting each other's families, spending holidays together, spending long weekends in each other's cities, etc.). From what I've gathered, they only broke up due to the distance (he broke up with her last year). No falling out or big fights... it just didn't work out. This shows maturity, but at the same time sort of makes me uneasy because I wonder if the feelings ever actually went away. This feeling is solidified by the fact that he still initiates contact with her and she with him. I'm not proud of this, but I checked his phone one time and found this out. He will text her things like, \"Remember when this or that happened when you were visiting...\" or sends a picture of one of their trips and then throws in an inside joke about it. He wished her a happy birthday and threw in another inside joke... it wasn't just a basic happy birthday text. They send each other songs, saw each other one time in her city after the break up and he texted her that it was great seeing her, and asks about her job, family, etc. I got the sense that she tried to cut it off at one point recently, but he persisted asking why she wasn't responding to him. The contact has slowed down a little bit, he didn't wish her a Merry Christmas, but he did reach out to her brother in law (who he's friends with) and basically asked him to wish her and her family a Merry Christmas. I know it's crazy that I went through his phone, but am I right to feel uneasy about this? Does he still have feelings for his ex? Should I just cut it off now?\nTL;DR:"}

He gave me the case number or whatever and his card. \n\nSo I guess my questions are, is there any chance of my insurance rate going up? Could she hypothetically sue me and win a case against me? Even though I am not at fault, what will this do to my driving record? Could I have a chance at suing her for damaging my car (a dent on my hood) and then leaving?\nTL;DR:"}

Pretty smooth relationship.  We rarely fight, and if we do it's low-intensity and quickly resolved.  I moved to her college town to get out of my home town and be closer.\n\nThis past week we went back to our hometown to visit family, from Wendesday until today. The drive is about 7 hours with no stops.\n\nWe got back, I helped her unpack, then got in my car and went home, since I have work early.  I get home, get settled in, and after about 20 minutes she calls me, upset, because a cock roach is in her room.\n\nShe wants me to come help her, and though I empathize with her, it's cockroach, albeit a large Florida roach, but harmless, and I decline.  She hangs up without saying anything.\n\nWe exchange a couple of texts, her mad at me for not rushing over to help her, me apologizing and explaining that I'm tired and that she is perfectly capable of handling a cockroach.  Keep in mind, I constantly do things for her.  I'm not complaining or bragging or anything, I'm just saying it's not like this is one thing on a pile of things I've declined to help her with. I'm very accommodating and in general enjoy helping her.\n\nI called her a few minutes ago to make sure she was okay and she said she was fine, but she was upset and very curt with me. I was pretty much at a loss as to what to say, so I just told her I love her, sweet dreams, and I'll talk to her in the morning.\n\nI know (I hope) that she'll be over it by tomorrow, but it seems like a pretty big deal to her, and I just need some re-assurance that I'm not a huge asshole, here.\nTL;DR:"}

When I met my roommate he told me that the deal was going to be 1000 for rent and a 1000 as a non-refundable deposit which he justified saying he had to pay it too (I read the leasing agreement and the deposit was actually only 800 which was covered I presume by him and his old roommate). I didn't think about it much since I needed to move out and desperately needed a place, so I agreed. \n\nHere's where the first red flag appeared and I should've done something, I had to loan 600 to him because one of his friend stole money out of the rent he was supposed to pay. I said ok since he promised to pay back in less than 15 days. 3 months passed and he finally gave me back the money. Also, I had been paying for most of the utilities for the duration his stay I didn't bat an eye since he had been spending 80% of the time at his GFs apartment. \n\nNow my roommate is moving out and he wants the deposit being paid by the new roommate for himself. So I asked him what had happened to my initial deposit and he had said it went to an old roommate for his deposit. I do not believe this last statement by him since that old roommate had left the apartment 6 months prior to that and there had been another roommate living in his stead in the apartment.\nTL;DR:"}

During this time she got super absorbed in school and started to ignore me. I would try and hang out with my girlfriend and she would ignore me if I came over. Many times she wouldn't even let me come over. After a few weeks of this I realized I was getting closer and closer to \"Ashley\" who was paying attention to me, talking to me and hanging out with me. I started hanging out with Ashley every day until I realized that Ashley had become my \"girlfriend\" without anything sexually happening between us. Movies, dates late night talking etc. When she finished that semester she found out how close Ashley and I had become she accused me of emotionally cheating and I would agree. I had started to care for Ashley more than I would for a normal friend. I cut Ashley out to take care of my relationship with my girlfriend. Things got better.\n\nUntil my girlfriend started working 2 jobs(60-80 hours a week) and I became 2nd or 3rd priority again. I started talking to another friend and the exact same thing happened. This occurred for about 2 months. About a week ago she dropped her second job and I became a 1st priority again. I now am dropping my other friend and it sucks.

I still try to go out to distract myself and pass the time and not become a depressed hermit, but I've been encountering the situation where guys around my age from work or other social situations are asking me to go out and get drinks with them or go do other things with them. This immediately sets a red flag off in my mind (oh god they're trying to get into my pants), but I feel guilty for thinking that. Maybe they're also bored and lonely and want platonic friends to go do things with.\n\nSo how do I respond to these guys gracefully to let them know that I'm down to go have fun and socialize, but not down to take it any farther than that?

Because of her timetable and extra curricular activities it's incredibly difficult to find a time to see her (I know this through good friends in her year who have confirmed how busy her schedule is). I want to ask her if there's anything long term in this or if she's not that interested and just wants some casual fun. I was considering asking one of her closest friends about the subject.

I was placed in an office on my own, isolated from everyone else in the branch because I'm working on a different side of the business. My manager asked me one day how I felt about working on my own, and I replied: \"I would prefer to be working around others because it can get quite lonely, but I understand if you can't do this\". When this was brought up by one of my colleagues in a meeting, he said \"no you prefer being on your own don't you?\" and I said \"no, I would prefer to be around others\" and he played dumb (\"really?\") like he couldn't remember me saying this before. \n\n3. We both had to travel 2 hours to the same location to go to see the directors of the company. It would make sense for both of us to travel together to save fuel and company costs. He tells me he is going to get the train up. I tell him I don't want to get the train, because it takes double the time so I'll drive up and pay for the fuel myself. \nOn the day of the meeting, he drives in.

However, I tried to reconcile things last week. She said she didn't want to do distance, saying it made her always miss me and held her back socially. But kept sending mixed signals like she wants to date in the summer around may and how she still feels about me. The discussion ended on poorer terms than I would of wanted. Largely due to me.\n\nI don't know what to do. I personally can't take a pause, I feel like Ill lose the intimacy we had and maybe even her. She's has gone the entire year but bails when we are so close to being together for the summer.\n\nShould I continue giving her space for a few more weeks then speak to her again? If so what line should I take? I don't want to sound desperate.\nTL;DR:"}

Well 9 years ago she decided to quit her company and start her own business.

Basically the same 5 decent sized companies keep my mom's bills paid. \n\nWell a few months ago my stepdad was diagnosed with severe cirrhosis of the liver, sever asthma as well as bronchitis.

I have never really liked a girl like this and considered doing something like this. The things that are stopping me are that I am scared of rejection a bit but mainly because if she says no I am afraid it will be awkward when we go back to school. I really don't want to be going into the new school year being anxious about that. I don't know how people will judge me if they find out I have been rejected either.

The rent advertised isn't completely ridiculous, but the situation has smelt sketchy to me since the first email. The folks renting it out are an old couple that are retiring to Dublin Ireland and were looking for someone responsible and committed to rent to. That's where I come in. After about a week long interaction, including me sending a resume' and a copy of my state ID card, they have agreed to mail me the key and security code to the apartment to check it out. They say if I don't like the place, I can send the stuff back. Here's the catch. Because of the value of the apartment, as they claim, they are sending the key with a local insurance plan that adds about 4 times the cost of shipping to the price of the package. They are asking me to first transfer money to their assistant in London (whom they have given full name and address of) so that they are sure that I will not just take the key and run. I see where they're coming from, but transferring money BEFORE getting something seems like a shit situation to be in.

Beyond that, our relationship has been fantastic. Both our families love us together, we share interests and the sex was great! This is surprising, as she told me, because she had never enjoyed sex at all, with anybody else.\n\nUntil, of course, the ED started wearing out her sex drive (so we thought). That was okay, I was happy to work with it. It hurt seeing her go through all of it, but I did and do love her, and I just wanted her to get better. A couple weeks of treatment in, she drops a number of bombshells on me. The two most important:\n\n1. She has \"gone back\" to before; she hates being a woman, hates sex, hates the way it feels, and hates worrying about pregnancy.\n\n2. A week before we started seeing each other, she was raped. She refuses to tell me any details, except that she hid it from the world and herself, and that she has made up her mind in not reporting it, and\n\n3. The only reason she was interested in sex was because, on some, subconscious level, it was her way of \"getting back\" at her rapist.\n\nMy first reaction to hearing that she was raped was uncontrollable sobbing. The staff at the hospital were very friendly and led me to the waiting room so I could cry it out. Eventually, though, it set in how fucked up it is that all the wonderful sex that we had was caused by a rape.\n\nSelfishly, I feel, I worry about the long term effect of this. If she doesn't want to have sex, it won't be long before I feel undesirable, as I've always needed that in a relationship. If she couldn't become intimate because of trauma, I would understand, but in fact, the only only reason she ever was able to do so was because of the trauma. She's still in the hospital, and since she's told me she knows it may be hard for me, I've told her I reserve my judgement until she is recovered.\nTL;DR:"}

I checked my account and she withdrew $1600 from me on one day without telling me. *I am done.*). What's worse, she's getting these drugs from MY OWN NEIGHBORS on the same floor of our building. One of them grew up with me and is like a brother to me. He's helping my mom destroy her life and our family. \n\nSo that's all there is to it. I have a brother who also knows (we spent all night talking about it). My father also sort of knows, but I am going to show him the text messages tomorrow.\n\nWhat happens next?\nTL;DR:"}

After that, I slowly stopped liking her but we remained friends. \n\nWe supported each other a lot, back then we both were deppressed so we provided mutual support, we'd go out on walks and tell our problems to each other, our relationship was very strong. Then in 2012 one afternoon she told me she liked me (I had stopped liking her a long time ago). I was stunned for a while, but agreed to go out (I thought I could like her again).\n\nWe went out a couple of times and then became a couple, I was really happy infatuated during the first month, but on the second month after she told me she loved me it all went downhill, the relationship started moving too fast for me. Also, I had already overcome my deppression but she hadn't and she needed a lot of emotional support and attention, which I couldn't give because I do not know how.\n\nBecause of that, we stated seeing each other almost daily, my grades dropped in college because I couldn't study and overall I couldn't bear with the situation because I felt like I had no personal space and, instead of telling her, I decided to break up after our 3rd month together because I couldn't bear it anymore.\n\nI felt really relieved back then but now I feel like I wronged her, I can't understand how I could do something so awful to the only woman who's actually loved me, it's one of the only thing's I regret in my life.\nTL;DR:"}

Thankfully no major injuries. I am not very hopeful as I was in the back, but I would like to fight this as much as I can.\n\nBasically, there was a line of 4 vehicles in the inside lane on an interstate with me in the back. I and the car directly in front of me had just let an ambulance (en route with passenger, ironically from a different accident) pass us, and we got back in the inside lane.\n\n There was one more person directly in front of the ambulance who claims to have panicked, and, \"not knowing what to do\", slammed on her brakes and came to a dead stop from 70 mph. I already did not get much time to react, as I had been looking right for an opening to change lanes to get away from the ambulance/possible traffic up ahead. So when I looked back forward, the car in front of me and ambulance were already pretty much stationary. I slam on my brakes and try to turn slightly right - in between my lane and the next - as the car in front of me already took the inside shoulder/barrier. I was unable to stop in time and ended up contacting the rear corner of the ambulance, and my rear spun around and went underneath a semi trailer, bouncing around to another car as well.\n\nBottom line\nTL;DR:"}

We just recently had a remote starter installed in it. I turned the car off, walked into the store, and when I came out, it was trying to turn itself on. I didn't press any buttons on the remote, that I know of, and the key wasn't in it or anything. No matter what I did I couldn't get it to stop trying to turn on. Putting the key in and turning didn't work, Braking didn't work, nothing. A police officer tried to help and we disconnected the battery from the car since my car was starting to smoke pretty badly. (The dash and electronics had turned off inside, so the battery was probably getting low too). When we tried to reconnect the battery, it tried turning itself on again. We tried jumping the car while it was trying to turn over, it almost worked, but it died when we disconnected his car from it. Does anybody know what could be going on, and how I could possibly fix this? I have a friend coming home from college tomorrow who's going to just disconnect the remote start and see if that works. Is there any other fix to it that anybody knows of?\nTL;DR:"}

I am an emotional cheater. I have been with my wife for 10 years, married for almost 4. We've grown distant as of the last year or so, mostly due to our conflicting schedules and perspectives on life. I began talking to a woman at work about 5 months ago and have developed an infatuation for her.  \n\nShe is 41 and I am 30. We share many similarities: among others, we are both in great physical shape, we are health-oriented, and we largely share the same outlook on life.  We take breaks  together and talk a lot. Oftentimes the talking turns to overt flirting.  She is very attractive and is also married, but she doesn't talk about her family unless I bring them up.  Well, yesterday I asked her if she could meet me at my truck after work so I could talk to her outside of the building. She agreed and laughingly said, \"do you think I'd say no?\" \n\nWell, I finally talked to her after work and told her that I basically had a crush on her for a few months and I needed to tell her so I could get it off my chest and move on with my life. She seemed caught off guard, as if she expected me to say something else.  She just stood there silently for a about 20 seconds. She mentioned that she already had a clue because someone else (who was apparently an expert at reading body language) told her that I \"wanted her.\"  I don't think she wanted anything sexual from me, but I'm pretty damn bad at reading into people.  Logically, if other people at work TELL HER that I'm into her, and if she doesn't want anything from me, she should have turned away and ran from the situation. So why in the hell would she continue to fan the flames by flirting with me and touching me... for months!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm a bit of a prankster, so I always want to get in on the fun that is April Fools' Day.  My target last year was an unsuspecting college friend.\n\nHe always hated having his room in any kind of mess, so I thought of the perfect prank.  I conspired with a few other friends, and I got some female friends of mine to give me dozens of their tampons. (I got them more after the prank was over, so it wasn't a big deal to them.) \n\nThe next step was to make fake blood.  A few of my friends made the blood and distributed the \"blood\" to each tampon.  I got kind of nervous about how the tampons would absorb the blood.  Just to give you an idea of how gruesome it looked, each tampon looked like a mini crime scene happened inside them.\n\nI collaborated with the target's roommate, and he made sure that the coast was clear.  After the target left his room, his roommate ushered all of us in the room.\n\nWe littered his floor, his desk, his bed and anything else that was his.  Within about ten minutes, his side of the room was entirely covered in highly absorbent tampons.\n\nThe target has class for the entire morning, so he finally got back to his room at about 1 PM.  I lived only a few doors down from him, so I stayed by my door to hear his reaction.\n\nWhen I say he flipped out, I mean his face was redder than the tampons.

For background, I went from ~240 to 190, then relapsed for about the last 8-10 months and went back up to 213 as of last month.  I basically stopped exercising and my good eating habits went awry.\n\nNow that the weather's warmer, I've started my outdoor biking again.  Not even 2 weeks into my beginning my exercises, my physiological need for food intake has changed dramatically.  It seems that all of a sudden my body reverted back to the eating habits I maintained when I was seriously working at losing weight!  That is, I'm not hungry around lunchtime and really only need a light meal and a medium dinner; nothing else for the day.  This is a HUGE contrast to what my food habits were for the last 8 months when I wasn't exercising.\n\nAnd so onto my question:\nTL;DR:"}

Yet we're still together. She has no idea of the differences we have sexually.\n\nI know that both the long term plans and sexually incompatibility are the context to bring up the subject with her, but I don't know how much to disclose to her regarding my sexuality.\n\nI imagine as soon as I say that \"Sexually we're incompatible.\" she will ask \"How do you know that?\". Its here where I run into problems; how much do I disclose? Do I explain what I fantasise about / masturbate to? Do I go into specifics about these fantasies or do I keep things general? Do I tell her I still use pornography even though we almost broke up about that subject twice / years ago?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Have you ever been in a situation that was rapidly going from bad to worse, and you found yourself taking control (or helping) to ensure everything turned out all right?\nPOST: I was at a baseball tournament for my little brother this weekend (future MLB player, I'm sure) and it was a pretty exciting game. Balls flying everywhere and kids swinging sticks while I sat watching, eating my chili cheese fries. \n\nAnyways, here's the situation that I went through: a mom of one of the kids was trying to get a good picture of her son as he went up to bat. She scaled the fence near first base and was about 4 feet up off the ground. Her son hit the ball, a dribbler near the pitcher, and ran to first. The pitcher barehanded it and shot it to first base but overthrew it. The ball went straight at the moms face and smacked the camera back. \n\nShe fell back and her head smacked the concrete, like when a baseball bat makes good connection with the ball. I don't know why I did, but I knocked over my chili cheese friese (R.I.P.) and rushed over, along with one of the parents, who is a doctor. She was sprawled on the blacktop and her glasses were shattered, along with her camera, and there was a thick stream of blood coming from from around her left eye. \n\nHe assessed her and said she had a concussion and it seemed some glass had gone into her eye. He made me control the source of the bleeding, a huge gash above her eye (shit was crazy, yo) as he got a pair of tweezers, disinfected them, and pulled out the glass he could see. When the paramedics finally came, they complimented (mostly to the doctor) the extraction of the glass, otherwise she might have lost the eye waiting to be treated at the hospital.\nTL;DR:"}

We live in different cities and only see each other on weekends.\n\nThis weekend he went to his friend's birthday party on Friday but we made plans to meet on Saturday. On Saturday morning he sent me a message that he needs to postpone our date a bit since he's still at the party but will go home soon. 6 hours later he texts me apologizing that he's still partying and is gonna stay there but I'm welcomed to join.\n\nAt that point I was so pissed that I didn't even answer him. I called him but he was so drunk I don't think he even understood why I was mad. I tried to ask him if he has any other suggestions besides me coming there and he just said no. Then I told him that we'll talk on Sunday.\n\nToday on Sunday I went there to talk to him about this and how it's not ok what he did. I told him I think it's beyond rude to cancel plans with your own gf that you only meet on weekends anyway because you can't control your drinking. He apologized and genuinely looked like he was sorry but the only explanation he could offer was that he got carried away with partying. And he couldn't promise me that stuff like that will never happen aggain. I asked him whether he even wants to be with me anymore and he assured me that he wants. I left it at that and now I'm writing this.\n\nI'm at loss right now... Is this kind of behaviour forgivable or acceptable? He made me feel like I was overreacting when I started crying and told him that I feel he doesn't seem to care about me. I was thinking of breaking up with him over this but I couldn't in the end, because he hasn't done stuff like this before and, well, I still really like him. Am I overreacting?

Also, would it be common courtesy for him to warn me when he has a lot of work and therefore isn't going to answer the phone? \n\nAfter this happens I get upset, and he's says he just forgets to make sure his phone is on or he's busy and forgets to call.

He was in the same group of friends as my girlfriend and they were very close friends before they started actually dating. He and my girlfriend dated from seventeen until shortly after college. But he's still a pseudo member of the family, because he was her brother's best friend and her parents' extra son long before he was her boyfriend. \n\nHe and my girlfriend are still friends. My girlfriend says that when they ended the relationship they both made the decision to continue to be friends rather than avoid eye contact at every single family event. I understand this, but she still has a close friendship with this guy. When I talked to her about it, she stated categorically that he was as much a part of her life as one of her brothers and I better get used to it. \n\nI haven't seen anything to make me think that either one of them wants to get back with the other, but I'm not in their heads. I trust my girlfriend not to cheat on me, but I do wonder if any part of her still carries a torch for him. Either way, the amount of history between them and the level of emotional intimacy kind of gets to me. \n\nAnd it doesn't help that his parents love her ex and her mother harbors a somewhat secret desire to see my girlfriend and her ex get married and give her a dozen grandkids.

A little over a month ago we hung out in a group and he brought up new years and told me he had thought it was cool (wat) and that he \"thought we could hang out.\" Since then we've hung out one-on-one several times - going to fun events in the area, going out to eat, etc. He invites me. We hang out just us with another couple pretty frequently.

It's fun. \n\nThe thing is he hasn't made any kind of moves... we haven't even kissed or anything, we just always hug goodbye.

I like him a lot as a friend/person and if he's not interested I don't want to make it weird... not to say I wouldn't be disappointed, but I'd be happy, not heartbroken, to have him as a friend, too. I'm just worried that I don't seem interested, or that he's just shy and is waiting for some kind of \"ok\" that I haven't given.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Anyone know how to pay off a car loan without early termination fee?\nPOST: I took a car loan in april 2012 and I signed the agreement that said that if I were to pay off the loan in less than a year, I would owe them $100.00. I now have enough money to pay off the remaining balance and still have money left over for a rainy day fund. The question I have is basically a logic question and how interest is calculated.\n\nThe interest on the car loan was 4.19%. Currently I'm paying about 50 dollars each month in interest. Obviously that tells me that it'd be better off to just pay off the loan than pay $50 each month till April. Looking at a daily interest calculator ( seems to tell me that I can game the system a little bit. If I do a payment and keep the remaining balance of about, say 10.00, it says that I'll owe 1.78 after 155 days; much less than the $100 payoff fee. The question is, is that legal?\n\nIn addition, without looking at the loan agreement, is there some way of determining that I have to continue making my same loan payment each month until April 2013 (or can I just stop the auto-draft and pay $12 at the end of April 2013)?\nTL;DR:"}

Previous to the weight-loss my weight was at the top of the healthy range, maybe a little above.\n\nFor the past several months I haven't been experiencing hunger in ways that I have previously. These symptoms aren't constant, but often times I don't feel hungry, or if I do feel hungry, I don't feel motivated enough to get something to eat. Also, when I do eat, food doesn't taste as good as it did before.\n\nThis seems to me like symptoms of mild depression rather than some kind of eating disorder, but I don't feel depressed.

I had spent the morning bird watching just outside of town, not working so I just wanted to do something. Anywho was driving back through the city when I noticed a bird of prey called a Australian Hobby. Not something you expect to see in the city so I pulled the car over on a main road and started observing through my binoculars it in a quite low branch over a field.\n\nNow unfortunately this field happened to be occupied by a whole bunch of primary school children (6-12 yo) on morning break. I was too interested in the bird to really notice that overlooking a field of young children with binoculars was very very suspicious. Not to mention I was on the side of a four lane road.\n\nAfter about thirty seconds sirens went off right behind em which scared away the bird and as it was at that exact moment I realised I had fucked up. Two coppers jumped quite aggressively out of their car and start yelling what the hell I'm doing and I just sort of squeaked out \"birdwatching\".\n\nSeriously I was shitting myself and it was kind of clear that they didn't believe me. It also didn't help that I didn't bring along my bird book so I couldn't show them that as some evidence.\n\nSo I just decided to start naming all the parrots of Australia by there common and scientific name in a vain hope that they would believe me, and thank Christ one of the coppers went on Wikipedia on their smartphone after about 15 seconds of me doing this and realised I knew what I was talking about.

The conversation was very light, mostly about our jobs and school. She wasn't sending my any one word texts or any other hints that she wanted to stop talking and it was midnight so I just assumed she fell asleep.\n\nAnother month passed until yesterday I planned on texting her and planned on asking her to dinner or something so I began with \"Hey how are you?\" around 10 pm and didn't get a reply. I'm not sure if I should pursue further or forget about her. She hadn't started a text conversation with me in the whole time I haven't texted her. \n\nI really like her and would want to go on a date but I don't want to be some creepy persistent guy who she needs to tell to fuck off. I just feel like if she was really interested she would text me back. From what I've seen shes pretty glued to her phone so I would think she would have seen the text. It's strange because she hasn't really given me any signals that she's not interested in me besides not texting me, like in class she would strike up conversation with me and everything so I don't think that she thinks I'm a creep. So I guess my question is, should I try texting her again (and if yes than what should I say?) or should I take a hint and forget about it? It's just really disheartening because I'm a really shy and self conscious person who finds dating really stressful, and this was the first time I was able to get the courage to even ask a girl for her number, and it might be a few years for me to be able to try again. I'd say I'm 99% sure I'm not going to text her again, maybe I'm just looking for some reassurance that I'm making the right choice, or if someone thinks I'm giving up to soon.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I still miss my ex and can't get over the heartbreak...\nPOST: Hello Reddit. This might be more of a 'me venting' post than anything, but any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI am a 21f and my ex is 24m. We dated for a little over a year and a half and although a large portion of that was LDR (we lived a couple hours apart while we attended college, but I graduated and he is finishing his final year) we were very close and loved each other a lot. I felt like he was my best friend as well as my boyfriend. In the end he called it off because he said that a breakup was inevitable since there was no end in sight to the LDR portion. He said he still loved me and that it was a difficult thing to do, but he thought it was best for us both. I didn't agree and wanted to make it work, but he felt he needed to be alone. Or at least not be with me.\n\nThat said, it has now been about a month and a half since we broke up. I am still not over it at all. The first couple weeks I was extremely depressed and upset all the time, but now I've sort of learned to live with it. I can be normal around my friends again, but at night or whenever I'm alone I usually end up crying and thinking about him and how much I miss him. I'm always thinking about him and how he is doing and just wondering about his life even though now I guess I'm not supposed to care. I've done all of the things you are supposed to do after a hard breakup \u2013 keeping myself really busy, working a lot, hanging out with friends as much as possible. I even started volunteering at the humane society to work with shelter dogs. All of this helps but it doesn't dull the pain of missing someone who you can't stop loving but also can't have.\n\nPlease Reddit, have you been in a similar situation? What helped you? I've heard that time heals all, but is that the only cure to heartbreak?\nTL;DR:"}

Can I have a little advice?\nPOST: A bit of back stories needed but to save you the wall of text I'll keep it as short as possible.\n\nBasically me and this girl met online and got really close, we were pretty much together, kind of in a relationship (was going on for about six months). I went down to meet her a couple of times too. Thing is we kind of drifted apart during exams last year as we're so far away (2/3hour train journey). Then came summer we never really got talking again. We're both 16 if it's relevant at all. Anyway over the summer she got a boyfriend and now I'm back at school and studying for my A-Levels, but she keeps messaging/texting/dm-ing me saying she misses me or she was listening to my favourite band and she thought of me etcetc. I'm not sure what to do, am I just being vain in thinking she shouldn't be doing this, or shouldn't she?

I had terrible acne, godawful social skills, and the few chances I had in early grades I messed up due to inexperience, which caused a ripple of \"FFFFUUUUU\" my whole highschool time. I had zero luck with girls.\n\nFastforward to now. I'm 20 years old, 2 years out of highschool and I am now going to highschools regularly to teach kids in an afterschool program (I don't want to be to specific). I've done a bit of growing up. Worked out, got a suitable haircut, cleaned up my skin, got style, and most importantly, got status. For what I teach, I am considered a legend by some in this town. Also, for what I teach, a lot of the highschool girls are babes.\n\nGet where I'm going?\n\nI have so much pent up attraction for girls ranging in age from 16-18 ish from getting absolutely nothing in highschool, and now all of a sudden they're practically throwing themselves at me on a daily basis. According to the rules of my job though, I'm not supposed to interact with these kids outside of these classes. Also, I feel like society in general is frowning upon me, a 20 year old second year university student, doing anything with a girl in grade 11 or 12.\n\nIf I don't do anything now though, as this is potentially the last time I can (I feel like 21+ is just, not allowed), will I just go mad? This has been at the forefront of my mind for like, a month though, constant thought on \"is this okay? is this too wrong?\"\n\nThoughts Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

I was just wondering if it was normal to every now and again, though very rarely, feel slightly nostalgic for single life? \n\nI love my SO with everything I have - he means the world to me - and I would in no way EVER want to trade being with him for the single life, but I guess after 18 years of single life I'm taking a little time to adjust. I don't miss anything like wanting going out drinking and hooking up with randoms or anything, it's just little stuff, such as having heaps of time to myself (I'm a huge introvert/homebody) or not having to consult/think of anybody else's feelings when changing things about myself (\"Will I be less attractive to him if I...?\"). \n\nSo yes. In no way do I want to be single again - I want to spend the rest of my life with this man - but just sometimes miss some aspects of how life was for me beforehand.

Another time, when we were working together in a company small event, I could sense her looking at me in the most \"I want to know you\" way. So you can say our interactions were fairly ordinary and within boundary.\n\nTruth be told, I think all those talks and looks are not sure signs that she is into me. I'm fairly confident that I am not needy to a point that I read everything as a sign(most of my colleagues are female and I am quite comfortable in front of my female friends and female strangers). But she was like the first one that captivated me after a few years. I find myself wanting to talk to her badly. But as she left just after 10 days, she may be uncomfortable with anyone at my company (me included) and now I'm quite clueless.\nTL;DR:"}

Very loving relationship, we were long distance for two of the three years and I always trusted him.\n\nFor about a month after we broke up we were still hooking up and he was telling me that he loved me. I spent my birthday weekend at his place (Thursday-Saturday), and dropped by unexpectedly on Sunday to grab a jacket. Walked in on him watching movies with another girl in his room, he claimed they were just friends and I believed him. Less than a week later they were dating, I was furious, and we didn't talk for a month. He broke things off with her and has been trying to get back together with me since then.\n\nHe has always been adamant that nothing happened between them physically and that she was the one that initiated the dating and the relationship. I believed him. Two nights ago we went on a bar crawl and I took care of him and brought him back to his place. I got him in bed and noticed his FB was open. I am not proud of what I did next, in fact I am downright ashamed of it. I went through his messages and discovered that he had been hooking up with the girl he briefly dated and me at the same time, and that he had initiated most of the contact between the two of them.\n\nI confronted him in the morning. He reacted violently, grabbed my arm and physically removed me from his house, leaving bruises. He has been back and forth all weekend yelling at me for betraying his trust and then apologizing. I am at a loss for what to do. I know I shouldn't have been on his FB, but at the same time I feel better knowing the truth. I dunno, I guess I just needed some outside perspective on what happened.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by asking my coworker if she had a mother\nPOST: Firstly I'd like to point out that I haven't been in this town long. I came here to study and with studying comes a house and bills and beer. All of these things cost money. I've been surviving so far off my student loan but after some calculations I noticed that my financial forecast wasn't looking too healthy. I sought to remedy this situation through applying at several local ale houses and advertising my self taught vocation as a bartender. Lo and behold one of the first places I applied at called me back in a rather short space of time and offered me a trial shift. 'Smashing' I thought, as this usually means \"the jobs yours unless you're a total fuck up\". Which to the best of my knowledge I'm not. The trial shift went well, I buzzed around the place collecting glasses, quickly took to the bar and found my way around the till (cash register for the yanks) with relative ease. Then came the after work drinks. One of my fellow coworkers (let's call her Sally) had been drinking in the pub for most of the evening having not been on shift that night. We were all sat drinking round the bar and I was attempting to put up the whole confidant and witty front without attempting to come across as arrogant.  Sally's language was becoming increasingly more profane as she got more and more drunk. As a witty and hilarious interjection I piped up with \"Sally, do you have a mother?\" with the intention of bringing light to her liberal usage of the c word. My question (although slightly rhetorical) was answered not by laughter and acceptance but by utter silence and Sally bursting into a flood of tears. I thought best not to inquire further into Sally's mothers whereabouts and instead quickly finished my drink and left. I imagine the best course of action now is to seek further employment elsewhere and hope that Sally will never (through sheer chance) happen to be my future employer.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [32/f] My boyfriend [38/m] only says I love you during sex (a little NSFW)\nPOST: Sorry in advance for the long back story but think it might help understand the situation. I met my boyfriend about 2 months ago. He lives across the country and we recently met up and totally hit it off. I think he is the one and I'm pretty sure he feels the same way. So about a month after we met, I was visiting and while we were having sex he looked at me and said that I was it for him and that he loved me. I didn't say it back because I felt scared for some reason (commitment issues). So about a week later he is visiting me and he asks me (during sex) how much I like him. And basically asks me if I love him and I say yes. Then, the next night we are laying in bed and he is getting emotional about leaving and says \"I love you\". And I said \"I love you too\". And it was nice. That time actually we weren't having sex when he said it. So last night we were on the phone getting into sex talk (phone sex) and he says \"How much do you like me?\" and for some reason I just can't say I love you that easily yet, so he asks me if I still love him and I say yes. And it TOTALLY turns him on! I understand that that level of intimacy for some people is a huge turn on but I'm concerned that he doesn't really love me and just says it as a way to get himself turned on when we are having sex. And the truth is that I do love him, very, very much. Even though we have only known each other a short time I know this is it for me. So, I guess the advice I am looking for is should I believe him when he says \"I love you\" since it is only during sex and not other times? Why not during romantic times when we are on the beach or after a nice dinner? Either way, it doesn't change the way I feel about him, I am totally smitten. Thanks in advance!\n\n[\nTL;DR:"}

When I met him he was very skinny, but his face was cute and I really liked his personality and the fact that he paid attention to me (i've never received male attention before).  While in college he put on about 20 pounds and it made him look a whole lot better.  He still wasn't overweight by any means, but he just looked not so scrawny and filled out his clothes better.\n\nHowever, he gained the weight because he ate a ton.  Now he doesn't do that anymore, he'll grab food and not eat it because it either makes him feel sick, or external stress affects his appetite.  I'm the opposite, food is a source of comfort to me (probably why I'm overweight).  He won't eat food if I offer it, or he'll just nibble at it to be polite.  He's lost almost all the weight he gained over this year, and seeing his hipbones and ribcage have me wishing he'd just keep his shirt on during sex.  Before you ask, I had never seen him naked when he was previously skinny, as we weren't sexually active then.  Obviously I've never mentioned anything like this before to his face, I know I'd hate to hear it if I was him.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I guilt him into eating.  I'm not proud of my behavior, but I feel like unless I focus on how sad he's making me feel and how I feel like a whale next to him, he won't finish his plate.  It bothers me that outside stresses (and he has a lot of them) affect his appetite on a daily basis.  I feel like his mom sneaking more calories into his food (if I cook, we mostly eat at the dining hall) sometimes.  \n\nHow do I get over my insecurity?  Is my boyfriend as unhealthy as I think or is my fatness clouding my judgment?  Should I just stop eating with him?\nTL;DR:"}

Basically I'm not comfortable with another guy spending more time with her than me, nor do I like another man being there for her when she's emotionally vulnerable (say, if we have an argument or something, but those are few and far between).\n\nIs it unreasonable that I'm not comfortable with this situation?  I'm really at a loss here\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: I could use some help with my calorie intake..\nPOST: Hey guys! Awesome sub here! I just signed up for the most recent 12 week challenge as I am looking to drop a good bit of weight over the next few months!\nAnyway - I've been watching what I eat and cutting out snacks wherever possible. There used to be a LOT of snacking, some of my meals would e replaced with large snacks..\nHowever, every resource I use be it loseit.com, livestrong iPhone app or fitness trainers at my local gym tell me that I should be eating near to 2500 calories per day with my current exercise routine. The problem I seem to have is that with trying to cut down I can't really get over about 1500, give or take 100 on either side. I feel like I'm cheating if I eat anything to help \"bulk it out\"\nMy question really is, should I worry about the extra? \n\nThanks in advance!\nTL;DR:"}
