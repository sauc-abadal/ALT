We got married shorely after I graduated college and things have been really good.\n\nI recently graduated with a form of medical degree that I worked really hard for. Bert was really proud of me for it, too. He didn't go to school, but he's been working in a famous kitchen that people travel to come see. He loves the people there, and I do, too.\n\nI work at a hospital in the pediatric wing. I recently got asked to move to New Mexico to work in the pediatric wing there. The job offer sounds amazing and we have always talked about trying new things. The job offer also offers a 45k raise per year. (Texas pays the lower end for my career) I told Bert immediately. He wasn't excited though.\n\nI have until February 1st to reply to the offer. They call me everyday, really excited for me, thinking I won't turn it down. I haven't let on about my issue.\n\nBert doesn't want to leave his job. I understand this one the most. I know it would be a major bummer to him to have to leave behind the guys who taught him all about cooking since age 17. But then he goes and says things like, \"I thought we agreed to stay here forever.\" I never agreed to that. We both said we wanted to try different city environments out. He'll say, \"You don't need that. You should just stay here. It won't be anything different to move to a new hospital.\" New environment, new patients, new problems, 45k raise. He wasn't even impressed by the raise. He just scoffed that 45k wasn't much and we wouldn't need to do anything with it anyway.\n\nHe's never once even asked how I feel about my new promotion, never asks about my job at all, and only ever talks about his career. I feel neglected. I need advice. Am I wrong? Anyone have any perspective? Been on his side or my side?\nTL;DR:"}

( It damn hurts, because I think feelings is the only thing that matters in love). \nThe age problem is even more serious recently because she is finishing her 1st year in college, and I will start college after 3 months.. she met the guys there and she formed some good relationships with both genders, I'm ok with that, but in this April I traveled with my family, and for the first time we start texting on What's-app, so I noticed she is not engaging that much in our conversation.. she gives short answers, she doesn't bring new topics \"when she can\" also she rarely expresses her love for me\nI started to think she lost her interest on me.. because I'm not really attractive, the age is a turn off to her.. and the distance is making it even worse. So I asked her one time: If we go back in time.. would you fall in love with me again?\" .. she said: \"No.. It had nothing to do with you, but the circumstances\"..... now you judge\nTL;DR:"}

Being the caring girlfriend that I am, I went out and bought him a bunch of cans of his favorite chicken noodle soup and left it on the counter for him with some other gentle foods so he wouldn't have to bother digging around for it. By the time I got back, boyfriend's flu (and most of the soup) was gone, and all seemed to be well. \n\nAt least until today.\n\nBoyfriend decided he was going to have some more soup for dinner tonight. When he opened the can he immediately grimaced and started gagging. I asked if he thought it had gone bad (odd for canned soup, I thought), and came over to smell it for myself. Just normal noodle smell, as far as I could tell. He decided to heat it up anyway, even though he claimed that the apparently nasty smell persisted. He was hesitant to try eating it, so I took a test bite first since the smell hadn't bothered me. The crackers he put in were a bit stale, but other than that it seemed to taste normal. He took a spoonful and didn't even try to chew before walking to the sink to spit it out. Then the horror dawned on him.\n\nHave you ever eaten a specific food when you're sick, only to find that the smell and taste instantly make you nauseous from that point on? This had never happened to my boyfriend before, but I'd described the phenomenon to him after experiencing it many times myself. He was heartbroken when he realized this is most likely what happened. Let me be clear- this guy absolutely *loves* chicken noodle soup, and hardly eats any other kind of soup at all. And now it's completely inedible to him.\nTL;DR:"}

She was apparently apologetic\u2014it's just her \"personality\" with everyone\u2014but I know that isn't true.

Advice?\nPOST: Here's the story, I apologize for the length: \n\nI met this girl many years ago (5+ years) in an online game when I was a kid. We became good friends and being the na\u00efve boy I was, I started to \"like\" her. I told her how I felt, but she politely rejected me saying that we don't know each other in real life. I knew she was absolutely right (She could've been anybody!). After that, we laughed it off and continued to be friends. After a couple years, we stop playing the game and exchanged emails to keep in touch. \n\nFrom here we would occasionally send emails a few times a year (birthday, Christmas, how are you, etc) and it would always be a surprise that we still remember one another. I went on with my life and she went about hers; I really didn't think about it much anymore.\n\nLast year, she found me on facebook and I didn't know who she was at first, but I recognized her name. This was the first contact since over a year (our last email exchange). The first time we saw how we looked and of course, we lived very far apart. We messaged occasionally throughout the year on facebook.\n\nNow she has started messaging a lot and we actually got to know each other. More so than the last 5+ years I would say. Old feelings don't die I guess.. and now I think I am falling for her again. \n\nFor now I am trying to take it slow and enjoy these moments, but at the same time, I don't want to lose the momentum we have right now.\n\nI am lost on what to do. I can't tell how she feels and I don't want to push her away, but I like her. I'm afraid to tell her how I feel and get rejected and unfortunately end whatever we have now. She is really awesome and its one of those rare times I just have this gut feeling about someone, someone who I haven't even heard their voice yet!

I felt my heart sink right then, she did a second test and left the room. An I sat and waited, my eyes were watering but I kept telling myself the test must've messed up. Then she came back in with her manager and I knew, and I cried as they were telling me I tested positive for HIV.\n\nI need to tell my partner, please don't read this and think I won't. I'm going to tell him tomorrow and take him to the clinic. I'm just scared, was it me, was it him. I wish I could be angry, or hurt but I'm just so numb.

Ive gone to psychiatrists and hospitals for 20 years now, and while I have a few close friends that understand, I've only ever had one good relationship, with someone who understood but never judged and didn't see me as the illness.\n\nTragically, I lost her a year and a half ago to breast cancer, and I've been increasingly reclusive since. While I've never had the best social skills to begin with, I'd started to develop more anxiety the last while than ever before, and while I'm getting it under control finally, the thought of how to meet new people scares me to no end.\n\nI'm at a point where I am genuinely happy with who I am and while everything I've gone through and still go through with my mental illness has shaped who I am, and is a major part of me and my life, I'm wanting to meet new people and start dating, but I'm not sure how to go about it. It's not the idea of meeting them that scares me or makes me anxious but rather the complete not knowing how to go about it, how to meet people with the same interests and such, and how not to ruin it immediately,  that makes me terrified.\n\nWith my ex, we'd met by chance when I'd intervened to stop her ex from harassing her, but I'm not sure how to just meet someone or initiate things normally, how much I should mention of my own issues, anything like that, and I feel socially retarded because of that utter unknowing.

My boyfriend's father is big on doing his own renovations and manual labor, but he often asks me and my boyfriend for help doing things which are outright unsafe. For example, heavy lifting with not enough people, installing gyp-rock on high ceilings using rickety ladders, wheeled scaffolding on 2x4's over stairwell, etc... (think /r/osha)\n\nAnyway, me and my boyfriend hate to say no, especially to my boyfriend's father since if we don't help he'll probably find an even more dangerous \"solution\". In fact, I can't think of a single time when either me of my boyfriend has said no, no matter how dangerous the situation. The other day though, I injured my shoulder during one of these escapades, and it's not the first time. I'm just worried about everyone's safety in general. Is it wrong for me to say no in these situations? And my boyfriend too?\n\nI also want to clarify, I have absolutely no issue helping out so long as the situation is safe. I do, however, have a lot of trouble saying \"no\" when I'm asked to do something I'm not comfortable with. And anytime I bring up the safety issue, I just get a \"Don't worry, it's fine!\"\nTL;DR:"}

I have never been in a relationship before him. He is very committed and often speaks about us having a future together.\n\nOver the last two months we have been constantly fighting over how much we should be talking to each other daily, hanging out alone rather than with friends, reluctance to attend each other's family functions etc. \n\nA lot of these fights have been due to me feeling overwhelmed and panicky about our relationship. As more time goes on, I am not sure if I am ready for all this. However, I do care about him a lot and want him in my life...\n\nI want to ask him if we can slow things down a bit, and hang out together without all this added pressure. But I am unsure how to go about this without him thinking this is a precursor to us breaking up. Of course, if he wants to break up then I will have to deal with that. Also, if he agrees, I have no idea how to negotiate with him on casual boundaries, or even what they should be. He has never had a casual relationship and will struggle with the idea. I do know that he will require exclusivity.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice as to how to go about this? And how have you handled casual relationships yourself?

But I figure if you dislike a character or narrator the author is doing a pretty good job, just as good of a job as if you enjoyed, I'd say. But after seeing several amazon or goodreads reviews of the exact same nature, there seems to be a good portion of readers who absolutely cannot bring themselves to like a book if they cannot like the main characters.

What was the real reason for her her facebook password change 3 days ago?(Her reason: If I can't have yours, you can't have mine) I never had a problem not having her facebook password, I never have a shit, but now I'm paranoid. What is she hiding? I've began questioning the past, during our first year she talked to her ex. She claims nothing ever happened, that they never met up. How can I know?\n\nHonestly I don't know what the fuck is going on. I just have this weirdest feeling. I don't trust her anymore, I don't believe her anymore.\n\nI hate this feeling. I feel like a detective searching for all kinds of clues. My mind is occupied by this most of the day. I hate who I'm becoming, controling and snoopy..\n\nI'm thinking about letting her off because a few more days of this I'm gonna chop my head off.

I had a moment last night talking to my friend where I broke down and really felt all of the pain I've dealt out and received. I'm not happy with myself as a person (cheating and other issues in my family has kind of left me empty). I'm not as strong as I project.

I'm not happy. I want to be a single mother. I need to know what I can do for myself instead of relying on someone else. I have to learn to be strong in my own right. I can't pretend anymore that I'm happy with who my husband is or that I'm happy being who I am today. \n\nI want to grow and be something better, but I can't do that with a partner. And again, I'm not in love with him anymore. He's caused me a lot of pain and I've caused him a lot of pain and keeping up this face is wrong for both of us. \n\nHow do I tell him that I need to leave? I tried before and he became irrational and made me out to look like a bad parent for wanting to leave. I'm not a bad parent, but I am a broken person.

I kept saying okay we can stop until marriage, but give it like a week or two and she initiate it, I'd ask are you sure? And we went through with it.\n\nWell fast forward to about 4 months ago, she thinks its best if we go on a break to focus on our faith, so then we can have a more Godly relationship. I thought that was a bad idea and we can work on that and still be together but we didn't. We would talk and see each other occasionally. Last night at 10 she texts me to come over to talk. When I get there we don't talk, she wants to go to sleep and have me spoon with her. She just said she missed me and wanted me there.\n\nIn the morning she leaves early for work. And I know this part is shady and wrong, but something doesn't feel right so I check her facebook. (Rewind, before she announces this \"break\" she told me a male friend of hers kissed her, and she kissed him back, but it didn't mean anything and that she was sorry. I forgave her, but she kept hanging out with this guy, so I had concerns) I pull up her conversations with him to find out that, they had sex together and hang out all the time. There were many messages that were like \"I wish you were here\" or \"come over.\" So I am freaking out, I call her at work, said we need to talk. Ask her repeatedly for the 100% truth of what happened with her and this guy during the break. She said they kissed a couple time, but they aren't together, and that she doesn't have feelings for him. I don't know what hurts worse the lies or the cheating or the hypocrisy.

I believe he was also planning on spending a significant amount of the following year abroad as well, but this is no longer part of the plan. I live 2 hours south currently, with my parents, as I'm taking a year out of University due to personal issues (largely to do with where I was living previously), but in June I was planning on moving back up to live in what is currently his room, everyone in the flat was OK with this, and we'd discussed it at some length.\n\nSo that was the situation for some time, and the deadline for putting down a holding fee for the lease was the 20th of March, which of course I did. However, I can't actually sign the lease until I've paid a 3 month advance rent, and have not yet finished the details with the landlord. \n\nThat was the situation until apparently today, when I was contacted by one of the two others currently living in the flat to say that A had informed him he now wants to stay in the flat next year (it's a 12 month contract). So this puts me in the particularly awkward position, I haven't *actually* signed a contract, so the flat isn't mine until I pay this money, but equally I am quite in need of somewhere to stay, and I dropped previous plans to move elsewhere because of this opportunity. Like I mentioned, a significant portion of what caused me to leave University for the year was my living arrangement, and I was counting really on being able to live somewhere stable with friends. \n\nI'm not 100% sure of the situation, and will edit this when I know more, but if anyone has any advice/questions I'd be keen to hear.\n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

Now that the DNA testing has came back and they motioned for child support, I need to tell my fiance.\n\nI've been scared and visibly stressed out by this. I don't know how to tell my fiance  about this, and how she'll take it. \n\nGuys/gals, how should I break this news to her? How should I go about informing her that my salary is going to be cut by almost 30%? \n\nDo you think she'll still want to marry me? \n\nShould I attempt to have a relationship with the child? My ex has stated that she wants nothing to do with me.\n\nPlease help. I don't know what to do! :'(\nTL;DR:"}

I specially dread doing group projects because I don't have any friends/don't know anyone in my class and I always feel left out, can't find a group of my own, am the last one getting picked. I start having panic attacks every time a professor mentions them, sweating, feeling like I might throw up/pass out, it's awful.\n\n  Now the case in question: there's this one class that has two major group projects. I was out of town while they divided all the groups and, since no one knows me, I'm not in any of them. This happened about a month ago. I only found that out after I came back, this week, while speaking to the professor before class was supposed to start, and he said we would wait until class started so he could talk to everyone/see if there was any group that would accept me. \n\n  When he said that I immediately started having a panic attack, imagining him mentioning my issue in front of the whole class, and maybe not getting any response from other groups, just being met with awkward silence, so I excused myself and left. I couldn't stay there, I felt sick.\n\n  So now here I am, still no group, thinking the professor probably sees me as a horrible student who would just skip class, but I don't know what to do. I need to pass this class. I'm debating explaining my issue to the professor but I don't know how understanding he will be. I need advice\nTL;DR:"}

I don't get to see her often (every few weeks, for maybe a few hours because she can't leave her dog, because of the snow etc etc) and she takes a bit of an issue with one of my best friends, it's the only friction we have, everything else is fine.\n\nIn the past me and this friend have attempted to make a relationship work multiple times over the 5-6 years I've known her, and it just hasn't worked for multiple reasons (both mine and her fault) and communication breakdowns, but she was/is an amazing friend when we're not \"together\" and someone I would like to keep in contact with as she doesn't have many friends and neither do I.\n\nI have tried explaining to the girlfriend that we have had something in the past, but now it is just a strong friendship between us and she seemed fine with it. However whenever she's brought up in conversation (\"what are you up too?\" \"just on the phone\" \"with gemma?\") the girlfriend goes \"off\" with me for a few days, especially when I go home from university and the friend comes to visit (she's from my hometown) - me and the friend talk maybe once every few days, so it's not like I give the friend more attention than the girlfriend...\n\nThe girlfriend always says things like \"I know I can't stop you seeing her\" which to me seems like \"I really wish you'd stop seeing her\"\n\nSo reddit, what do I do here? I feel like I can't cut a friend of 5+ years out of my life as it would be unfair and I really like having her as a friend, but then I also feel like this is going to be the death of my relationship unless I can do something about it, the girlfriend says she trusts me but she clearly doesn't on this issue. At the moment I just try to avoid bringing the friend up as much as possible, but I feel that's a patch on something that needs more.\nTL;DR:"}

I have asked him a thousand times and even gotten a little snippy but nothing seems to work.\nTL;DR:"}

It's been incredibly hard on my four siblings and I. It nearly destroyed my mother. She's gotten stronger everyday, but we're still right in the middle of an incredibly ugly divorce. I've gotten past the point where I'm sad all the time, but it's still very hard.\n\nThroughout this process I have had my boyfriend of 4 years. He has been amazing and wonderful, and always there when I need him. I know this has been hard on him too, because we are both close with each others families.\n\nThis brings me to three days ago, when my boyfriend's father dropped the bombshell on his family that he has been seeing another woman and will be leaving them. His whole family is being destroyed in the same exact way mine was nearly 2 years prior. You would think I would know exactly how to comfort my boyfriend but I don't. I felt angry and upset at first, but now I feel weirdly detached. I almost feel scared of going through this entire process again. And even though he was there for me every step of the way, I am afraid I can't be there for him. A part of me doesn't want to go through the hurt of my family being broken apart again. Because I know exactly what the next 2 years look like for us now, and it's bad. And I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way.\n\nTo clarify, I am not leaving my boyfriend, I love him with all my heart.

After five months of dating, he told me he loved me and it was reciprocated. A year on, we've faced some challenges, but have helped eachother through them; ie: my stress with work, his need to scale back his drinking. We finish eachothers sentences, love eachothers friends and have a mix of hot, tender sex as well as the kinky, experimental variety.\n\nWe are talking about the future, did we (as individuals) want to get married? Have kids? I'm really proud of him recently for returning to college to finish his degree and he has a new job which he is hoping will provide him with some security, but the fact is, he has no savings at all and up until now has lived pay cheque to pay cheque.\n\nI hear that some couples just go with, \"our money is OUR money,\" but I have to admit, I'm not totally cool with this. I've worked so hard for my financial stability and I realize that divorce is a business for a reason - because plenty of people thought nothing like that would ever happen to them.\n\nAside from that, I'm just concerned about other things, like the fact that I can afford to do things when I feel like it, and he can't. We do so much together, that I don't feel like it's an issue now, but I've loved having the money to go overseas when I feel like it, and I don't expect him to be able do to this.\n\nIs it naive to think that the money thing is no big deal, so long as we are compatible in all these other ways?\nTL;DR:"}

We used to all be part of the same group of friends, but I went no contact with my ex over a year ago after he flipped out and began harassing me upon learning I was dating someone new. \n\nBy harassing, I mean he hacked into my FB, erased messages, contacted my new BF with threatening messages, showed up drunk at my apt uninvited, and sent hundreds of messages/calls even after I threatened to go to police. I even got his mom and a lawyer involved as the harassment lasted months and I constantly worried about running into him (we live in a small town). I also had to cut off a few mutual \"friends\" who turned out to be feeding him information about my whereabouts and my new guy.\n\nSo the question is: should I attend my friend's wedding? He already told he me expects to come to this special occasion and that he doesn't want the past to get in the way of me and my BF showing up. He got really upset when I hesitated in giving an answer immediately.

He looked really dorky, he was tall, bald and missing the upper part of his right hand pinky; the latter earned him the nickname of *Cotton Swab* amongst us students. Yeah, we were dicks.\n\nOn his first day in our classroom (it wasn't that big, we were 18 students) he tried so hard to look like the \" new mean teacher around\" that he started kicking out of class almost everyone for the most stupid of reasons. There were about 12 people left when he saw me talking to a friend of mine, and he said: \"Hey, you at the back, sit 3 desks forward from where you are\". I knew I wasn't supposed to be talking in class so I respectfuly stood up, walked to the third desk infront of mine, and sat down, just like Cotton Swab said.\n\nInstead of carrying on with his class, he kept silently staring at me, and so I respectfuly -again- asked: \"Is everything alright, professor?\", to which he replied: \"Do those look like 3 desks further up to you?\".

I stood up, pointed with my index finger to each of the desks behind the one I was on, and said \"One, two, three, fuckface\".\n\nThat incident got me expelled for a week in which we had a Math test and that subsequently led me to failing the assignature itself.

I felt like it should've been here at 415pm so I headed back to the mailbox to see what was up. Our copmlex mailbox has three doors on it and a metal flap over the top to protect the box from rain. That flap was ripped out of the brick wall and placed on top of the wall. Then I noticed behind the trashcans, which are next to the mailbox and Apt #101, a cardboard box that had been ripped open. Next to it was a string of plastic bubble packaging. The box had my name on it and the address was from Woot returns.\n\nNeither of my complex neighbors were home, so I went to knock on the doors of the people in the complex next to us and no one was home. I called mom and she said go to the post office. So I did, and I waited for 45 minutes to talk to Mike, our NEW postman. He has been on the route for 3 days. He explained that he placed it next to our front door, behind the wall that leaves it out of sight. The post master explained that without insurance they can't refund my money and so I need to contact the website and the police, since our mailbox was vandalized.\n\nI just finished filing a customer support request with Woot and filing a police report online (per recommendation of the lady on the non-emergency number I called). We have lived here for a month and I have had a total of 4 packages delivered to this address so far. All were placed near the front door and out of sight and were undamaged when I received them. If I hadn't been at work today I would have been able to take the package when it was delivered, but alas, that wasn't the case. I doubt that I'll get my money back, and I doubt that I will find another tablet to purchase for that price. The only reason I even bought it was because of the great price on it. Sigh.\nTL;DR:"}

The school was something like $7000 for the 1600 hour course. We put $2000 down and were put on monthly payments for the remainder. \n\nImmediately it was obvious the school was a joke. She probably should have withdrawn then, but we stuck it out. She was older (26-27 at the time) than most of the girls there (17-19) and the drama was a bit unbearable. The owner of the place had no control over the constant shitshow this place was. She continued to go there for about 1000 hours, leaving 600 left to completion when she could no longer bear it and quit.\n\nIn their contract that she signed, there is a clause that dictates how much refund you are entitled to if you quit early. It states that if you complete 50% - 100% of the course, the institution is entitled to keep 100% of the tuition. I assumed that meant we simply cannot get a refund.\n\nApparently, this means that they can sue us for the balance of the full tuition. So, they're suing for $3300 + $800 interest + $400 or so in court costs/attorney fees.\n\nThere has got to be recourse for us in this. I feel there has got to be someway to argue about the quality of education she received. Or something to the effect of how their entire clause talks about refunds, not tuition being due in full if you quit. The rate at which it ramps up is amazing. In the schedule that shows the percentage earned by the school, once you complete 1% of the hours (two days of attendance, 16 hours), they are entitled to 20% of the tuition, or roughly $1400...\n\nDoes it not matter how ridiculously asinine a contract is, if my wife signed it we're screwed? Is there a way out of this? I just feel helpless that because of a signed piece of paper a school was able to get away with shitty service, nothing gained what-so-ever, not only not give a refund for the quality of education received, but ALSO sue us for money that they absolutely never earned and have no reason to try and collect other than the contract says they can.\nTL;DR:"}

She can get angry at me for not bringing flowers randomly (I watched a musical she attended, the day after she whooped my ass for not congratulating her with flowers afterwards, didn't even know you where supposed to do that), not doing things she always wants etc.\n\n I try to please her as much as I can but at the moment we barely even kiss anymore. She make more time for her friends than for me (I respect that she doesn't always want to see me). This have been going on for three moths now and I'm starting to get frustrated, maybe I am selfish when I say that I want sex, I want to feel loved and at the very least I want empathy.  I'm sorry if someone have problem understanding, English isn't my first language and I'd be happy to explain further if there is any misunderstandings. Take notice that in this I am ofc very partial. Tell me if I'm doing something wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

Do you think this will last?\nPOST: We started dating when we were in university 10 years ago. Over the 10 years we went from couple to FWB to not speaking for a year to FWB again then to being a couple again then not speaking for two years then being friends with benefits again.\n\nWe get along really well. We just \"get\" each other.\n\nCurrently, we're best friends with benefits. He acts like my boyfriend when we're together, and we occasionally have long conversations online when we're not physically together.\n\nAfter years of manipulation and drama, we finally learned that the best way to have a successful FWB setup is to be vulnerable and just let ourselves fall in love with each other. We're also more mature now. No more insecurities and playing games. So now, I have the perfect FWB relationship with him. My gut says this could progress to a real relationship someday. But I'm so afraid it will end because of the times we split up in the past. He's the love of my life.\nTL;DR:"}

He's just so supportive and the definition of a total bro. My best girl friend (let's call her 'Jenny') is everything I could ever want in a girl: smart, religious, funny, and kind. Anyhow...\n\nI started texting Liam while at a dinner party for my parents, super bored. He, like a total bro, recognized I was bored and suggested that we play 'Would you rather?\". We did this for 20 minutes before deciding to be risqu\u00e9 about it. All that means is that we ask 18+ questions, for you sheltered folk.\n\nWe got on the topic of Jenny, who Liam knows I like a lot. His question was: \"Would you rather sleep with Jenny, or sleep with a Victoria's Secret model, and why?\"\n\nI answered with banging Jenny. Hey, we're 18 year old freshmen. Don't judge us.\n\nAt the same time, I was texting Jenny as well, and the worst thing I could imagined happened...\n\nYup. I sent the message to poor Jenny.\n\n\"Dude, Jenny has an amazing body. I'd totally sleep with Jenny.\"\n\n\"UM, EXCUSE ME?!\"\n\nWell, shit. This sucks.\n\nI ended up calling her and telling her that the message was totally out of context and not even meaning what it should. Hopefully she doesn't know.\nTL;DR:"}

My girfriend and I recently moved from our own personal apartment to a slightly bigger palce with roommates. Our Cat (A Tailless Manx) was the only animal there. Our room mates have dogs but they very rarely come anywhere where she can see them. This alone would not be too much of a problem. I would understand if she just needed time to get to know the new place. The main concern is that she has holed herself up in a small cubby in my bed and has barely moved since we brought her here.

He also told me he didn't really know what it was at first, and thought he had some sort of skin condition. He stated he was going to start staying over at other people's places in order to avoid the bed bugs. I have had bed bugs before, and had to have a full blown move, with chemical treatment, and all my possessions and furniture held. It was probably one of the most stressful, and horrible experiences I have had. I still get anxiety every time I get a bug bite because I worry it's from bed bugs. I am especially allergic to the bite, and they swell up to the size of a baseball. \n\nI have tried to tell my roommate what precautions he needs to take and that he should consider calling an exterminator, or land lord in our situation (California).  Especially since it has been a month or more since he has gotten them. He continues to brush me off, and tells me he plans on vacuuming his room in the coming days. Our rooms are right next to each other. I even recommended him to check his bed seams, and he brushed me off and left the house to stay at his parents last night.

This is my first boyfriend and I feel like when ever I go over to his place, there isn;t much to do. My idea of dating is all from country songs and romcoms, so I imagined we'd be talking all through the night every night, joking around, or we'd put on the radio and start dancing and singing. Or we'd talk and get an idea to learn something new together. Or we could just walk around outside and be silly. \n\nI also don't know how to feel about when we go to parties, because I feel super single when we go to parties. He doesn't dance unless it's meringe or bachata, and in general there isn't much hugging and goofing around together.

It was fun, but I don't get how this was any different than if I just came to the party by myself. \n\nAnd one more thing is I don't know why, but he doesn't seem to be a fan of ANY PDA.

He is into what's called Total Power Exchange, where he controls every aspect of the slave's life 24/7 (what she wears, how she looks, how she speaks, what she does, etc.) What's more is that he's into something called Bimboification, where a girl undergoes plastic surgery to basically look like a blond bimbo (collagen injections, liposuction, breast enhancement, etc).\n\nThis makes me feel sick anytime I think about it. To make matters worse, I feel like a total hypocrite as my wife and I have been in the swinging lifestyle for the last 3 years. We are only out to 2 people one of whom is this friend. This is the reason he told us as he felt that we would at least be open minded about his lifestyle. Unfortunately we are far less open minded than we thought as we are both pretty put off by this whole thing.\n\nIt's also made me question how open minded people would be towards us if we came out to them.

We took a break and started again the summer before I left to another state for college, beginning what became a 4.5 year long distance relationship. She was always my best friend, and while things weren't easy while we were apart, it was like that same head over heels highschool love whenever we were together. After I graduated, I stayed out of state and she was finishing her last year of college back home. Arguments that we'd had throughout the relationship escalated in frequency and magnitude, with both of us realizing we were different people. After drawing out the inevitable for almost a month, we broke up. Dealing with it, I isolated myself from her for almost a month to take care of my own sanity. Eventually, we talked again to kind of see how the other was doing, and honestly we were both doing better apart.\n\nTime passes, and she admits through text that she was kind of hurt that I was doing so well without her. I'm not the person to kick someone out of my life unless they've seriously wronged me, but I told her that I had realized the breakup was more mutual than I had thought at first, and that helped me get over it. \n\nSo more time passes, we chat occasionally, and she's getting ready to graduate. She wants to move to NYC (where I live) to start her career, and asks if she can stay at my place temporarily until she finds a job/apartment. I want to say its okay as long as its temporary (hopefully less than a month) but we'd be roommates, sleeping in separate beds in the same room. Additionally, I think she may have been in another relationship since we've been apart, and the thought of that fills me with anger that she would even ask such a thing of me. But, for the time we spent together, I don't want to deny her the opportunity to start her career because I feel like I owe her that much.\n\nSo what should I do reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

He plays quite a bit in the house (which will turn into a problem as he gets bigger) and plays a little in the back yard.\n\nHe refuses to go out the front or garage door (towards the cars) at all costs. I'd say this is probably due to the minor wreck that he and I were in. Poor guy flew into the floor. Before that, he was still really skiddish around cars, but now he just refuses to go near it.\n\nI try exercising him during the day but he doesn't like being outside. If I carry him out there, he just sits by the front door. I've gotten him to play a little and even run with me around the block but he is never too interested and always ready to be in the house.\n\nNote: this is all if I open the front door or garage door. I could leave them both open over night with him loose and he wouldn't go out of them. He has no problem with the back door.\n\nHow can I fix this. I'm a pretty active person and I really wanted my dog to run with me while I ride my bike and skate. I was expecting him to naturally enjoy the outdoors and I'm really worried he won't be to excited about the water. :/\nTL;DR:"}

We were out to dinner with my younger brother [15M] and while I was driving out of the parking lot, a country song came on. My boyfriend was in the back seat, and he started saying he didn't like the song and to turn it off so me and my brother jokingly turned it up. He started yelling and I thought it was funny so I was like \"this is my jam!\" but he got so upset that he opened the car door (while I was driving in the parking lot) and got out. \n\nThis made me freak out and get a little scared because I'm a fairly new driver still (only have had my license for a year). I told him to get back in and then proceeded to over dramatically lecture him and I told him that I could just take him home, even though his car was parked at my house. He stayed quiet for the rest of the ride home and all seemed to be well.\n\nThen, when we got home, he said \"I wanna go home now\" when we had planned on hanging out after dinner. I was like \"wait didn't you wanna hang?\" to which he replied \"not really. You were lecturing me.\" I was really confused because I didn't mean it as that, and he said \"I don't like being fucking lectured\" (keep in mind, this is all in front of my brother).\n\nAfter that, I felt like just letting him leave, however, I asked him to talk to me and we talked things out. He expressed that he was mad that I wouldn't listen to him about the annoying song and how he didn't like me lecturing him, and I expressed how I didn't appreciate him bailing from a moving vehicle and making me upset. \n\nWe made up and are on good terms now, but I'm really confused about the whole thing still.

The actual break up was very messy as he tends to act very childish when things dont go his way.

We go and have our introductions to the classes and teachers etc.\nSo about halfway through I'm talking to the popular kids as I was coming in from a different school with primary extended for a year. One guy in particular is pretty nice so I get his MSN to hang out and stuff.\n\nA few months later...\nSo yeah he was friendly at first, but turned into a complete asshat from here on out he will be known as Assholio (Or AH for short). So the past few weeks he had been getting on my nerves by flicking my ear, purple nurples etc. So he decides to bend my wrist and punch it. Now i haven't mentioned this yet, but he's my size and a lot stronger. I've seen him beat up kids who punched him straight up in the face. Anyway I've decided I've had enough. Time to retaliate.\n\nThe Revenge: \nSo we have these tables during break and you just dump your bag wherever you want to. So AH abandons his bag as per usual and goes off to find a target. When I'm sure he isn't looking I pick up his bag and put it in some other group at the bottom of the mound. Now these piles were huge so if you didn't know if your bag was in those piles you would be absolutely clueless. So end of break and we all take our bags and go to class etc. I sometimes stayed to watch him get frustrated as the area emptied and he still can't find his bag. \n\nSome days I'd leave his bag alone as not to get him asking questions, because I'm a horrible liar. This continues on until I made the mistake of doing it once too many some months later. AH asks me if I was the one moving his bag around and I say \"Yes AH I was the one fucking with your bag you might wanna consider quitting bullying. It'll save you from a lot of detentions.\"\nHe hasn't bullied me or anyone else since.\nTL;DR:"}

My partner of a yearish, is basically at her breaking point when it comes to how frustrated she is with how introverted I am.\n\nI've been in a few serious relationships and openness has always been something I struggle with. I don't feel like I'm ever able to communicate effectively.  Whenever we have a serious conversation I find myself freezing and unable to construct a sentence.

I don't get hyper-emotional and break down, I just turn to stone.\n\nIn addition to that, I find it very difficult to bring up difficult topics. If something is bothering me in our relationship I usually try to think it through on my own to figure out how I can resolve it. I know that I am the cause of our basic issues of communication and trust so I feel it is my responsibility to resolve them.  But because I keep all of those feelings inside, she no longer trusts me to make her aware of issues.

Not just a bit upset, actually devastatingly sad - she sounds like someone died when we talk to her on the phone. I think she was hoping this would be a phase and then her daughter would go back to \"normal\" and the wedding is destroying this fantasy.\n\nObviously this weighs heavily on my fiancee's mind, she is not particularly close to her mother but it is her mum after all.

Neither of us made a move, and we had a really awkward talk about her not knowing what she wants/leaving for college soon/never had a boyfriend/just wants to lay in bed alone and play her 3DS while eating Doritos. Which I understand, because I am the same way. We're going to separate colleges. I thought the cuddling would be awkward but it was actually pretty great, and Emily seemed to like it as well. We've talked since, but we haven't talked about it, and it's really bugging me.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by enjoying pancakes too much\nPOST: So both of these stories happened around 3 years ago, like most of the posts on here.\nSo it's a Saturday morning and it's just me and my brother in the house because my parents were working. My brother is an early waker, so he is usually up by 6:30 or 7. Usually he just plays video games or watches tv, but today he decided to be super nice and he made pancakes for himself and me. This was a very pleasant surprise for me because by the time I had woken up, (around 8:30) there were pancakes awaiting me on the kitchen table. My brother had already eaten and he had left me 4 or 5 pancakes. Granted, they weren't the biggest pancakes in the world, but I'm a bigger guy than most, so I just finish off the plate. When I finish eating, my brother asks me in a concerned voice, \"Did you eat all of those pancakes?\". And I was like, \"Yeah, they weren't that big, so I just finished them off\". He then proceeds to inform me that he had made fiber one pancakes because that was the only batter that we had. For those of you who do not know, if you have a lot of fiber in your system, you will have to shit... Badly. And that is exactly what happened to me. I went to the bathroom 5 times that day, averaging 10 minutes on each sitting. Needless to say, I hat in as not a fun day at all.\nTL;DR:"}

She accepted my friend request, to my surprise, because I thought she didn't know my name. Anyways, after scrolling through her Facebook, I realized that I really do like this girl and I'm hoping for a relationship with her.   \n\nAnyways, I know I need to at least strike up a conversation with her to have anything of a chance, but I have absolutely no idea of what to say, considering I didn't even think she knew I existed. I guess my question is what should I say to her over Facebook without ever having talked to her in person before?\nTL;DR:"}

She made the choice to move down here this week and it's been 6 days now that she's been here living in my apartment while she gets on her feet. She got hired at a local bar and is now currently looking for a place to live. \n\nSo that's the story, I like her, I've told her I like her. She has replied in kind, but she tells me that she isn't really looking to date at the moment. She is incredibly independent, has had an interesting life causing her to need to be so. We've talked about her independence and if there is any future for us. The answer is always I don't know, but she is wiling to see how it will play out. She tells me that she enjoys being single, that her friends all know her as singlesuzy. I'm not sure what that means, or maybe I don't want to know lol. \n\nShe told me that she moved here because of me, honestly that makes me feel good.

He is one of my closets and dearest confidants, and has in the past gone through a period where he used heroin. It was a dark period in his life, and he got help. It was a LONG road,and he has been clean now for nearly 7 years. This friend and I talk everyday and see each other multiple times a week. He has a professional level job, college education, and he has his life together now. He has a solid foundation, everything he would need to convince him not to do this sort of thing. I don't want him to throw everything away for this. \n\nHis wife died about 4 years ago and I know that he is reeling still and mourning, but I thought he was doing better with it.   \n\nLast night, a friend of ours got married, and, of course, he and I were there. I danced with him and it was hot in the barn so he sort of rolled up his sleeves a bit and I noticed what I think were fresh track marks. \n\nIt took me and the rest of his support system 2 of the longest years of our lives to get him clean. I remember very nearly wanting to walk away, and having him stare at me and say \" I don't care what you do.\" I can't go through that again.\n\nI have asked him to sit down and talk with me about something, and he thinks it is regarding a current situation I am going through. I plan to bring it up then. \n\nQuestions: Should I confront him alone? Do I take another friend with me? I would hate to tell other people when I am not 100% sure myself. \n\nI am not physically frightened of him, but I sort of feel like having someone else there might show him more support, maybe. \n\nHow do I approach him about it without accusing him of using again? Should I even bother being worried about that? I mean him being safe and healthy is much better than him being uncomfortable, right?\nTL;DR:"}

I fell in love with her, we lost our virginity to each other, and we were together up until July of this year. She broke up with me (not completely out of the blue we did have some difficulties but not anything to immediately give up on the relationship). \n\nThe next time I saw her was around Thanksgiving, by then she had already found a new boyfriend(how about D), actually less than a week after we broke up. When I saw her we talked about what happened in our relationship and she told me how she was unhappy with her new one. Eventually she told me how she was going to break up with him the next time she saw him. She swore she never had sex with him and stupidly I believed her. Things got intimate. She broke up with him some time in the first couple of weeks of December. \n\nOn the 16th she started dating yet another guy unknowingly to myself. I met with her this last Thursday and we saw the hobbit together. She told me about this other guy(lets go with G) and how she had feelings for him but she had much stronger feelings for me and has always had feelings for me. For some damn reason I believed her.  \n\nCouple of hours ago I went through her facebook messages because she was still logged in and I noticed a message from one of her exes. What happened was while dating (D) she had sex with me during thanksgiving, then while dating (G) she had sex with me again and before that I believe she had sex with either (G or an ex). \n\nI'm done with her I kinda knew that since she broke up with me, but I feel conflicted as to what to do now. Should I tell (G) or just leave the entire situation?\nTL;DR:"}

Since then I've been showing her affection and interest - over the internet, phone, nothing face to face. \n\nRecently I suggested to meet up for a date since she lives in another part of the country, to get to know eachother properly and see if we actually fit rather than just doing this internet thing where its impossible to truly know someones personality.\n\nShe was hesitant, no problem, lots going on for her. Now however she expects me to talk with her for hours every day or she's upset. I am to devote time to entertaining her or she will be upset. She always wants to know where I am, or if I hang out with any women. I dislike being tied down like that, especially since we have yet to even meet up.\n\nOn one hand, she argues that if I'm interested in her, it should be natural to care deeply about her and that I should embrace all those demands happily. On the other hand, I feel like I'm stuck in a relationship cage already but without any of the benefits of feeling loved, kissing, spending quality time with your SO, that butterfly-in-stomach feeling. None of that exists. Only expectations. In which case, I really want to \"break up\" already before anything could even happen, which is upsetting because me and her are similar in many, many ways. So far I'm flooded with negatives however, with almost zero positives.\nTL;DR:"}

We go there about twice a month and have become very friendly with one of the waiters. Today we started talking about his home country of Tibet. We learned that 3 1/2 years ago he fled Tibet with his wife and three children. He showed us pictures of them...gorgeous young wife...three beautiful children (2 girls one boy :) ) Unfortunately his wife and children went to India and he hasn't seen them since. He has been working to get them here and is going to be reunited with them in a few months as they have been granted asylum!!! (YAY!). Hearing his story broke our hearts. They had to leave  because they do not have even a fraction of the freedoms we do. So we really wanted to do something big, and special, to help welcome his family to America...which will surely be a culture shock for them. Especially where we live which is a sleepy little tourist town on Cape Cod.\nSo I naturally thought of how amazing reddit is and we think it would be awesome to have a \"Welcome to America\" gift basket to give them when they got here. If anyone has any good ideas let us know. Or if you want to donate to this PM me.  We have been given a lot of generosity in our lives and I want to pay it forward.

Cool.\"\n\nAlmost immediately after my first deposit, the rate fell to 1.10%, to which I said, \"Dammit - that's lame, but whatever... at least they still have the highest yield. OK, not a huge deal.\"\n\nNow, their rate has fallen to 1.00% just before the fed has promised to introduce rate hikes, and they no longer offer the highest yield. I feel like I've been duped, and while the difference is pretty much pocket change given my meager savings in that account, I'm really feeling salty about the change. \n\nSo, we'll see if and when they raise their rates again, but I'm definitely now in the market for a new high-yield savings account. I'm don't think I'm going to close my account with MySavingsDirect since there's no minimum or fees (and that could reflect poorly on my credit report, I think?), but I'm really thinking about it.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been seeing my boyfriend seriously for 8 months. We go to the same uni, but are long distance for the summer. We have a pretty great relationship other than a few problems, and he tells me he loves me/is in love with me, and I truly love him. He's the first guy I've ever been in love with. \n\nNow to address the problems: I suffer from depression and anxiety. Sometimes I freak out and have these little break downs where I become sure that boyfriend doesn't care about me. We broke up at the beginning of summer because of this, but agreed to get back together if I learned to stop freaking out and taking everything out on him. I have done a fantastic job by getting this under control, and he's told me this plenty of times. I do freak out sometimes, but it's few and far between. Today I relapsed, and had relapsed over a recent vacation we took. I freaked out and started saying he didn't care about me. He just ended it. He told me he didn't want to be with me anymore. \n\nThis was heartbreaking for me. I knew I'd messed up, but I never thought he'd just end it. I cried, and we talked about the issues. He told me that he didn't want to break up as long as I was willing to keep working, but I'm still so hurt. This isn't the first time this has happened. I feel like he's asked me to change (which I'm totally okay with) but he's not being patient enough for the actual change to take place. I feel like having relapses is going to happen when you're used to behaving a certain way, but I feel like anytime I have a relapse he's just going to abandon me. \n\nI told him we were still together but didn't know if it was going to stay that way because I feel very angry about the situation and feel like I just got thrown out like yesterday's garbage. I guess I need help on whether or not I should stay with him. I'm in love with him, but he makes me feel like I'll never be good enough.\nTL;DR:"}

Then just 2 years ago, I was in her debut and she fucked me up real bad for being an insensitive woman. I swore that time that I have already given up on her as a friend and as an ex-lover. Plus, she had a boyfriend that time, so it didn't really matter to me anymore. She's now in a far-away place and that made it easy to forget.\n\nLast month was her birthday. A common friend of ours tipped me to try and reconnect with her. I did reconnect with her and things were really bright for both of us. She's single, and our conversations went more frequent although we did not express our feelings to each other yet. However, I will be going to that far-away place where she is, and we have a date set. This will be the first time we'll see each other again right after the ruckus 2 years ago.\n\nIt's not hard to mistake this as another chance to get back to her. I never expected things to look this bright. Am I fooling myself? Am I being too hopeful? the other thing is that this may probably another semi-long distance relationship.

When he invites me over, he's usually on his computer playing games. Usually this isn't an issue, because I enjoy video games, but lately he's playing too much or spending all of our time together upgrading his PC or playing new games. If I want to go out or invite him over to my house, he gives me shit for it, saying he's \"too tired\" because he stayed up too late doing whatever he does. Now, the new WoW expansion is out, and he's blowing money on it. He doesn't even have the money to play, but he's doing it anyway. Aside from that, we had sex about four times this past month. It used to be almost every night. When we do get to spend quality time, it's usually when he's too tired to do anything but sleep, and it's only for about an hour, then he sends me home so he can sleep for work. He usually gets off of work at about 5:00pm, and doesn't say anything to me until about 7pm (he used to text me all of the time).\n\nI don't know what to do.

So, I try not to talk about that around him as he just overall seems to think he's better than it. However, he does go to see the films and has a rational, thought-out and overall positive opinion on most of them. It's all very confusing and frustrating. Besides this, he's a nice guy. A lot like me in the way he is quiet and into film and television.\n\nOne night, we were talking over Facebook and I could tell he was getting fed up of my opinion on the new Avengers 2 trailer. We stopped talking for an hour or so, and I decided to cheer him up with a joke on how 'The Jonathan Ross Show' had a poor line-up, to which he snapped-in quickly, exclaiming how he didn't give a fuck about that show, before I could finish the joke. I lost it. I pretty much called him every name in the dictionary and shut down my laptop immediately.\n\nA couple of days passed and I was still quite angry with him. I checked Facebook, to see several replies from him, ranging from angry, to apologetic. I still ignored him. A week passed. And then a fortnight. Now a month, and counting. I don't know if I can, or for that matter, should reply to him.

Well, someone threw mine away and I need your help, Reddit. (My birthday is tomorrow...)\nPOST: This probably won't get enough attention to really do much, but it's worth a shot.\n\n[My Bambi] my Velveteen Rabbit, if you will- I received him 22 years ago on April 22nd, 1990. I was two days old. He went with me everywhere, he went with me through me being adopted twice, through the birth of my daughter, through me being homeless for 14 months, through me losing custody of my daughter(for being homeless), . I had him up until August 2009. It was then that a friend's abusive ex boyfriend threw him away. Now, this is where I need your help- the woman that gave me Bambi, passed away when I was just an infant. Through the years his tag was cut or ripped off so we never knew what brand he was. I really want to find a replacement for him. It's been almost 3 years without him, and I'm doing just fine- but I would like another Bambi to give to my [daughter] He probably won't mean as much to her as what he meant to me, and it will not be entirely the same, but it would really mean a lot to me, Reddit. You guys are miraculous at finding things-please help me find the manufacturer, brand, anything and everything. Aside from the pictures, the only other information that *might* be helpful is that I live in Oregon, and so I can only assume that is where the woman that gave me Bambi bought him. Also, Bambi was a name that I gave him as a child, I do not believe that he is in any way Disney associated.\nTL;DR:"}

I like her a lot, but I have a hard time expressing my emotions. On the other hand, my gf is pretty emotional and tells me she loves me all the time. Whenever I show even the slightest sign of annoyance, she starts to cry and tells me to say \"I love you\" to her for her to get better. If I don't say it, she gets even more upset. But I just don't want to throw that phrase around because I dislike saying it in a forced way. It doesn't help that whenever she starts to cry because I'm annoyed, I get even more annoyed. So I was wondering if I have a right to be annoyed at this or if it is my fault for not appeasing? \n\nAnother example of her emotional personality is when we were watching a documentary on a guy who took care of his comatose gf and dropped everything like work and school to do so. My gf then asked me if I would do the same and I straight-up said no because I couldn't afford to do so, as I'm still in college and young. She then started crying and got upset at me because I \"don't love her unconditionally,\" even though this was a purely hypothetical question and had no chance of occurring. Was I being a bit harsh or was she being irrational?\n\nI mean, I still like her a lot, but she is super attached to me. She wouldn't mind losing all of her friends and giving up her entire social life if it meant being with me 24/7, and I just can't do that. I need to have my own interests and other friends where I'm not with her. It's getting to the point where she wants me to take her to all of the kickbacks/ parties that I go to with my friends and she gets upset when I don't involve her with them.\nTL;DR:"}

But what about capital appreciation?  Isn't it always better to pay the taxes up front if you are young and assuming your investment will compound at 7% for multiple decades.  In other words, even if tax rates are much lower in the future, you will pay less taxes on the smaller initial investment with the Roth as apposed to getting taxed on your fully appreciated portfolio when you retire.

She's turning 19 soon so we're around the same age. And it was a really fun conversation, we each were laughing and I enjoyed it. Then fillings started, and when it was done it was pretty much leave the room and get another appointment, don't even say bye or anything to her. When I talk to the secretary, he tells me that I need to do my 6 month cleaning soon, which I had done today. I go in today, get my room, and while I'm waiting, she sees me and comes over. She asks if it's ok if she does my cleaning today instead and of course I say yes. And while she's preparing we're talking a bit and she remembers some of what we had talked about last time. She does the cleaning, dentist comes in, checks, then leaves. As I'm about to leave the room, we're talking and she goes \"aww I don't get to see you for 6 months now\" and like an idiot I act like I don't hear her because her mask was still on she just says oh that happens sometimes, doesn't repeat herself, and then we say bye an I leave. Go home, feel like a failure for not even asking her to coffee or something, etc. So I guess I'm wondering if it would be weird/creepy at all if I went back to the office sometime soon, ask if she's there, then ask her out?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [26m] with my ex [27f] of 3 years, why is she still talking to me?\nPOST: The long story short, my girlfriend and I broke up after living together for 1.5 years, and living in separate states for ~1.5 years when she took a job out of state. The distance took a toll on us. There was one incident where she deleted text messages from her iPad before she let me borrow it. I wouldn't ever compromise her privacy, and she knows this. I've had a few other issues with trusting her prior to this event, but all events, this one inclusive, have been more or less swept under the rug. This tid-bit is an irrelevant rant, that feels good to get off my chest. None of these issues were cited during the break up, but I feel that this could have slowly contributed to the stress-ball that eventually turned into our relationship. \n\nI mostly credit living apart with the break up. Neither of us were really happy, and it was hard. I was convinced that I could keep it up until the next step, where we would be able to move in with each other again, but we never made it that far.\n\nShe broke up with me a few weeks ago. I took it on the arches, more or less, and kept it cool because we still very much have a life together, until she moves her things and her kitten out. We share the same circles of friends. I will see her again in my life, but I don't want the relationship to relapse. I feel a bit betrayed and abandoned, considering the sacrifices I made to make the relationship last while she moved. I'm certainly not bitter about it, and I can imagine us being friends eventually. But for the time being, she chats with me and tries to re-enter my life after putting out the flame less than a week ago. \n\nI don't know if this is her insecurity, regret, or oblivion to the reality of the situation. I sincerely doubt the latter, and fear the former. In my opinion, we should be doing our own things right now. But if she is constantly seeking consolation and reaffirmation of my well being after the break up, should I be worried?\nTL;DR:"}

I started getting ready for class then my friend wanted to show me their new bong, and i was like \"Sweet yea lets rip it quickly\" we go to blaze and we ended up ditching school, i went back 5 minutes before the end of the day, teacher tells me to wait outside, and i wait outside, 15 minutes later, teacher walks out and yells at me, \"We can talk about it now! or we can talk about it later!\" I said, extremely stoned, \"Yea we can talk about it now!\"- Dumbass mistake i made, he was so choked at the fact i skipped school to get stoned, my buddy that was with me got caught too so we where in the office. my teacher said to me \"what did I tell you I'd do if you started playing school again?\" , I replied with what he told me. \"If I start playing this bullshit program you'll kick me out.\" Stoned and frustrated i knew i just fucked up, he immediately replied with a fast driven \"And that's what I'm doing right now\" Boom, out of school, well fuck.came home mom is bitching at me and i have to get a job by the end of the week.\nTL;DR:"}

I was smoking $20-$40 worth of weed a DAY (stealing from my moms purse to pay for it). I stopped going to school or if I did I would just sit there and do nothing. After trying and failing to quit a few times, I realized I would have to make a complete life change. I couldn't keep hanging out with my friends that would just sit around and smoke weed all day every day. So, I stopped hanging out with them, and actually ended up graduating early. \n\nAt that point though, I had pushed away all my sober friends and so I had zero friends at all. It didn't bother me so much because I had plans to join the military, and decided to just make a fresh start there. Another long story short though, that didn't pan out. (I ended up having 5 surgeries in the past year). So, here I am, a 19 Y/O male, who has no friends, isn't going to college (and no plans to. Don't try to convince me to go, I'm not. I have other plans for a career), isn't going to the military, and currently works a job that is filled with other stoners.

To be fair, I've told my boyfriend in the past that I wanted to see this band and venue with him. But I didn't expect it to be on my birthday. Also, he can't afford tickets for both of us, so I will be paying over $300 for my own ticket, which would mean I couldn't afford my hobby related present.

So i can either go with them and attempt to find a IT job in Arizona or i can stay at my current employer and finally be truly independent for the first time in my life. I have about $15,000 in a saving account as an emergency fund. I also put about $50.00 a paycheck into a Healthy Equity account which is a non taxed account that i use for paying my Health, dental, and vision with ( i have $1,000+) in this account so if i have any doctors visits it will not come out of my bank account directly. I make 17.40 an hour and i bring home 2,000 a month and am paid bi-weekly. My only monthly expenses that i pay directly out of pocket and does not come out of my paycheck is my car-payment and insurance which i pay ever 3 months. as well as various reoccurring purchases (gym membership, Netflix, etc..) I have two credit cards and have a very good credit score for my age i would say. After all is said and done and \"Current\" monthly expenses come out to about $500 Dollars a month excluding credit card bills which normally is not a lot. that gives $1,500 left over each month for my self.\n\nNow Down to the real question: How much of a percentage is worth putting towards an apartment or what should my range be? or what percentage of your income do you believe is fair to put towards an apartment.  Apartments in my Area range from ($600 - $1200 a month) Help me PR i feel like i am doing everything correctly financially but i still have no idea WTF i am doing!\nTL;DR:"}

I told her up front that I had had bed bugs in the apartment I had lived in before I studied abroad for a year in Germany but the entire unit (all flats in the house) had them as well and I had since been bed-bug free and destroyed all previous items in the bed bug infested apartment.\n\nI have lived in a dorm in Germany for a year and for a few months at my parents' house since then and I clearly have no more traces of bed bugs.\nI also don't understand how I can be held accountable for the bed bugs. I mean, if they were looking to buy the unit or maybe if I had been landlord at the infested unit and was applying to be landlord for them, then it would be more valid I suppose. \n\nBut I don't think it's fair to judge a tenant with a good tenant history (no evictions, rent always on time, no major losses to security deposit) for the problem. It seems unfairly discriminating.\n\nI have no other options of places to live and I need to be in the city for school! \n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

There's a girl in my class who, on the second day, sat next to me and was my lab partner for the day. We were supposed to do the lab work on our computers. A few minutes into fumbling around she starts crying and freaking out because she can't figure out the labwork (neither can I, but her response is extreme). I try to calm her down, but she freaks out until class ends. I never learned her name or any details about her.\n\nFor the past few weeks I've just made sure not to sit by her, which is not a good solution, because she's been having these anxiety episodes pretty much with every lab. During lab everyone works with their own partners and just pretends she isn't actually sobbing. I had a brief summer job with mentally ill kids before and if they did something like this I would maybe leave the room with them and help them practice their coping skills, but I don't have the authority to tell another student to stop doing the lab and leave the room. She asks for help and breaks down in front of the professor in class, who does not know how to deal with episodes like these (although that isn't her job).\n\nI feel like I should help her, but I don't know how or who to tell. Maybe I should stay out of her business, but her episodes make everyone in the room uncomfortable and it upsets me to see someone like this. I also worry about these disruptions affecting my grade because the class is particularly hard for being only 2 credits.\nTL;DR:"}

There are some reason why, such as she can't afford the train tickets (whereas I have my student loan) and she rarely has phone credit (though even a text would suffice).

We went through a lot of life changing things together (the death of family and friends, the pains of growing up, sexuality, emotional pasts etc.) \n\nTwo weeks ago I moved back to the states for college. We had seriously talked about the situation and both decided that we were ready and willing to try for a LDR. He was never one to really express feelings but two days ago he approached me saying he needed to talk about emotions. We talked about how hard it was to be apart, and how much we love and care for one another, and how, though we were young, we both wanted a future with each other. However, the conversation took a turn and he said it was to difficult to stay in the relationship at long distance. So it is over.\n\nWe have both restated our love for each other but the break stays the same.

I sat next to her and began asking why she's sad. My mom explained to me how she feels extremely unappreciated around the house and how she's starting to feel unwanted, and has no one to talk to. She gave me a few examples of what my dad and I have done lately and I really did feel bad, so I apologized. My mom and I are fairly close so she was accepting, but she finally broke and told me how she feels like my dad is just downright negative towards anything she does. I have noticed for quite some time how my father has become more aloof towards my mom and how his jokes become more and more insulting towards my mom (IE: Calling her greedy when she offered him some cake but gave him a slightly smaller piece) and she can't really handle it anymore.\n\n Normally people would have someone to talk to, but we are a small family of 3 and have no relatives at all that live on the same continent as us. So we have to fend for each other and it seems to be taking a toll on my mom. She asked my dad if he wants to exercise, go to counselling, church, etc and he responds with how he's too busy with work to bother (we recently moved houses, he's paying for half my grad car and supporting family back home) and he doesn't have time to waste. My mom thinks he's being overworked since he's always doing overtime to the point that she thinks he thinks work is more important than anything else at this point. I offered to my mom that I could talk to my dad about how he's making mom feel horrible and unappreciated (even when she does a lot for us, with a huge smile to boot) and try to talk it out with him. She said that was a bad idea since he would get mad that she vented to me about him and she wants to avoid it. I'm not really sure what to do, I feel like my dad would get mad if I confront him, and if I let them go about it, my mom will start to sink into depression at this rate. What can I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My ex-girlfriend [20/F] broke up with me [21/M] just broke up with me and I'm having trouble getting over her\nPOST: My ex-girlfriend [20/F] broke up with me [21/M] in the early morning hours of November 1st. To give you a little background, the relationship had been a little rocky before that. We had issues where I asked her to be a little more affectionate and she claims she was continuously trying (which I appreciated) to appease me, but it wasn't good enough for me. However, I wasn't content and kept communicating with her about it and it lead her to become unhappy. Combined with the fact that she felt that I treated her poorly in public and didn't take responsibility for my actions, it drove her away. We continued to try to work the issues out until she reached her breaking point and decided to tearfully break up with me. Lately her friends tell me that she has been stressed with school and hasn't had time to think about the breakup. For the first 5 days, I've been going no contact, but have been thinking about her constantly. Today, one of our mutual friends asked her how she felt about the breakup and she said that she feels that she made the right decision. However, she advised I talk to her about it. Therefore, I stupidly broke no contact and called her to meet up to talk about things. She said it's best we didn't meet up, so that we can focus on ourselves. Furthermore, she said she doesn't want to lead me on and we can't be more than friends. Therefore, I responded that I'm going to have to let her go because I'm not fine with being friends and still need my space. I feel like if I had been more appreciative and worked on my issues, we wouldn't be in this predicament. I'm just so sick of hoping that she'll change her mind. I don't want to feel hope, I just want to improve myself and get better, but right now I'm having trouble doing that. Does anyone think that I still have a chance to get her back if I perform no contact? Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

She accepted and told her we could both come, because she was never really close friends with this girl, so if she's asking her she must be kind of desperate for people to invite. However, my girlfriend forgot that I already had plans to go to an event on the same day at the same time.\n\nI reminded her of my plans and she apologized for forgetting, but said that I would have to go since she already RSVP'd for me. I told her I wasn't happy that she RSVP'd without asking me first since it's someone I don't even really know and she hardly knows, and asked her if she could possibly call her back and tell her I couldn't make it. She said she wouldn't because she'd feel really bad since she acted so excited when she told her we could go. She also said she doesn't even really want to go either, but is basically doing it because she feels bad for her.\n\nSo the bottom line is that I don't want to go because I'd have to cancel my previous plans, but my girlfriend is telling me I have to. I already do stuff like this with her *all the time*, so I feel like one day to do what I want isn't asking for much. If this was her best friend or something, then yeah, I'd understand.

Also, two nights in a row now the people I closed with have spent the last three or so hours of our shift complaining about how they want to be done and go to sleep. I can understand a comment or two about maybe being a little sleepy or a little hungry. But there is no reason that you need to be complaining to no end about how much you hate this night shift when you just started. I know damn well that you got to pick most of your shifts this week, and if you knew you had school work to do after work, YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SIGNED UP FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT. AND already I've seen employees treating things as if they have been there for years. (sweeping things under tables, not cleaning things all the way, not taking the extra TWO seconds to sanitize something before putting it away). Apparently I'm one of the few people there that actually want to do my BEST job while I'm working, there's no reason not to put your best foot forward when you're at work, especially when the store has just opened and we need to do our best to get customers. But it's already apparent that some of these people prepare themselves to put in about 60% into what they are doing. No wonder these people are talking about having so many jobs before this, they probably were let go because they were being ridiculous. Alright, got that out of my system, I just hope they figure these things out before they get fired.\nTL;DR:"}

I have a lot of weird internal struggles that make me hate myself.\nPOST: I am a teenager from a very wealthy family. I go to an affluent school, and even then, I have a lot more than most of my peers have. Although I feel very guilty admitting it, I can pretty much anything I want, whenever I want. To make matters worse, I have a very snobby personality, though luckily nobody except me has ever noticed it since I don't interact with anyone else much. I tend to have two primary emotions towards others: extreme jealousy or mocking. I see people as either high above me, whether in social class or skill, which makes me angry and jealous, or below me, in which case I see them as inferior. I don't have many friends, though everyone surprisingly seems to like me. I guess I'm good at hiding my real views toward them.\n\nI have a couple talents, but I hold myself back from them because I was told (but mostly by myself, TBH I guess) that those were \"loser\" talents. I like game development, though I'm horrible at it, and I'm okay at music. I'd probably be a lot better if I had discovered that talent myself, instead of being forced to play the piano by my mother since age three. She told me that everyone can play the piano and that it is important that I learn or I will be behind everyone. I never did learn, and don't want to. I'd rather learn to compose midi on the computer as resources my games. Whenever I try it though I think of her and the piano and get upset, which makes it tough for me to do it.\n\nI guess I just don't want to be a bully or villain I see myself as due to the views I perceive. I haven't seemed to hurt anyone except myself yet, but with the path I'm going down, things look grim. But in a perfect world, I would want to let go of the views I think I have towards others and be a beloved leader and friend instead. I want to love people!\nTL;DR:"}

We were given rubber gloves and told to go nuts poking and prodding.\n\nI found one of the cadavers that had had his chest split open and all his internal organs exposed and cut such that each organ could be individually removed.  And I got an idea.\n\nI waved over a girl from the group.  I told her I thought she was pretty and special.  I then proceeded to reach into the chest cavity of this cadaver and pull his heart out and present it to her with both hands, asking if she'd be my valentine.\n\nShe turned pale-green and almost threw up.

They have a covered bench and some agility-esque equipment in there. Anyways, we took Bailey over there a couple nights ago to run around and get some energy out before we had a few friends come over. We had been in there for about ten minutes when a mother and her son came walking up with their two dogs. The son was probably 8 or 9 and they had a big golden and a tiny Dachshund with them. Usually people around our complex are pretty good about either asking if our dog is dog friendly and it its okay for them to come join us or not, or waiting for us to be done. This mother and her son however, said nothing to us and proceeded to just come right in through the gate. Bailey was off leash and was very interested in these newcomers. Before they got to the gate I said \"let me grab my dog first\", but they came in anyways. Luckily Bailey isn't dog aggressive, but she plays pretty rough and can get in other dogs faces to play. Then the son keeps walking up to Bailey with their tiny Dachshund while I'm trying to get Bailey on her leash and I keep having to pull her away. So we decide to just leave, and after we walk 20ft away or so, they just leave the dog park.

I was like, \"uh, no, I like my hair right now and it's not long\" and she would not have it! She just said things like \"Do it for your mom!\" and \"Your hair looks really bad\" and worst, she would just yell \"Thank you!\" over and over as if I had agreed to the haircut while she walked away because she didnt want to talk about it anymore.\n\nAnother example. I went grocery shopping with my mom and she decided to get a box of like 30 cookies for my dad. I was so upset cause my dad is diabetic so I told her to leave them for that reason. All she kept saying was, \"if I dont get them, he'll find cookies somewhere else!\" and \"your dad needs a treat!\" and all this shit, never addressing my concerns. Anyway, I ended up stealing the cookies from her cart at checkout and putting them back. I was so upset.\n\nI was just hoping for some advice on how to argue with someone who literally does not hear anything you say.

We both said we weren't interested in a relationship.\n\nThe first month we saw each other a few times and had sex about the 5th time.

In the moment I said I did and she said okay.( I felt pressure and I wasn't sure)\n\nSoon after that she was at this guys(we'll call him Joe) house whom she has slept with before. She told me that if she had not said okay to us being monogamist she would have slept with Joe then. She also said that she didn't want to be monogamist and I agreed.\n\nShe said we should make some rules. I told her I simply didn't want to know, she didn't like that and said it's important to her to be open about sex. She said that Joe wants to know the important aka repeats. I said just tell me that you did it and the first name( because she apparently wants to tell me first names).\n\nLately we've been hanging out but not having sex. This weekend she is going to have sex with Joe and another guy. This bothers me for a few reasons. We talked about it but I still have some things to say.

I even hallucinated that I saw my boyfriend walk out of the room with my bloody period in his hands, ready to be my period salesman.     \nI then proceeded to take the longest, worst smelling shit of my life.\n\nI later found out that my boyfriend left the cabin and asked our friends if he could sleep in their tent.

In the past we would always bullshit saying things like \"You know, one of these days we're going to hook up,\" but in a completely joking manner.

Fast forward about 30 minutes, we both walk towards the bathroom and it seems like out of nowhere we are making out with each other in this out-cove right before the bathroom. About 30 seconds of intense making out ensued and it was over.\n\nI feel guilty, we both said it can't happen again. It would absolutely break my gf's heart if she found out. She cheated on me once before, I found out, it was just a make out, we continued on just fine minus a slight trust problem for a little while. What should I do? I know it's bad, it was meaningless and might cause less damage if she never found out but at the same time I feel guilty.\nTL;DR:"}

She looks healthy, she is awesome and cute and they both him and his wife love her very much. \n\nHowever, when I asked him where did they get her from, he told me he brought her over from a Hungary breeder via Bulgaria. After asking him the name and googling it, I found out that they are BYB and \"puppy-importers\" from the \"best european breeders\". They are from Bulgaria, stationed in Cyprus. Not even close to Hungary. He also told me something that worried me. He told me that the passport/vaccination book has a fake birth date, because it wasn't legal to export puppies from Hungary that are younger than 8 months old (he got her when she was 2). I am also suspecting that the pedigree is fake too, as the \"breeder\" sells the puppy cheaper if the dog comes without a pedigree.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I try my luck and adopt her? She is the sweetest little thing, but the situation smells fishy. Just to clarify, I just mean the breeder; the family is loving to the dog.

Depending on how plans go, we could be apart for as much as 7 months.  We've considered taking a break during this time so as to not burden ourselves with being so far away from each other.  The problem is that I don't want to be a party to such a break.  I'm committed to her and she reiterated her commitment right before she left as well.  I'm not sure that I can reconcile with her if she does go out with other people, but still wants to be with me.  I'm at a loss for what to do.\n\nMy SO will be back in two months, and we'll spend until the end of year together until our abroad plans come to fruition.  I love this girl and I can definitely say that she's changed my life for the better in so many ways.  She wants to be with me right now, and even she's having a difficult time considering whether she wants to experience other people or stick with me.  We make each other so happy, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to lose that.\nTL;DR:"}

The first 2 years were great and we were very intimate and close.\n\nNowadays, I feel uncomfortable with being sexually intimate with her because I am no longer really attracted to her and that really upsets her. (my sex drive has also been severely hampered by my dickhole anti-depressant medication).\n\nShe's still madly in love with me to a point that she breaks down and cries if I don't show her enough affection or if I give her hints at how I feel in the relationship. It's gotten to a point where, sure, I love her, mainly through consequence of time being with her but I essentially don't want to do anything with her and I feel the relationship is just a major weight on my life.\n\nI also live, not too far, about 1.5hrs away from her and only see her once a week. I've found that I really don't think about her or miss her.\n\nShe's kind of crazy too. She breaks down very easily or snaps at me for not being good enough for her or whatever. It seems cruel but I'm now basically in the relationship because me being with her makes her happy and she blatantly states that her world will crumble without me. I feel trapped in a relationship prison. It's so hard to break up with her because she acts as if it will make her go insane or something.\n\nI don't really know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been spending less and less time together and I feel as if she's pushing me away. I do give her space if she needs it and i do everything i can to make her happy but it feels like it's not enough. If I ask her about our time together she dodges the subject or ignores me. Idk it seems like she doesn't even try for me anymore and I'm always the one to make her happy but she can't be bothered with me. I still love her with all my heart but lately all she's been doing is hurting me. \n\nI told her that and I try to break things off but she always says things will change and that she loves me and I can't say no to that. She just can't seem to let me go and I love her too much but I'm not sure I believe it when she says she loves me. I know if I stay I'll just keep getting hurt but i might never find a girl who loves as much as she does (or did). I'm not sure what to do.

It's the in between that is the problem.\nMy girlfriend and I are pretty normal actually. We meet, we do simple stuff, go for meals as much as we can. Thing is, I don't really feel happy with her. I just feel 'not sad'.\nI have met two other girls that have really made me feel happy and all, but I have put them in my sister-zone. Now both are happy with another and well, nothing much changes.\nHere's the complicated part. My girlfriend and I had a break for about a month, and during that time, I had a small fling with one of the girls that truly made me happy. Even after patching back with my girlfriend, I still feel this huge sense of loss. Seeing this other girl, walking under her block, and seeing her with another guy really leaves an unpleasant sinking feeling in my gut. I don't only think of 'What if's, I think of 'I wish's too.\nNow, I admit it's my own fault and stupidity that I landed myself in this state, but I am really trying to fix it. I have stopped demanding and expecting from my girlfriend, I aim to make her simply happy. I don't want to hurt her anymore. But if this goes on, it won't be good.\nSeeking advice here, on how I can get over this other girl, and how I can cope with this relationship dynamic of giving all I can.\nI know I should be appreciative of her and not expect anything in return for what I do. That is unconditional love isn't it? But sometimes giving one-sidedly can be tiring, and not being able to really feel happy can be well, depressing. So yeah, hoping for help. Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

I think she's amazing, so pretty and funny. however she does seem to have slight attachment issues due to boarding and so insists on constant contact when she is abroad: e.g. if I were to take an hour to respond to a message she will get worried and ask one of my friends to contact me and get me to text her back. Despite this we're both happy in  each other's company.\n\nHowever, I have another friend who I'm incredibly close with- she is really smart, hilarious, pretty and we share more interests than anybody I've ever met. In fact in the past people have commented that we seem 'perfect for each other', which we both laugh off.  In the last few months I've begun to feel a strong attraction to her as well, most prominently when my gf is out of the country.\n\nI know I'll never cheat on my gf but I'm still guilty about these feelings, and I'm not entirely sure if they're reciprocated or not. My question is- should I confront my friend about these feelings, should I tell my gf, should I pretend they don't exist? Is it right for me to remain in a relationship with somebody if I have feelings for other people too?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nP.S. I know I'm an asshole for liking two girls at the same time- If I could feel differently I would.\nTL;DR:"}

Generally, I would manage to gather $3-$5 cash if I needed it, and back then (early 90's) that could get me by for a couple of days.  Purchasing gasoline with cash and only a limited amount (i.e. not a fill-up) always involved paying the cashier first so that the pump would stop at the amount paid.\n\nSo, one day, I was in a big hurry to get to a soccer tournament and my car ran out of gas about 100 yards from the gas station with $3.25 in my pocket.  Undaunted, I emptied the 1 gallon water jug I had in the back floorboard for when the car would overheat, trekked the 100 yards to the store, and bought $0.25 in gas (roughly 1/4 gallon), pumped it into the milk jug, walked back to the car, then fueled the car enough to drive to the gas pump.  This worked out fine.\n\nOnce I'd gotten the car to the the pump, I went into the store a second time, paid for $3 in gas, walked back to the car, got in and drove off.\n\nAbout 5 miles on my way, the car acted like it was running out of gas *again* then died.  Having run out of gas twice, at first I was sure I had a gas leak.  After all, I had *just bought* $3 worth.\n\nI was about half way through with my walk back home that I entertained the possibility that I had driven off without pumping the gas.  This was confirmed by the very amused gas station clerk who refunded my $3.\nTL;DR:"}

Water line easement offer grows 10x\nPOST: This has just been my observation as of late, but for example: I was offered a payment by the local water municipal to purchase an easement in my back yard for a future water line.  To me this seemed like I'd get nothing for it since it is between 2 gas line easements which were in place when I bought the house.  The first offer was $400, and due to procrastination I never responded and after a month or so they upped the offer to $700.  Again I procrastinated and eventually started getting calls about this easement, they assumed my reservations were due to the shed that is built over the easement (a small 8'x10' wood shed on a concrete slab of which I couldn't care less about).  This led to someone coming out and looking at the shed and all the junk in my backyard (more projects that I'm procrastinating on, a couple vehicles and trailers).  Which that guy was going to send someone out to quote moving the shed, but I never got contacted by anyone for that.... anyway, long story short the most recent offer has jumped to $4000 (with the water company responsible for replacing fences and gates taken down during the installation of the pipe) and this one seems to be a take it or it goes to an appraiser.

Mostly painkillers n Xanax. So I fell asleep on the couch and woke up this morning. As I get up everything's kinda fuzzy and shit and it really annoys me because I've never been this dizzy after popping pills or drinking or anything like that. So I wake up and get up because I have to piss really bad. \n \nWell just know that there's one bathroom that's literally like 5 steps away from my couch/living room. You know when you're laying down or sitting down for a long time and you suddenly get up you have a mini blackout in your brain. You can't stand still and everything goes black. Yea well that happened to me as I was stumbling to the bathroom with my pants pulled low enough for me to piss and as I was trying to piss my brain had that mini blackout and let me say that the dizziness from the medication didn't help either. \n\nSo I'm about to piss when the mini blackout hits and next thing you know I lean forward while the golden stream is unleashing from my disco stick because when you blackout you don't even know what's happening. So my bladder decides to let loose while my brain shuts down temporarily and my whole body momentum is going forward and next thing you know, I fall down forwards like someone did a crossover of the year move on me and hit my forehead on the upper part of the toilet where like you can take the lid off n stuff. \n\nThe impact of the hit makes me even more dizzer and I'm trying to figure out what in the jesus fuck happened while my dick misses the toilet completely because I'm in some sort of 70 degree angle bent over.

How do I talk to her?\nPOST: My 20 year old sister just got engaged this weekend to a 20 year old guy whom I've never met. They've known each other for less than a year - most of which has been long distance due to him being in the military and he has been stationed across the USA. She is reckless, rebellious, and immature; but she's also an intelligent, passionate, and caring individual. Unfortunately she has never moved away from home, has never been financially independent, and still has yet to \"grow up\" (in my opinion) - and while you may not need these things to be in love and get married, they are things I wish my sister would have before embarking on marriage. In my honest opinion, she is young, lustful, and still in the honeymoon phase of her first \"real relationship\", and that is what scares me. But it also scares me that I do not know the man who has asked for her hand in marriage and what his true intentions are. I know it is not my place to change her mind or discourage her from this engagement; however, as her older brother I want to pass on as much meaningful advice as possible. I am seeking advice on how to approach her regarding my concerns while not being overbearing and negative - I realize this is not my life, it is hers. So, any help on how to speak to my younger sister about an engagement of which I don't necessarily approve?\nTL;DR:"}

Just not sure of what to do.\nPOST: I began dating my gf in high school.  We were best friends for a couple of years leading up to the relationship, so we knew each other well and everything started off smoothly.  Overall, I would say that our relationship has been steady and healthy.  However, lately I have had second thoughts for several reasons:\n\n1. We hardly have any common interests.  I love sports, working out, and being active while she leads a sedentary lifestyle (leading to her gaining weight and me becoming less attracted to her).  She is quite extroverted while I have a social life, but I am certainly introverted.  Just a couple examples...we just don't have much in common.\n\n2. Our sex life has gone from once a week, to once a month, to now once every 3-4 months.  I completely understand this is normal to a certain extent, but I want more and she makes me feel like I'm just using her any time I attempt to come on to her.\n\n3. I originally fell in love with her and decided to take the next step into a relationship because she adored me and treated me extremely well.  I loved her personality and just her outlook on life; however, now I feel like she just does not care like she used to.  She denies this, but it's easy to tell.\n\nI know I may not be a good person for saying this, but I'm not 100% attracted to her.  What attracted me to her was her attitude and wonderful personality.  But it just seems like her feelings for me just aren't the way they were before and I do not know how to proceed.  I love her, but I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

Obviously she's already had a shower since she reeked so badly of smoke and I washed all of her clothes immediately.

He spent the entire night being incredibly annoying to her, getting her in a huge bear hug every so often, and using every opportunity to initiate physical contact with her (despite the fact that she would slap him quite hard every time he did this), leading to her leaving after a few hours.\n\nThe problem with this is that however much people point this out to him, he regularly hangs out with women who - and I mean no offence when I say this - are extremely easy, and his confidence bordering on arrogance and overly touchy-feely attitude gets him laid pretty frequently with them (in fact, he even had a girlfriend for a few months, who cheated on her then-boyfriend to be with him, and then cheated on him to get with one of his best friends), leading to his opinion that he is some sort of casanova-type figure, and that the women who get annoyed/offended by him are prudes who he wouldn't want to go for anyway.\n\nHonestly, it's beginning to frustrate me that I can't invite my oldest and best friend to events at which there is a possibility that some of the other people there might be female, especially since I now live and go to university away from home, so have less opportunities to spend time with my friends than I usually would.\nTL;DR:"}

Everytime I see a bump that doesn't belong, I head down to the clinic to get it acid burned off. They are quite small and infrequent. I have never passed along either STD to anyone that I know of, and I am definitely good about using safe sex and such, and would cater to the desires the lady needed to be more comfortable (except perhaps complete abstinence).\n\nSo, that said, I'm wondering if, when I create my profile, its better to put the fact that I have STDs right there in the profile, or if I should wait until I get to know a potential date a little better (but before sexual activity) to break it to her. I have checked out those sites only for people with STDs and such, but it seems like those are kinda crap, not very widely used, and not a lot of potential matches in my area. Hence the thought of going to a site that is more mainstream.\n\nLadies, how would you want it broken to you that a guy you might be interested in meeting has STDs, and would that be a total deal breaker for you?

Being the cheapskate that I am, I skirt the fee and decide to let them deliver it at standard P&P.\n\nFast forward 8 days and I've run out of clean clothes and I need to take the trash out. I decided to go out with a towel around my waist and damp hair so it looked like I'd showered.\n\nSo I'm halfway down my drive when a huge gust of wind makes me lose grip on the towel and I'm suddenly stood there stark naked, towel flying across the yard. It's also frosty which I failed to realize at the time and I start running and I slip and land right on my ass.\n\nCars are passing in the street as I struggle to get up from the slippery floor and one pulls up on the sidewalk beside me. I look up to see that it's my grandma with her 6 year old niece. She's screaming at me, telling me that I'm a depraved pedophile for exposing myself like this.\n\nWhilst she's stood there lecturing me, a parade of school kids, choir boys and a brownie troop all led by a nun come around the corner and just stop, some giggling, some fainting. One even had a nose bleed. I'm blushing hard.\n\nMy grandma then slaps me in the face, gets in her car, drives off and I limp inside. 30 mins later the washing machine I ordered arrives and hands me a towel that he found on my drive and asks if it was mine, I say no. He then says \"well whatever pool soul lost this is probably very embaressed right now\".\nTL;DR:"}

They weren't and I found out he was just getting into a relationship with a foreign exchange student that had gone to his high school. \n\nShe rarely comes back to the US to visit from the European country in which she lives and they've been together for about a year now. Jakob and I live in the same town for the summer and he's taken me on multiple date like activities: movies, dinner, kayaking, etc. and every time he is flirty. \n\nOur friends all joke that we are dating and in the future we will get married when we realize we are meant for each other and we play it off since he's in a relationship with someone else. However this gf has no inclination of wanting to go to college or live in the US at any point. I need advice in what I should do or say to him. I still love him and always will and I don't know what I'd do if we ever just stopped talking.\nTL;DR:"}

I am not making any definite plans and I am open to going just about anywhere while loosely attempting to head south.

Which brings up another issue: I am leaving with only hundreds of dollars to my name.

I've been around for a long time, fell off the wagon and now I'm getting back on. I'm female, 5'3.5\", and 152 lbs. Small frame. I've been counting calories and eating way more whole foods than I used to, and ended up consuming anywhere from 750-1000 calories per day. Obviously, this is a really low amount. I feel full though! Probably because of the whole foods/lean protein I'm eating,\n\nLong story short, I went to the doctor because I was losing way slower than I was expecting at that calorie level. He, of course, referred me to a nutritionist who, of course, told me to eat more.\n\nI know this is the right thing to do mentally, but I feel so satisfied on the amount of calories I'm eating right now that I'm really scared to up the calories and balloon back up to my starting weight. Logically I know that won't happen, and that I got to be the weight I am by eating way more than 1200 calories, but it's a total mindset change. I've also been adding a reasonable amount of exercise (c25k and walking all over campus instead of taking the bus) and I know I need more calories to effectively fuel my body if I want to improve my fitness.\n\nI want to clarify, I am adding more calories in to bring my daily total to 1200 (hooray peanut butter!) but it's hard to change my mindset. I started my journey this time around with a calorie goal of 1200 and just had a lot of trouble reaching it. I didn't actively choose to slash my calories as low as I have. I feel like now I'll be eating just to eat. :( \n\nSorry for the rambling, everyone! I just feel a bit overwhelmed and scared right now, and needed to get this out there.\nTL;DR:"}

I insisted that until the dog started behaving better, he would be in a crate unless some one was home with the dogs. I didn't want my dog's injury to get worse, or give them an opportunity to fight at all. \n\nA day later I'm on the couch with both dogs, and my dog came over to lick my face as he does occasionally.

I know he's been (obviously) upset the whole time, but I think he was sort of in denial until recently.

And honestly, I'm not sure I should really be encouraging him to confide in me much more than he does, because I've never lost a loved one, and really don't know what to say.

I'd imagine everyone would be sick of the situation in a year or so and another solution would *have* to be found.\n\nThe alternative though, is to have a really horrid year of divorce (which I imagine she'll contest) and him being the \"bad guy\".

When we first got together everything was amazing, I even went on a trip with his family the second week we were together. Everything was \"I love you\" all the time and he constantly called or texted me. About two months into it he went MIA without any explanation to me. No response to any of my calls, texts, nothing. A few weeks went by and I called him up for what was going to be my last attempt, and he answered. He wanted to get back together and give me some explanations. I agreed and things seemed fine again, although I barely had any trust for him. \n\nCut to now he wont respond to my texts for a few hours and acts like he doesn't want to see me, but every time I ask him about it he gets extremely defensive and mad that I think he doesn't care. I'm really bad with confrontation and tend to just let him win and agree with him, then feel insecure every time we're apart. \n\nHow can I talk to him about this but stand my ground at the same time?

The only problem is that for a while, I developed very strong feelings for her and to be honest, it was really hard to shake them. I never wanted to say anything because we were roommates, and I really cherish her friendship and wasn't sure what my confession would do to that. So I kept everything inside.

She had to go to the ER a few times for passing out because she wasn't eating, and was depressed. Now she's on multiple meds.

They provide shelter and basic care for the homeless so they can turn their lives around.\n\nShe's been there a few months and isn't doing too much better in my eyes. Though she has no degree or real skills, she still thinks that after her program she'll be able to buy $50 shampoo and that she'll be able to afford renting beach front property in SoCal. To be clear, she thinks she'll be able to do this on her own without a man, and she plans to get her 4 year degree after the program too (she does has a benefit to cover tuition at a state school).\n\nLast I visited her, I took her to lunch at Whole Foods and when I went away to the restroom, she came back to me with a basket of $200 worth of beauty products for me to buy her, which we hadn't agreed to.

So a couple of nights ago, we got on the topic of cockroaches and I remembered that when I was about 8 a cockroach managed to crawl its way down my ear and die. Maybe because I was little, I dunno, but I from then on believed that the doctor managed to take the roach out by squirting water through one ear with a syringe, thus causing my deceased companion to be flushed out through the opposite ear. Flash-forward 12 years. Im 20 now, and so I told this story and was laughed at. I strongly tried to stand my ground stating that the ears were interconnected. Long story short. I was embarrassingly proven wrong by three of my friends that night.... next day the whole town knows and am the laughing stock of everybody, and probably will be for years to come....\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: [M16]Should I try to keep on going with my crush?\nPOST: So last period in school I had a schoolproject about making a small movie with these two girls. We really enjoyed doing it, and had fun doing it. Before the project we knew each other, but didnt really ever talk or anything. \n\nAs the end of period drew closer I really started liking their company, espacially the other girl (they are each others best friends). We started saying helloes and talking a bit outside the project, and I started crushing (is that a word?) on her. \n\nI am really bad in reading women (also never been in real relationship before thought I have many girls as friends), but I think she might like me a bit too, or at least not hate me. If we meet somewhere she always smiles and says hello, sometimes wants so talk a bit more as well. \n\nOur school also has this thing that you can buy a small candy and a card to be delivered to someone on last day before break, and I got one signed by both of these girls I was in the project. After I got it my crush came to me and asked if I got it, I answered yes and thanked her (and later on the other girl) alot. \n\nSo my question is what should I do now? Is she really into me and should I try to go on, or is this just natural kindness from girls? \nOur project is on break until somewhere after March, and I think that is too late to wait for.\n\n The another thing that makes this kind hard is that she might already have a boyfriend of some sort if my another friend is right. I dont feel right to try to \"steal\" a reserved girl. On the other hand I know that teenager relationships tend to be fragile as is..\n\nI am thinking about asking him how her xmas went after 24th day on Facebook, but I dont want to us to lose our friendship in regards of trying to be even more. I also dont want to harass her with unneeded messeages if she doesn't like them. Do girls generally like if they get sent a msg?\n\nOh damn, that was a long.\nTL;DR:"}

For the past 17 years of my life she has told me about the few people she dated in high school and college until she finally met my dad at age 32 and married him and then had me at age 37. That's it. That was the story.\n\nMy mom is a schoolteacher and a simple christian woman. she tells the truth and lives an average middle class life.Which is why yesterday I was so shocked when at a dinner out together she told me that she had something to tell me.\n\nAfter college she married a different man we will call Phil. They were married for two years when one day she found psychopathic diaries and pills in his drawer and confronted him. He turned violent and she broke off the marriage. She saw Phil a year after their divorce at a festival and  she saw him with another woman. she was glad he moved on, but felt bad for the new girlfriend.\nBUT IT DOESN'T END THERE\nA few years after their divorce she gets a call from her brother and he says \"turn on the news right now\" . On the evening news was a picture of Phil and that woman from the festival with the caption \"couple found dead in hotel\" . Turns out Phil murdered her, and then killed himself. \n\nI sat there in absolute shock as my seemingly normal mother told me a story that could be on a lifetime movie. What's been bothering me is that apparently her whole family and my dads whole family all knew this. Her coworkers know this. My best friends parents moms this story. I was the last to find out because \"she didnt know the right time\". My whole view of my mother has been altered and I don't really know how or what is normal to feel right now , especially since I'm the last to find out.(besides my poor brother who is in college and my mom STILL hasn't told him) \nSorry this is super long but I'm just unsettled.

He's a very attractive man, he knows what turns me on and is very attentive to my needs and never pressures me into sex. \n\nHowever.\n\nI find that most of the time, I don't want sex. I've always had a low libido (either naturally or because of birth control or both). If I'm not in a relationship, I usually can go months without pleasuring myself. It's not something I put a high priority on. I'm generally more consumed with what I need to do that day, what tasks need to get done, what I'm going to make for dinner etc.\n\nIt's not even just the craving part. As previously mentioned, He's very attentive to my needs. But it always seems like the moment he starts his seduction dance (ie. wanting to take a shower together, kissing my neck, giving me a massage etc.) I find myself more likely to refuse or be repelled. Almost as if the notion of him wanting sex from me immediately turns me off. I don't know if it's because I feel obligated or something that makes me want to do it less, but it's causing a great strain. I know as a man he has some needs, and he's been more than flexible with me. Especially since I already have some pretty strict \"in order to get me in the mood\" guidelines (must have showered (both), must not have bad breath, can't be before work, can't be after eating etc.). He follows them perfectly, but then the moment I fine out he wants sex, I become really closed off. \n\nI love the sex we have when we do have it. I'm always satisfied. But for some reason I hit a road block with the work up to it. Anyone experienced something like this before?\nTL;DR:"}

We had only been friends up until this point, but when the time came that I had to go back, we were together. Everything went smooth from then on out, I visited her again and everything was still great. I'm a relatively short guy myself (5'6\") and haven't had the best of luck with women, so getting together with this girl after one visit was quite a nice surprise to me.\n\nNow to my problem: This past Saturday, we had one of our usual talks and I didn't sense any problem at all, she was very playful, like always. Sunday she didn't come online, much to my surprise, but on Monday morning she told me she needed time to think and on Wednesday morning she broke up with me on the grounds of \"maturity/age difference, the long-distance and wanting to go forward\". \n\nThis girl meant everything to me and still does. I've come to terms with not being able to be in a romantic relationship with her, but I still can't stand the thought of losing a friend.\n\nThe ending of this relationship just seems so weird to me, with it ending so abruptly and without warning.\n\nWe had arranged plans for her to spend Christmas here with me, I have already bought the tickets and have everything planned, but with the end of the relationship I'm not sure what's best for both parts; I'd still like for her to visit me so we can talk things out and have a nice time together, just as friends.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me to help me move on and hopefully still stay friends with her?\nTL;DR:"}

We hit it off pretty instantly and began dating in the beginning of October. I knew that he smoked weed and I did too occasionally, so it wasn't a big deal really. He even cut down the amount he smoked a lot because I smoked very little actually. We were head over heels in love with each other, just absolutely crazy. We made each other so, so happy. \n\nIn the beginning of May, I moved in with him and his family for the summer to work. I'm from a small town with little to no job opportunities and he's from a city super close to Toronto. So although we'd only been dating a little over 6 months at this point, moving in was necessary for me to find work. We would've missed each other terribly as well so the move just felt natural. \n\nNot long after I moved in, he had to do some shitty car repairs that cost $3,000. He said that he wanted to start selling weed. Smoking is one thing, but selling is another. I told him I didn't really like the idea of it, but he said it would just be temporary. Everything else was still great, so I decided I could just grit my teeth for the time being until he was done. But every time he picks up, he picks up more and more. One time he was scaling a decent amount and I told him he needs to be careful, and he replies \"I don't think about it so don't worry\". Uh... yeah I'm worried. \n\nI thought I could be okay with it because I love him so much. But every time some random number or some guy texts him to pick up, I get angrier and angrier. I'm starting to become resentful and it's starting to show by my increasing frequent irritable moods. I want to talk to him but I don't know what to say. Breaking up is NOT an immediate go-to option because this is our first serious problem and I need to attempt to work through it with him first.\nTL;DR:"}

I do this with my mom, dad (also found out he was cheating on my step-mom this way), and my ex-boyfriends. I know its wrong but anyway, I looked through my current boyfriend's history last night and he was looking at things like hookups on craigslist, dating websites, and escort sites and porn (tmi: czech street girl porn is what he always watches) all in the same night. So I confronted him about it and he said that a guy in his class told him about escort/hookup websites and he was just looking at them for fun. And he got mad at me for looking through his history, which I totally understand, but said that if I did that again we would break up..which just makes me more suspicious. My fear is that because he always watches the czech porn where a guy walks up to random girls and pays them for sex that he may have a sort of fetish about paying for sex or casual sex. Side-notes: I am the only girl he's ever slept with, we have a normal sex life, he is from another country (korea) so its possible that he was just curious about that, but he's very shy and I find it very difficult to picture him talking to anyone in his class, especially about hookups and escorts. Anyways I know I'm probably just being really paranoid because of knowing about my dad's cheating and even my step-dad having an addiction to porn which ended my mom's marriage.

He said, \"Sorry [name],\" and went to do the project with my sadistic bully.\n\nAt the time it didn't register as a super big deal to me. I just made a mental note, \"Okay, what I learned from this experience is that I should never assume someone wants to be my friend.\" That's so fucked up!

I don't have friends now because I'm terrified of making myself vulnerable again, in addition to the usual problems like low self-esteem and lack of social skills.

I shut off all the water, get everything out of the area, and soak up all the excess water with towels.\n\nOnce everything seems to have calmed down I go upstairs to inspect the plumbing on the sink. There was a plastic coupler that the seal looked to have gone bad on and was leaking. I remove it and head to my local hardware store to purchase a new one. After hunting around the store for a while, I can't seem to find the piece I am looking for and ask a cashier for assistance. She points me to another employee that is...unkempt to say the least. He had a very disheveled look, was missing his right eye, and had band-aids on his fingers. These all should have been warning signs that he probably wasn't the guy I should be asking help from.\n\nAfter hunting around for a while, turns out that they don't have what I am looking for. However, the salesman suggests taking apart the coupler and just adding some rubber o-rings so it will seal and stop the leaks. Now I'm not the most experienced person in plumbing, but I'm relatively handy and it seemed logical. I leave the store happy, hook up the coupler with the new o-rings, and kick the water on.\n\nEverything seemed to be fine at first. I sat for a minute inspecting for leaks, when all of a sudden the ENTIRE coupler blows in half where he had taken it apart to add the o-rings.

[UPDATE]\nPOST: [Original Thread] \n\nIn the first thread I mentioned that my boyfriend had emotionally cheated two years ago, and when I found out seven months ago, I was devastated and it's really changed things about our relationship.\n\nI broke up with him. It was hard, and I couldn't bear to see him cry. But I did it, and I know its what's best for me at least. I came over when he woke up and explained that since I found out about his infidelities, I started falling out of love with him and have been trying so hard to rekindle my feelings, but I just couldn't look at him the same anymore without seeing him with the other girl and picturing them together. I also said it's not fair to him because I can't put in as much as he has and that I've spent most of the relationship afraid of him. He cried and so did I. That was about it, then I left feeling extremely guilty for leaving him in tears, but that was probably the only thing I felt guilty for, aside from hurting him like that.\n\nHe texted me later to say that he hopes I'll be happy again and that he doesn't blame me. I really did enjoy our time together and having to walk away from our four year relationship was so difficult, but I think he'll be alright.\n\nThanks so much for your advice, everyone. I really needed it.\nTL;DR:"}

There are at least two known packages that were shipped to the old address, with a total worth of $200 ($135 and $65).  Because my purchases have gone missing so often, I insured this last one ($135).  When I asked the sender where the package was, they informed me it had been recieved and showed me a screenshot that the package had been delivered.  I noted that the address was wrong and that it had been sent to my old apartment.  The sender called the landlord (which is a housing complex) and one of the employees said that they had the latest package right there and to come and get it. However, they claim to have no other packages and none of the packages have been returned to sender.  I am currently in a small claims court fight with the apartment complex because they refuse to return my security deposit and refuse to tell me why.  I believe they are holding my mail and not forwarding it or returning to the post office out of spite.  How do I get it back, how do I prove that they are keeping it, and is what legal reprecussions could they face?\nTL;DR:"}

I wasn't sure what to think of it and most of my anger was toward my friend because I have known him for years and that was really weird and confusing to me that he would do that. I confronted him via facebook because that's all I really can do at this point other than skype and he said she was hitting on him and he was just seeing how it would work out, but they both wanted to know how I felt about it. That seems sketch to me especially since I wasn't gone even a full week at that point. It just seems wrong and that they were waiting for me to leave and they had this sudden guilt about immediately. I honestly don't know how to go about this or if i'm doing the right thing. I'm the kind of person who needs every detail to make sense of a situation and the fact that they're leaving something out doesn't seem right because they both now that about me. To give you some more details I have known my friend since 8th grade and were both juniors in college, and I have known my girlfriend since freshman year of college. Also they have only known each other for two weeks. the two weeks I visited the school we mutually go to (my friend recently transferred from another university).

Usually he's been pretty energetic, and he loved the outdoors. He loved to fish, and hunt, and be outside, but lately he just sits on the couch, watches television, drinks, while smoking pot and cigars. I've noticed he can hardly walk up a flight of stairs without breathing quite heavy. He coughs constantly in the morning and throughout the day etc. So I brought it up to him last night, he got very defensive, and he told me straight up \"I don't care about my health\". \n\nOur family is generally healthy. My grandfather (dads side) has died recently at 93. He had a heart defect, but up until then he was fine. My grandmother (dads side) has serious alzheimer's, and she can't remember the last 30 years of her life. There's also a history of cancer in our family. My dads best friend has also died recently--- of cancer. He was diagnosed with it and given 6 months to live. He died about a month ago. \n\nI bring up my family history because I'm worried that my dad isn't taking the steps necessary to secure a generally healthy future. And I bring up my dads best friend who died recently because I feel like my dad should learn from that, cut back on the cigars (he and his friend smoke and drank when together), and go for run/walk with me (I've asked him to go and he refuses), or at least take the time to workout or go for walks by himself. \n\nI just feel really lost here on what to do. And part of me feels like can't do anything at all to help my dad. I mentioned it to my mother (they're divorced) and she told me that it's probably too late to change my fathers ways. If my dad doesn't care about his health, can I even do anything? Should I just not even waste my energy?\nTL;DR:"}

He'd hug all his friends (girls and guys) and I'd do the same, but we don't do that to each other. It's never been our thing, and we always have an awkward wave at the end of the night.

I never felt so much pain in my life but after kicking her out of our apartment and realised four hours later that I just couldn't do it and realised right then that I wanted to work on things. We were even intement that night full of emotion and passion. \n\nMy issue is just that though, our intemency. She seems honestly sorry and has expressed to me how she feels disgusted, disappointed, and growse. \n\nWe've both discussed cheating and cheaters and how sick they make us and so she has expressed how horrible she feels that she did the one thing she hates so much. \n\nTomorrow she is going to go talk to her therapist, who has helped her through post pardum and gave us good relationship counseling, and then we are going to make multiple appointments to go in together. \n\nMy issue is that she keeps turning me down, not harshly or rude by any means, but I want to restore our.. sex.. and she keeps turning me down. I try not to feel inadequate or not attractive but it's hard. I just don't know whether she's not ready because of the thought of what she's done or what but it's starting to make me feel inadequate to her.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this or anything similar.\nAny advice to cope and move forward would be great. I also have much more detail into her feelings if anyone wants them.\nTL;DR:"}

Since I am very impulsive I kind of rushed into it since it was New Years. Classic right?\n\nAnyways, I went to a professional center because I assumed I was going to need help to get the right schedules going and all that so it was really expensive.\n\nWhen I went in to enroll myself in their center I asked to pay monthly. When they gave me my contract it said; It was recurring payments every month for a year and when I was to quit before that year I was going to have to give them notice atleast a month in advance. So, if I wanted to quit let's say March, I would still have to pay for march and April. \n\nAtleast that's what I and my step-dad thought.\nYesterday, I went in and asked to stop my subscription and saw that I had only gone for a month and already paid for 3 months. The guy at the center told me, I asked for a year and kind of laughed that I was already trying to stop. He said that's not how this center works you can't just tell us you're going to go for a year and quit after a couple months. \n\nWhen I kind of sat there shocked that I was going to have to pay for an entire year when I don't want to go at all, he eventually told me; I'll do you a favour and have you pay for 6 months instead of a year. We'll also freeze your membership so, whenever you feel like working out again, you can just come in and work out for the months you paid.\nTL;DR:"}

Like, I *love* it and I can eat it straight out of the piping bag; it's so good. So, as we were decorating, I was alternating between icing the roof and icing the inside of my mouth. I noticed my mouth was tingling a bit and the frosting had a sort of acidic after-taste but as we'd bought the kit fairly cheaply from the local supermarket, I thought nothing of it and figured it just wasn't as good quality stuff as the one we got last year. \n\nOnce we'd finished, I was eating the half a bag that was leftover and decided to pipe some onto my girlfriend's nose. As revenge, she piped a moustache onto my upper lip. I laughed, ate it off and started helping to clean up some of the mess we'd made. Everything was fine until I went into the bathroom to wash the sticky remainder off my face and discovered a red 'moustache' above my lips, which had now started to swell.\n\nCut to a few hours later and my skin is still hot and red, I'm sweating and my mouth has that prickly feeling you get when you eat something too-sweet like pineapple. Guess I won't be going anywhere tonight.\nTL;DR:"}

New to Reddit and I'm typing this on mobile but here I go\nMe and my girlfriend have been together for almost 2 years and we've had our ups and downs but we love eachother and want a future together.\nI met my girllfriend online while I was going to school to become a veterimary assistant and I'm currently back home working to pay off my student loans so I can move back and get an appartment and a job that I actually want and went to school for. My girlfriend lives a 7 hour bus ride away from me so we only get to see eachother every few months and its been like that for almost a year now and it sucks but its mostly my fault.\n\nWhat happens is, we usually have date nights; nights where we do things together like watch movies, Skype, play games, bone, all that wonderfull stuff. Those arent happening very often because I want them to be perfect.\nLets say I get off work at 5, loads of time for me to get supper and watch a movie and make love to my wonderful girlfriend before one of us has to be in bed to get up for school in her case or work in mine, but in my head thats not enough time. For whatever reason no amount of time is enough and I keep putting off date nights until I think it'll be perfect but it never is so it ends up being days without sex, weeks without Skype or movies and its not fair to her at all.\nI know shes getting frustrated with me and that only makes me want our time together more perfect which makes me dig my hole further down. The best thing to walk into my life deserves perfection but its my idea of perfection thats killing this relationship. I need help and I dont know where to turn. I have no friends and my family isnt a big fan of me dating another girl in the first place so I'm totally lost. Any advice would be helpful\nTL;DR:"}

I had met her once before and she seemed cool enough. I talked to her and teased my friend by saying her new friend is way cooler than her.

Of course I would still go to Italy to visit my family, but do I then use the tickets and hotel rooms to travel through Europe by myself?

I was surfing and to my dismay, the waves rapidly grew in size well beyond what my expertise could handle. \n\nIn an attempt to get to safer waters, I tried to paddle out past the waves which meant I first had to paddle through them. I was on a rather large board and in an effort to get through the waves crashing on me, I would roll my board to allow the wave to crash over me. The move is pretty easy, but on one rather large wave, I didn't roll quick enough and a good portion of the board was sent raging forward. My natural reaction was to hold onto the board as it was torn into the wave...the result was my shoulder being ripped out of the socket. \n\nAs I came above water I realized my shoulder was out thus making it nearly impossible to swim. Floating in the water, there was no pull for my shoulder to be suctioned backed into the socket, so my shoulder remained dislocated and my arm floating uselessly as the massive waves were crashing on me. \n\nFinally, I was able to drag myself onto my board and basically be knocked into the shore, having to pull myself on my board a few more times...again shoulder dislocated.\n\nLooking back, I think my survival mode kicked in and I found a way to live, but it certainly could have been my demise.\nTL;DR:"}

It's not unreasonable in my opinion because I can't afford an apartment, and they expect me to live with them until I get a job.  My mom says she wants me to find one within an hour or two.  This is *not fucking going to happen*.  We live in buttfuck nowhere, and I don't want to be stuck like they are.  I hate being stuck.  At school, I'm not stuck.  I can do what I want, when I want.

I become surly and unhappy and depressed.  I rarely get to see my boyfriend when I'm home and we go to college in different states.  The 10:00 curfew and the constant drilling about where I'm going to be, for how long, and with whom is getting really old.  I've been a pretty damn good kid for almost my entire life.  There were rough spots when I was 15, but that is an age at which I estimate about 90% of people go crazy for a while.  And that time is over.  They can't raise me anymore or teach me anything or give me more morals.  That stage in my life has passed.  In terms of developing who I am and what I will be, they have little to no more say as far as I am concerned.  Any attempts to assert myself and stay out for a night are met with \"Where are you?

We did a play together, kissed, were lovey dovey, and I ended up spending the night with her when she was interning at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park. We didn't have sex-- just cuddled. Since then, we met and had dinner once in 2009 and have just kept in contact over Facebook. And we have not communicated regularly. \n\nShe is with a long term boyfriend, but messaged me in January saying \"We should get drinks this year!\". She lives in Brooklyn, so I thought the most polite thing to do would be to say that if I'm around, I'll let you know. She has said this sort of thing to me in the past, and I have basically given her the same response. \n\nI don't think I would be satisfied with just catching up. We likely won't end up in a romantic relationship and I can only really think about her romantically.

My boyfriend, who we'll call Tyler and I (22 F) have been together for almost two and a half years and have been planning on going camping next month for a couple of weeks. Recently, his brother moved in with us. Well call him Dan. Dan and I get along just fine, I consider him my brother. I haven't met his girlfriend (15/16 F)\n\nI'm not sure when exactly, but a couple of weeks ago I had mentioned to Tyler that for our camping trip, I would prefer that it be just me and him, as this was going yui be our first big vacation together. He agreed. Fast forward to today. I was in the other room during this conversation so I didn't find out until after the fact. Tyler was telling Dan about our trip and ended up inviting him and his girlfriend to join us. \n\nI was really hurt, so I asked Tyler about it, as I was under the impression that we were on the same page. Tyler immediately apologized and said that he forgot. \n\nI believe 100% that he didn't do this on purpose and had just forgotten about our conversation. He said that Dan and his girlfriend don't have to come with us.\n\nHere is where I'm conflicted. I can either tell him to uninvite Dan and keep the trip just Tyler and me. However I would feel to guilty to really enjoy myself add much I would normally. Option two is to let Dan and his girlfriend come, and just not have a good time cause I will just be sad the will whole time because it won't be the trip I wanted.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm just being selfish and overreacting our if I'm justified in feeling upset.\n\nAny advice from you guys would be great.\n\nAlso, another note that may be relevant. I suffer from depression and recently had an issue with my insurance and wasn't able to get a refill on my medication. So I've been without my antidepressants for a week now.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been dating K for two and a half years, and we've broken up several times because he feels overwhelmed.  I can understand this; I don't come from a well off family and have had to drop out of school to recover my finances.  With a lot of financial pressure on my end, he felt obligated to help me out...which turned into me depending on him a lot more than I wanted to.  Food.  Rides (I don't have a car.) Etc.\n\nFor a while I lost my job because our business wasn't doing well enough, and my boss had to let people go.  I got a new job recently and am finally making more money than I'm spending.  How do I show K that I don't want to be a burden to him anymore?  I try and bring him little surprises, but he just doesn't appreciate them anymore; it used to be that he at least thanked me.\n\nI think the financial issues have led him to stop seeing me as attractive. He doesn't compliment me anymore, and sex is minimal.  What do?  I stay with him often because I feel like my emotional contributions are what's keeping us together.  I feel awful because he's always depressed, and I know I've been a huge contribution to it.\nTL;DR:"}

[f/30 & m/31]\nPOST: Hi,\n\nI have been with my SO about a year and lived together for around 6 months. We work really well together and it's a great, loving relationship.\n\nThe issue that I have is his snoring. \n\nWe live in a small one bedroom property and we only have room for a two seat sofa in our lounge. We are short on space and moving is not an option right now. We've shared a bed every night since we started living together and I always knew he snored. I accepted it and bought some good ear plugs.\n\nRecently I have started to take some long term meds for chronic anxiety and one of the side effects is that I don't sleep as deeply and it takes me longer to nod off. Subsequently his snoring is much more apparent and it's becoming a real issue.\n\nI usually prod him to wake him up but this results in him getting cross (understandably) and one of us ending up sleeping on the uncomfortable sofa for the sake of a good night's sleep (we both are career people and work full time). Last night he swore in frustration and jumped out of bed, really pissed off because he was so tired.\n\nWe are both tired, grumpy and it's not helping that we are missing out on the intimacy of sharing a bed as we are both very tactile. I'm crap on little sleep and feel like I am living in a constant fog. It causes us both to snap when we are cranky.\n\nWe have tried doctors (they just say loose weight, which he is doing), nose strips, sprays, gels and all manner of voodoo. Nothing helps. He snores from the throat rather than the nose so it doesn't matter how he sleeps. Have looked up sleep clinics but they are VERY expensive\n\nI know it's not his fault but I can start to feel tiny pangs of resentment. I love him to bits and wouldn't change anything else apart from this one thing. What on earth do I do? Is this what I have to accept for the rest of my life?\nTL;DR:"}

During this relationship things were good, until she started being online at weird times of the day, constantly saying she was busy etc. Which at first I didnt care about, but then it was all the time. Eventually I find out that she wasn't actually busy, she was just busy talking to other guys. To make things worse when I called her out on it the first time (when I was just suspecting things, before I had solid proof) she went crazy saying how could I question her love and saying that I have to trust her. Obviously this made things even more of a kick in the teeth when I really found out, that she got angry at me for questioning her loyalty, even tho she was indeed not being loyal. \n\nAnyway. My new GF who I love very much and am much more compatible with is starting to do the same odd things that my ex started doing to begin with. Ie making excuses to sound busy, yet seeing she is on facebook talking to someone the whole time. So I asked why she was on FB when she said she had to go do something and that she would talk to me later and she said almost the exact same thing that my ex did (you have to trust me). Its like deja vu. But I know I've got trust issues(I've had an odd past, of being constantly let down and misled, outside of relationships too that gave me trust issues), and I know my judgement is clouded because I'm panicking to save myself from getting my heart broken again. \n\nI want to mention my current GF admitted to kissing another guy when she was with her Ex. Also that she leaves her phone around and I see this same guy sending her messages multiple times(I try to tell myself to relax and that its probably just a guy friend, but its hard). Which only adds fuel to the fire of panic in my head.\n\nI don't want to start questioning my GF's love for me and putting unnecessary strain on our relationship before its even begun.\nTL;DR:"}

Anyways, we drove there without incident and I started to get the general clean. It wasn't the actual doctor, but some assistant. She seemed new (intern, maybe?) and she was scraping my teeth with the slow precision of someone dismantling a bomb. She was leaning *so close* to my mouth, like, her nose was almost touching my front teeth (significant because Chinese noses). While she was scraping away, I just had a random thought... \"I wonder what would happen if I just headbutted her right now\". The look of unbroken concentration, the little wrinkle scar on her neck... I mean, she just looked... so headbuttable. \n  \nI didn't end up headbutting her, but the more I thought about it, the more amused I became. I started by smiling, then giggling, then by little laughs that sounded more like \"meeeeeeep\" because the assistant still had her hands (and nose) in my mouth. Soon, I was stifling violent spasms of laughter and the dentist chair was shaking because I was failing. The doctor herself came in to see what was wrong, and at that exact moment, I could no longer hold in my mirth. I started wailing with laughter, and everyone in the office and waiting room could hear it. They ended up cutting the appointment short because I couldn't compose myself enough to let them finish.

We were together before the job, we live together, we have a baby together as well as my 3.5 and 5 year olds from a previous relationship. We're monitored minimally at best. We've had a long struggle with him always wanting to look at porn (not even real porn, just pictures of other girls, selfies and whatnot), but I recently found out that for at least a week (could be and probably is longer) he's taken to picking up a public wifi signal on his phone that doesn't have service so that he can look at this stuff at his desk. Not sure if he's actually making a trip to the bathroom to finish but he used to pleasure himself at work in the bathroom before his service was turned off anyway. I absolutely can't stand it. It feels stomach-turning to think that he's so desperate to look at porn without the possibility of me noticing that he's sneaking it at his desk and lying. Am I completely in the wrong for having an issue with this as he's suggested, for either the porn at work, the lying, or both? I honestly don't know what to feel anymore, it's bothered me and hurt me for all of the common reasons for so long that I'm almost numb to it. I don't usually have an issue with the concept of porn, jerkin' it, etc., but the way he goes about keeping it his deepest, darkest secret, lying to my face about it, doing it at desks, parking lots at fast food places with free wifi, for some reason this element just gives me anxiety attacks.

I don't feel nervous when starting a conversation with a stranger, giving a performance on stage, or voicing an unpopular opinion in a group setting.  Sometimes I find that I am too independent; if I had plans to go to a bar with a friend and they cancel I'll still go alone, or if I'm in the mood to eat at a restaurant I'll go by myself.  I'm happy with who I am and my opinion of me is not altered by what others think.  \n\nAlthough that may seem like a positive attribute, I believe that one reason I am single is because I find it scary to let somebody else decide how much they care about me and define my image.  A coping mechanism I use is that whenever someone develops feeling for me, I don't believe them.  I make up excuses like \"they don't have any other female friends so I'm the only choice,\" \"they are going through a short phase, \"they want to date just to be in a relationship.\"  I'm not in touch with my emotions, so I try to logically understand why someone wants me to be their girlfriend and I have never come to a clear conclusion.  But, even if I don't understand love I shouldn't be so insecure to believe everybody who confesses their feelings for me is a fraud.  Has anybody else gone through this?  How did you get past it?  \n\nMy second question is half out of curiosity because it is something I could see myself thinking and not experienced.  It is important to respect and admire your significant other, but often times I will hear someone say that their partner is out of their league and they were lucky to be with them.  Is that a normal feeling?\nTL;DR:"}

The earliest I can really start is the 1st of September, almost 4 months away. I mentioned this in my application and confirmed it during the phone interview; albeit mentioned that I could potentially start a little earlier if absolutely necessary. I also confirmed 1st September in the second interview where they assured me that it is just so they have an idea of where I'll best fit in to their plans.\n\nThe company intends to scale up a lot over the next year (100+ people in all fields) so I don't know when how many junior developer positions they want filled and by when. I have been hoping my delayed start date shouldn't affect my chances of getting the job too much but I am a worrier and and I really want to know if it is a point of contention or not. Should I bring it up in the interview with the director on Friday? I was thinking I could express my excitement for the position, hence why I put an application in as soon as I saw the posting. I'd make him aware that I know 4 months is a long time that I would give an earlier date if I could. Then finally mention my concern that about losing the job due a restrictive start date.\n\nSorry for the rambly post. I'm just getting a little bit nervous right now.\n\nCheers.\nTL;DR:"}

I was disappointed to find that this newfound confidence did not solve all my problems--especially because I was sure that my low self-esteem was the root of all evil. \n\nMy ex used to take advantage of me very regularly. I was typically never sober/too weak to say no. I adamantly avoided sex with him, but I could never fully escape it--mainly because of guilt. I always felt extremely used and isolated afterwards but because it was my first relationship I had nothing to compare it to. \n\nYears later, I never thought these experiences would still affect me. Though, I guess it's because I mainly just tried to repress what happened (and why I thought the problem lie elsewhere). My boyfriend is aware of what used to go on in my previous relationship and never pressures me. He's so kind and I absolutely trust him, yet there are still sometimes I hesitate to be touched. I hate feeling this way. \n\nHow can I work through these feelings? How can I communicate better with my partner to overcome this?\nTL;DR:"}

We talked it over like mature (naive?) adults and she said she needed some time to think about things. I took this as all but a straight No but reamined positive since I knew that nomatter what she said I would eventually feel better than continuing to lie to her and myself. \n\nA week passed and we met up for a drink and managed to not even mention this despite talking for hours. We eventually revealed to each other that this sort of this is, as a matter of fact, a very difficult subject to bring up and we would talk it over in almost another week. We met up again last monday and after some conversational fumbling I was able to raise the subject. she told me that she (surprise surprise) had never thought of me or the time we had spent together in \"that way\". She said that she cant commit to anything right now. When asked, she said that she wasn't in the right place for a relationship and it was not me that was the problem. Against my better judgement I honestly believe her. I sent her a few texts/facebook messages etc to say that I understood how she felt and while it would nto be easy for me I agreed to her insistance that we remain friends, a situation that makes sense because we have to see each other almost every day at Uni however weird that situation may be. \n\nI decided that it would be best if we didn't see each other until we returned to Uni and she agreed that some time apart could well be what I need to adjust. \n\nHere is my problem, I have arranged to see her sometime this weekend (having moved back to uni).

A couple months have past and with that, my performance has increased, but I'm feeling that every time we're alone, I'm obligated to have sex with her. Knowing her, she has a very high sex drive, which lead me to think that maybe I don't have as low of a sex drive. The thing is though, I can only recall a few times in the past couple months where I personally wanted to initiate and have sex. It's concerning me that I won't be able to keep up to my partner in the future and that currently, I'm not completely satisfying her. Apart from the bedroom, there are times when she likes to, for instance,  kiss my face or stomach and I always find myself getting irrational and irritated. Apart from the sexual portion of our relationship, we are a strong couple who have been together through alot and I couldn't have asked for a better partner in that regard. What should I do?

Being Jewish, I went home from college to be with my family for the full mourning session (which is a week after the funeral in which we sit Shiva). The grief and depression are hitting me now, when I'm away from all my family and all alone.\n\nAs a result, I missed a week and a half of classes.  The week I got back, was the week of my midterms. Not only did I have to catch up with all my work, but I had to study for my midterms and write two research papers. Meanwhile, I'm going to all my classes and I've been completely lost because of how much I've missed. I've been back for a week. I bombed one of my midterms and think I did decently on my others. I still have to write one of my research papers and continue to catch up on reading for other classes. \n\nI'm also moving.

And I'm nervous about getting along with my new roommate and getting acclimated with a new environment.\n\nEverything seems to be building up and I keep breaking down.

Everything has been amazing, and even when things aren't, we work through them together. We physically, emotionally, and mentally stimulate each other in ways that neither of us have ever felt before. To say that we're serious is an understatement. However, there is one issue we're both trying to deal with, but I seem to be having a bit more trouble than she is.\n\nThe Problem: Before we started dating, we hung out quite a bit. We had the type of friendship where we could sit for hours on end just talking and never get bored. During this time, we both talked about our past relationships a lot, including the sex. It wasn't uncommon for us to go into get detail as we tried to one up each others sexual exploits. After we started dating and becoming more serious, this came back to bite us in the ass. She has her moments, but she seems to be coping well enough. I, however, have a terribly vivid imagination.\n\nAdditional Details: We've talked about this problem together, and we both always come out of the conversation feeling better. I tend to let it get to me more often than she does, so I end up bringing it up more frequently. I'm trying my best to deal with this because it's not fair to her that I keep digging up the past. I want to fix this, for both of our sake.\n\nA Bit More About Me Specifically: I don't care that she's been with other guys. I love her and accept her for who she is, and I wouldn't change a thing. My problem is that I know details that I wish I didn't. Every so often, a terrible mental image of her and one of her exs invades my mind, and I can't get rid of it. It doesn't help that she's an amazing woman and most of her exs were scumbags.\n\nThe Question: Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with detailed mental images of my girlfriend with other guys? The best I've come up with is that my imagination is probably worse than the real thing, but it doesn't seem to help.\nTL;DR:"}

Whilst sitting in her basement watching TV I got the worst feeling in my gut I have ever felt. I knew it was time. I got up, said nothing, and speed walked to her bathroom. I sat down, relaxed, and let nature do its work. However, what I didn't expect was the greatest storm of shame I have ever known to come blasting out of my butt. This storm of nastiness was accompanied by a 12 inch shame snake of poo. After releasing this behemoth I catch my breath, spray some air freshener, and flush the toilet. It plugs. I quickly clean myself up so I can stand and try to assess the situation, but what I see makes me lose all hope. A massive chocolate mess is staring back at me and I can see just the head of my shame snake peaking out. At this point I'm freaking out so I grab the plunger and start going at it like I'm churning chocolate butter. Bonus points: In this process I accidentally dipped my tie in the mess (yes I wear ties, they look nice). I keep plunging but it won't flush!

I don't know how everyone has all of this motivation to do things in life. It's like I lack the intrinsic motivation that just keeps everyone else going.  I'm a third year student at a big university. The only real motivation I've found for continuing my studies is that it will hopefully give me a better life down the line, but it's a long shot. I'm double majoring in English and Psychology because I had no clue what I wanted to do and thought that covering more ground would give me more career opportunities. None of these things really interest me that much though. And it's not just a matter of finding the right area to study, because none of them jump out any more than the rest as being what I want to do, it's more that these two suck less than the rest of them. I've just been struggling with the meaninglessness of everything.\nHonestly, the only real motivation I've found for life, is having a family or a meaningful relationship down the line. I view everything as a means to get me to that goal. But such an extremely long-term goal makes it quite difficult to force myself to buckle down on things in the short-term.

We have a similar perspective of life and click with most things but I feel im her verbal punching bag alot of the time and when she does stop and apologizes it just happens again half and hour later.\nTL;DR:"}

She added/messaged them on facebook while we were staying at the hospital, and they got pretty well acquainted, though they have never met IRL. \n\nFast forward to today, and they volunteered to take us to a local theme park (they have free visitor passes) so we and our kids can unwind.  \n\nI was flabbergasted.  Such generosity, such niceitude!\n\nMy wife, however, will not go.\n\nHer excuse is that she feels fat and ugly compared to them.  They are professional wrestlers, and are pretty fit.

I try to make her feel pretty as often as possible.\n\nI would like to take both kids, but I can only really lug one around the park by myself (work friends also have kids), so I'm going to have to decline their offer (they have invited us to stuff in the past, but I have had to decline for similar reasons).\n\nI'm concerned that she may be too obsessed with her appearance.  When I asked her about it, she says (and I quote)  \"Want me to be confident? Help me achieve it!  I want braces.  And I want free time to work out at night and a study partner to help me further my career.\"  Basically, it seems like she is giving me an ultimatum -- buy her braces, watch the kids after work for a couple of hours while she goes to the gym, and tutor her for college -- or she will never do anything with people she doesn't know, i guess.\n\nAm I being unreasonable in thinking that this is a huge red flag?\nTL;DR:"}

I don't see my maternal cousins too often, maybe 2 or 3 times a year. Their aunt (my uncle's wife) tells me how excited they are when I come by, but when I babysit them, they seem miserable the whole time when they aren't in front of the TV. go for a walk? boring. go to forest? boring. play catch or use their trampoline? Fun, but after 10 minutes they ask when they can watch a movie. And when I finally acquiesce, they put on an Adam Sandler movie they've seen 5 times already AND have their  iPhones in front of them. I think it's clear that their parents spoil them, even if they aren't super well off. I'm not sure if I should just chalk this up to childhood inattention since I certainly remember wanting to play N64 a lot, but I feel like I wasn't this bratty about it. \n\nSo I'm wondering what I should do in this situation.

I don't want to.\nPOST: Ok, a little back story.\n\nI got on bc within the first 6 months of us dating because we both agreed that we wanted to take better precaution against getting pregnant. The pill that I was on was low hormone (can't remember the brand off hand, will find out and post later). I had nothing but negative side effects from the birth control. I was depressed, moody, and had absolutely no sex drive whatsoever. I would cry all the time for the smallest stuff. Our sex life severely suffered because I was never in the mood which was the main reason I hated being on it. I didn't feel like myself. After about a year of being on the pill, we both decided that it wasn't for me and that we would go back to using condoms. I have been bc free for about 6 months and he just informed me that he wants me to get back on bc to \"ease his mind.\" I told him I am not completely opposed to birth control but I don't want to be on the same birth control I was on. I mentioned an IUD but I have not done a lot of research on them. Also, I do not have insurance, and the only kind of bc I can get are pills from my local clinic so he wants me to save up and buy the IUD if that is the route we decided to go. I honestly do not want to be back on birth control. We use condoms now and that works for me, and I thought it was working for him, too (obviously not).

I should start by saying that I love her and want whats best for her no matter what. Since she has made these claims repeatedly I have been feeling different about the relationship and feel lost as to how we should move forward. \n\nSo... ALIENS. A topic of heated debate. I wouldn't ever say that aliens don't exist, statistically they must. As well there is quite a bit of evidence of UFO's, especially with many countries disclosing such information. I would not rule out the existence of such but as well I can't just watch a documentary like Sirius and claim that aliens visit our planet and communicate with us. That's just who I am, I'm a skeptic. \n\nHer experiences are interesting. They occur when she is about to sleep. She will be visited by 'something' incredibly scary like a black figure in the room or a floating face appears. Another time she told me that a reptilian was giving her oral forcefully (she had stated this was a dream at first then recently claims that it was real). For me, I hear these stories and reason that they must be nightmares. She holds fast that they are really happening though.\n\nMy main issue is that I don't entirely believe her. She claims that these are multi-dimensional alien beings visiting her and wanting to cause her pain. I cannot get on board with that as I have never had an experience like that. I want to support her but how can I do that when she says that it is real when I say it was more than likely a dream? Any comments will be helpful.\nTL;DR:"}

She asked me if I would be in a relationship about a month before x-mas, and I accepted since I was going back to the states for that time. We had a good time. In fact, we love each other, but I'm in the service and I won't be finished for another 18 months. On the last day, we talked about pursuing the LDR thing. We concluded that we should basically push pause until I get out of the service. We did this to avoid unnecessary pressure to make things work and cause resentment.

In recent months it has progressed to watching calorie and nutrient intake, and focusing on muscle groups (I'm training to be an aerialist) but there are two things that are holding me back.\n\n1. What is the most calorie effective \"bang for your buck\" alcoholic drink to drink? I realize all of the implications that question begs, but here's the long and short of it. My work and personal friends often converge on bars/pubs to bond and unwind after gigs. I've managed to stave away from the pub food permanently but can't seem to find a low-guilt option for a drink. I'm a red wine drinker, but understand that the carbs and sugar from that is not the best for dropping weight. In general I've cut my alcohol intake drastically already but I can't help but know how bad drinking my calories is.\n\n2. I have and always have had (really, really really) large breasts my whole life and no amount of weight loss or training has ever changed them. At my lowest weight last summer (~125, with D / DD), I looked like an awkward barbie doll. I dropped /maaaaybe/ a cup size when I was working out, but still looked dangerously top-heavy. Body weight exercises and dramatically healthier diet kept them nearly a cup size lower than what I normally am, but any amount of heavy work outs or food consumption outside of the strictest guidelines and they were back to normal. Any suggestions?\n\nThe second is the most vain of my goals. I am already so happy with my overall health increase and being able to wear shirts that show my tummy, but knowing my recreation after hours won't catch up with my fitness would be nice, and looking dainty and perhaps even demure instead of sexy and risqu\u00e9 in just tshirts would send me over the moon.\n\nSorry this got so long. >.>\nTL;DR:"}

I am 100% certain this person is trying to cheat. I am not certain if they've been successful. I know they have not been successful with me, but it has not been for a lack of trying. For about 4 years now I am contacted and propositioned regularly by this person. We dated (code word for hooked up) briefly before he was married. His marriage was sudden and I really don't know much about his wife. He and his family have known me and my family for about 20 years, but it's because we grew up in church together. His father was the leader of our congregation for about 10 years and his mother was my Sunday school teacher for a few years.

Yesterday one of our friends told me the girl invited some of them to drink and i jokingly answered \"well if I didn't get an invite I ought to go out with my other friends\", to which my friend admitted that the girl told her that the night we went out she got into a heated argument with one of her friends because she has a thing for me, so now I fear the girl I like is wondering how to approach me about this, because I'm not meant to know this and I have no clue who the hell else is interested into me besides her, and I don't understand why her friend is being such a child, I didn't \"choose\", nobody but the girl I'm seeing has shown interest in me so it makes sense that I'd want to pursue her.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Should I stay in my long distance relationship?\nPOST: So, I am currently in a long distance relationship with a girl who lives in France. We've been together for almost a year now and we've both done so much for each other. We've been there for each other through bad days, tragedies and so many other meaningful things. We even put off sleep so we can spend more time with each other over Skype calls and online video games. I love her very much and vice versa. Sadly, I am currently in a state of life where a lot of things are changing for me. I am meeting a lot of new people and I am reaching a point where I have to start to experience the real world. (These are things I won't go into detail about for anonymity reasons.) I think to myself that it might be time to be more open to people in the community around me in the physical world instead of focusing so much on her. Which is an extremely hard decision to make. I really do love her so much and she's grown a bit attached to me if you catch my drift. Not in an annoying way, but in a way that she can get upset easily when making me slightly annoyed. (I have discussed this with her and we are working on changing that frame of mind for mental health purposes.) I am pretty much torn between staying in a long distance relationship with someone I may not even ever meet if either of our lives make it impossible, or I can leave the girl that I love so much behind in search for someone that I have a better chance of having a true relationship with.

One of them was to write letters to our sister school in Japan in Japanese, and then our pen pal could reply in English, as a way to practice. I was a bit of mischief maker and wanted to include a little joke in my letter (I obviously wasn't thinking too clearly at the time). I wrote in Japanese \"My current hobbies are building websites, if you wouldn't mind, please check out my newest website!\" and then inserted a link to goatse.cx.\n\nLittle did I know, that all the letters get checked first by the Japanese teacher. So he was in the staff room and tried to view 'my website' out of curiosity. Unfortunately the website was blocked, so then the Japanese teacher asked the principal to view it on her computer because her computer had all-access. I guess you guys can work out the rest.\n\nAfter the incident, I was forced to see the school counsellor twice a week for 4 weeks in which I had to convince him I didn't make the website. Luckily back then, people weren't as technologically savvy so I managed to convince the counsellor that my website was hacked.\n\nThat Japanese teacher became one of my closest mentors and I still meet up with him for drinks 15 years out of high school. We talked about this incident recently and he said he was never allowed to do the pen pal project ever again after that. I felt terrible :(\nTL;DR:"}

He is very ambitious and career-driven and has basically shut down the idea of a relationship at all until out of the Army. \n\nHowever, our connection has gotten stronger and we have spent several weekends together, including him buying me a plane ticket to see him, and a train ticket to his hometown to visit while he was spending time with family before leaving the country. I am planning to travel to where he is in about a month to see him, then travel on my own for a while. \n\nMy issue is in handling the total uncertainty about where we are going. I have taken a lot of effort to not pressure him about us, not because I am afraid to, but because I prefer  to let things unfold organically and I don't think healthy relationships grow by force. I also don't necessarily WANT a long-distance relationship, so I'm not pushing it, but if he brought it up I would be willing to pursue it.\n\nI'm just not sure how to proceed as I feel kinda stuck between two options: see where things go, which makes me feel anxious and nervous, yet is what I really want to do, or bring this up, which I don't really want to do right now, but might give me a bit of peace.\nTL;DR:"}

I landed this job through a contact I had made last year who recognized my name on Craigslist (I post my resume there) and invited me in after a few phone conversations..one thing led to another and they created a part-time temporary job for me. I'll be doing mostly grunt work at first helping on projects, then at some point doing marketing and research. \n\nIt's only a few days a week at first, gradually easing into more towards full-time without benefits after a month...with the \"trial period\" over after 3 months. Naturally I accepted the offer without question right now just to get my foot in the door. The pay is not great and there are no benefits for now but I couldn't care less at the moment - it's something.\n\nThat being said, at the end of the trial period, how should I go about negotiating pay? It will be hourly rate and there are no specific \"conditions\" in terms of their pay scales - they keep them purposely flexible in relation to how well the company is doing. I was even told there is no real \"upper limit\" if the company is doing great and I've made a very valuable contribution.\n\nAny thoughts on how I should think about negotiating when the time comes? Things to look for from them? Cues and hints? I've never had to negotiate a job situation quite like this - the only jobs I've had before have been *very* cut and dry in terms of salary and benefits so I have no real good idea of how hard-ball to play at 3 months or whether to approach them first with an idea, and so on.

My SO [30-m] and I [27-f] have been together for a little over a year.  I don't remember when exactly, but at some point I started sending him 'naughty' pictures.  He loved it!  I've done it around 6 times now I think, so about once every couple of months. The response became less and less enthusiastic every time.  The last time I sent some, I felt like I was being flirty and sexy and just a bit of a tease since he was out with his friends. But he didn't respond, at all.  When we spoke the next day (he got home after I was asleep), I asked him how his night went, he said it was fun and he had gotten \"distracted\" a couple of times.  Me:  \"Oh yeah..why's that?\"  Him: \"Well I got this message while my phone was sitting on the table for everyone to see.\" Me:  \"Oh.  I'm sorry, I hope it wasn't annoying or embarrassing.\" Him: \"No, it was okay.\"    Done.  I said later that it wouldn't happen again and he seemed pretty happy with that.  \n\nSo what the hell, reddit?  Why doesn't he want me doing this anymore?  I thought it was sexy and guys liked this kind of thing. \n\nProblem#2 that stemmed from this.  I'm having a moment of insecurity. I feel less sexy, or at least less sexy to him. But if I talk to him about this and I'm all insecure and needing to be reminded that he thinks I'm sexy, then that just makes me even less sexy because insecurity is about as far from sexy as you can get.  So what's the solution?  I need a little bit of a reminder from him that he thinks I'm hot, but I can't just tell him that's what I need without making the situation worse.   I've even found myself tempted to get this kind of reminder from one of my guy friends.\nTL;DR:"}

For the first year of our relationship, everything was perfect and it seemed like the honeymoon period was never going to end. No fights, we always had fun adventures together, and we made each other incredibly happy.\n\nWe moved into a house together in May, thinking it was the best option and we were super excited about it. However, things started to go downhill a few months after that. My job sent me into a deep depression, the bills and chores were overwhelming and he didn't like to be nagged about them, he was stressed about his job, and we fell into a routine. \n\nHe stopped acting interested in me - wouldn't kiss or cuddle, didn't want to go on dates or adventures, and I knew something was wrong. After several discussions about this, he finally admitted he no longer felt romantically interested in me, although he was still very sexually interested and still had fun spending time with me.\n\nHe feels like this is grounds for a breakup - but I feel like it is just a normal occurrence when you move in with someone and share your life to the extent that we do. I feel like if he put effort into it - doing the things we used to do, like taking trips together, taking dance lessons, hiking, etc - he would feel those feelings again. We just need to break out of the routine we're in.\n\nWhat do you think? Is he right in that those feelings are gone for good, or do you think there is a way to get them back?

So her actual monthly expenditures dropped $800 right there.\n\nPrompted, however, by her sudden realization of a disastrous financial situation, she also moved to make other changes and succeeded.  She altered her mortgage payments to paying only a single principle payment (as opposed to two) in addition to the interest, and paused her RSP contributions (for now).\n\nWith those three major changes, it's a very different financial picture,  and after re-examining everything, she's well into the black  month-to-month rather than more than a thousand dollars in the red.\n\nSo I'm not bailing her out, and she's not going to drown in debt.  She's going to use the difference to start paying off the line of credit as fast as she can afford.\n\nI guess there are still some major issues (her hiding the debt from my dad, the fact that she still has a huge amount of debt compared to her disposable income, etc.) but they're not my problems to solve *and* I know my money won't be subsidizing my sister.\n\nThanks again for all of your help and advice.\n\n**[\nTL;DR:"}

But we were already at it so I did not say anything. I hope I don't get an infection from it, can I? \n\nAnyway, he did not even have any condoms, did not plan to use them apparently \"since my ex and I rarely used them\" but I had one on me. He lasted, well, 3 min max. \n\nAnd well, I barely felt anything the whole time. His house was also very very messy, things spilled and pet things all over the place. And I felt meh about the whole thing. Should I see him again a time or two, or end it now?\nTL;DR:"}

I didn't touch another woman because I was still healing. After telling me the details I'm upset almost daily about spontaneous thoughts of her with the other guys. It's almost obsessive but I don't choose to have these thoughts.\n\nSince we both never really got our promiscuousness out of our systems before our beginning of our relationship 3 years ago, and she took the opportunity to while she had the chance and I didn't, **my GF decided she would let me sleep around a couple of times** if that meant that we were on a level playing field sexually, and she thinks that it would make me feel less betrayed. \n\nMy GF has ideas on how this arrangement will work, like her sleeping in the spare bedroom while I go out on the town and try to pick up, take her back to our house, and fuck her in the bed me and my partner usually sleep in. I just think this is a really silly and not very thought out arrangement. But at the same time she seems really willing to support this idea and help it become a reality. She and I don't want to separate while I do this, so while the girl is over, she will just be my 'housemate'.\n\nI'm just so sure this will backfire, and I'll regret taking the opportunity, but I'm also afraid I will grow resentment over time about what happened, and also regret NOT taking the opportunity while given the chance to level the playing field!\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? Any past experiences? How did it go? And other ideas to help me than this? I'm extremely open to ideas!!!!\nTL;DR:"}

When I ended it I just realized we wanted different things and that we really didn't have much in common. We remained pretty friendly, but with little communication. After about six months I went to a different state for school and have been there for the past 2 years. I talked  to him a saw him a few times because he took the break up really hard and I was just trying to be a friend, but like I said we don't have very much to talk about and his emotional problems really weighed me down. Anyway, he's been a lot better for the past year or so, and our mutual friends assure me he has gotten over me. He has had a girlfriend since then, and I've had a boyfriend, but now we are both single. \n\nSo I just graduated and for the past couple months he has been acting weird. He's started texting me a lot more frequently which is odd because we have nothing to talk about. Then he started posting on my parents facebook pages. He wished *MY* mom a happy mothers' day, then he posted a really strange comment about my dad's birthday. He posts like he's pals with them or something. Then the other day he called me. I hardly ever speak to anyone but family on the phone, so I rejected the call and texted to ask him what was up in case it was an emergency or something. Before he responded I saw that he left a message and he was all hurt that I rejected his call and was just calling to chat. To me it sounds like a crush.\n\nAnyway, how do I nicely tell him to back off? I know he's probably just lonely, but frankly I don't really want to talk to him that much. We don't have anything in common, and when we do hang out he really irritates me. I've changed a lot since we dated and I just don't want to be friends. How do I communicate this without damaging his fragile ego?\nTL;DR:"}

Advice?\nPOST: As the title says, I can't stand looking though my pictures. I've been in two pretty good relationships, although I was never the one to end it. The first relationship lasted 3 years, the next one lasted 6 (it ended half a year ago). During most of that time I took pictures as a hobby. I never really sorted my pictures much and as a result I can't browse them without seeing my ex-girlfriends over and over again. So now I have managed to take a decade worth of pictures I don't want to look at, because it bothers me to see pictures of me happy with my ex-girlfriends. \n\nSo my questions to /r/relationships is: Does anybody else have a similar problem? Is it unhealthy to be bothered by pictures of a ex-girlfriend of 7 years ago?\nTL;DR:"}

Personally I have more or less created this small group about 4 years ago. I really enjoy being a part of this close knit group because we all share similar musical tastes and have similar hobbies.\n\nHowever lately this group have been much meaner to me than usual, they say it is part of the \"group dynamic\" that we make fun of each other. We have been a close knit group for about 4 years now and we do often playfully make fun of one another. However lately 90% of the insults are directed towards me(they even acknowledge this). \n\nMany of the insults they use often hit way to close to home with me (various medical problems I have) or are completely untrue. If I try to refute these insults which are untrue they shut me off and laugh at me even more or if I ignore it they call me \"salty\" instead. These insults are not new but before it was mutual that we all made fun of one another. \n\nSince I am a junior in high school it is not like I can completely shut them out of my life and I am sure that they wont stop making fun of me even if I asked them to stop. I have other friends I can hang out with but I have been really close with the friends who are now making fun of me and would hate to lose them.\n\nSo do you think I am overreacting and should just learn to live with it, or should I try and tell them how I feel (I have tried many times before with little to no success), or should I try and completely shut them out of my life?\nTL;DR:"}

It was really freeing as im only 18 and it was the first time we kinda took care of ourselves entirely. One of the girls I've kinda seen as just a friend but of late started to see her as a bit more. She seems kind of young in that shes always been thin, has braces and a bit of a small chest and never hooked up before. I'm not criticizing, i think shes amazing, but its just kinda made me only really see her as like a little sister. Anyway, while camping we had a really nice first night where we sat infront of the fire for 5 hours, just us. Then then the next night all 8 of us slept in the same tent and i hooked up with this girl and just kinda felt each other (not like 2nd base stuff but alot of kind of feeling) and i kind of held her until the morning. The next day everything was fine between us and we went back home, later that night i texted her saying i didnt want that night to be a one off, and kind of wanted a relationship with her, shes amazing. She replied saying she also had amazing nights but im just one of her closest friends and the timing is kind of bad (in last year of school with major exams in a few months). Im now really hung up on her, at school we have been acting normal, just as friends but i keep thinking back to our first night together. Fuck \"tapping that\" i want to hold her and talk to her and have that connection we had that night. Thanks for taking the time to actually read this and caring, this is why i love reddit!\nTL;DR:"}

I can still afford it, but I don't want to go over-budget and be irresponsible about this. \n\nDoing some more digging, I found out about Priceline's 'Name your own Price' feature - which can get you shitty flights that get you where you need to go for pretty cheap.

He said he was supposed to come home at 7, I told him I would have dinner with my parents around then but get home afterwards. He then decided to stay out longer because of this but didn't bother to tell me. His phone was dead the whole time. This morning he got online and saw my many worried messages. Told me he had been attacked on his way from the bar. Beaten up a bit but felt ok physically. He had then decided to go stay upstairs in the pub's apartment (he knows the owner), plug in his phone, drink some more and then go to sleep. I'm really angry he didn't message me at any point telling me that he would be late, and later to say he wouldn't come home. He has done this in the past, many times. Sometimes he's only 1-2 hours late, sometimes he doesn't come home at all and sleeping at a friend's place. I always tell him it's fine to be late or not come home, but that I'd like hime to tell me so I don't have to worry. He used to lead quite a self destructive life before, drinking way too much, so my worry isn't completely unwarranted. He apologized to me but said that he thought he had messaged me. I don't understand it, and I told him that. Especially since that awful thing happened to him. I don't understand how he could have thought for the remaining night that he had contacted me, since my reaction to the whole thing would have been quite strong. I'm telling him I need to understand why he acted so inconsiderate to me. But he says that he did \"mean to contact me\", so therefore it isn't a big deal. But he still didn't end up doing it, so...?! I also suspect he was a lot more drunk than he say he was. I feel a bit guilty being so angry since he was attacked, but this is a reoccurring behavior.

What do I do?\nPOST: So, I guess I'll start from the beginning, I love my girlfriend, we have (had?) a great relationship, almost always kind to me, and for the longest time I would have sworn she was the one for me. I thought she was beautiful, and would have sworn that if anything got between us, we could solve it.\n\nOver the last month, she's been irritable, and generally upset, I've tried asking her what's wrong, and she practically brushes it off or ignores her problems entirely, and refuses to explain them to me. Obviously, I'm very concerned and in distress.\n\nAbout yesterday, she comes over, she's always had nice, long hair, but now it's really short, like, shorter than my hair. She basically got a haircut without telling me at all, and I hate it. I'm fairly certain that I've told her that I never liked short hair on girls and it's a massive turn off to me, I don't know if she remembered me saying it, but she basically got one without saying anything to me at all. Nothing changed, she was still irritable, and I flatly ignored it to be polite, but it's been bothering me all this time and it's pretty much eating me up. She's had bouts of problems before, but we'd always solve it and come to a compromise- I probably wouldn't have even taken notice of how she's been acting if it wasn't for this, but it just really bothered me. I don't really know where to go from here, I just don't feel attracted to her anymore and I'm almost a little hurt she did this without saying a word to me.\nTL;DR:"}

I studied Communications with a concentration in Public Relations at college. When I graduated, I completed an unpaid internship with a small non-profit. When I finished, I decided I wanted to work PR for a charitable organization, and made plans to go back to college.\n\nI moved here to Ireland a year ago, and started a Master's program in International Peace Studies. I studied politics, conflict resolution, and humanitarian issues. I finished my thesis mid-August, and have been staying with my boyfriend and his family while we both hunt for work (he just finished a Master's, too.)\n\nI need to stay here in Ireland for the time being. My boyfriend and I are in it for the long haul, but it's too difficult to get him into the States without being married, and we're not ready for that. I can stay and work in Ireland since I graduated from a university here, so it seemed like the obvious choice.\n\nExcept there aren't any jobs here.\n\nWhen the NGO jobs proved to be few and far between, I started focusing on PR jobs. I'd be happy in PR, and I'm good at it. I have training and practical experience in Social Media, so I extended my search to that. Except those jobs are few and far between, too. Everyone wanted someone with more experience. I can't afford to do another internship, I'm an expat and I have no one to support me while I work for free.\n\nI went to a career fair recently, and a recruiter looked at my CV and said, \"Everyone's looking for PR right now. Would you consider a different field?\"\n\nI cannot afford to go back to college. I've started applying for admin. assistant jobs, but I really hoped to start my career. I'm 25. Is there any related field that I'm not thinking of?\nTL;DR:"}

A fucked up, \"incestuous\" group of friends. Every body has dated/fucked everybody else's ex's and what not. Anyway so there's one particularly annoying friend, we'll call her Trixi. Now Trixi has slept with every man in the group, including my husband. Now this was years ago, in high school and I've accepted that my husband has slept with other women that's not an issue for me. Trixi is now married to my husbands best friend, well call him, Kurby. Trixi has 3 kids by Kurby, the house with the picket fence, they both have cozy jobs... everything seems hunky dory from the outside. Whenever Trixi gets drunk, she calls or texts my husband to cry her problems. When she feels like my husband hasn't talked to her enough she sends him whiny texts accompanied by old pictures she's kept of them. Another thing I've learned to accept because \"That's just Trixi, she gets like that\". Well recently she's also taken to telling other female members of our \"group\" that she's in love with my husband and he should have married her, and that ever having Kids with Kurby was a mistake, That my son should be hers, etc...... At this point I'm allowed to be bothered right? I know my husband loves me, and I'm not worried about him cheating, but knowing she's in love with him and dealing with her in a social setting on a constant basis really bothers me.

She is constantly complaining about college/her friends/\"I'm soooo ugly omggg\"/etc. She has more or less driven a wedge between me and my other college best friend and some of our classmates due to past, messy drama. Alot of our conversations tend to be shallow and consisting of just her moaning about everything that's wrong. At first I would entertain it and try help but lately I've kinda given up and more or less ignore it or give short answers to try and give a hint to stop. On an occasion or two I have said things like \"oh my god can you get a grip\" and that obviously makes things much worse lol. She cries a few times weekly over small things and confides in me. I feel bad because for a lot of these things I just genuinely don't care and don't see why I should have to deal with these tiny problems, most of which are her own fault and she can't see.\n\nI find it hard to think of nice ways to tell her to stop/see that a person who is constantly whinging is unappealing, especially considering she gets offended so easily. What's more is that we have dabbled sexually in the past and she has often told me/called me saying she loves me etc when drunk while I know that I have never flirted or blatantly led her on, just been a close friend to her. She then just ignores this when I don't reciprocate the feeling back and then does it like a month later again.\nTL;DR:"}

Since red locks are rare, I went down the hallways looking and sure enough, I found a red lock that unlocked with my combination.

Right???\n\nMinutes later I was then called to the front office and accused of stealing this girls lock.\n\nI explained the situation and felt confident that I was totally right. During the conversation, the girl I took the lock \"back\" from said \"Just call my parents, we wrote the combination down at home and it's on the fridge.\" They called. It was the same combination. I was totally dumbfounded, and my credibility went out the window after her parents confirmed the combination. I did not have the lock combinations written down at home or anything, so I was confirmed to be the bad guy.\n\nI later found out that the locks were not even from the same manufacturer, and looked very slightly different on the faces.

In the middle of August, I met with one of the associate vice presidents in charge of our company's e-learning division who told me that the company would be acquiring a new LMS (different than the one I train in) and gauged my interest about a possible position change. \n\nI was receptive and starting researching the product.  I continued to email back and forth and meet periodically with the VP, was able to gain admin access to a sandbox of the new product, started going through admin training and after a while, I was told to get my resume ready and that the job would be posted soon.\n\nSo last week, my boss asked me about this other position. I explained that the job hadn't been posted and that I didn't really have a time frame as to when this other thing might happen.  My boss said that the VP had \"handpicked\" me and had given him the go ahead to put in a requisition for my replacement so that I could start this new position on the 16th of December. Now, they are making the final decision on my replacement by Friday, but the VP hasn't come out and said you have the job and I don't have an official offer letter with salary or location or detailed responsibilities.\n\nI also filled in the VP about the plans to replace me and he said he would follow up with my boss without giving any more information. He did, however, give me another project to do which will be hard to complete in a timely manner in addition to my other responsibilities.\n\nSo, my question is: should I be worried about the position I'm in or is this just a lot of behind-the-scenes corporation bullshit? Also, do I have any recourse other than just waiting?\nTL;DR:"}

Last night, my fiance was asleep and he left his phone sitting on the table and I was feeling insecure. He had been texting this person. We'll call her J. Shes the girlfriend of one of our friends. The messages made me nauseous.

I confronted him in the middle of the night while I was packing my things to leave. He was obviously upset and he says he felt very stupid. He says they never did anything other than text and he is so ashamed. I later found out he had sent her pictures of his dick. \n\nIve packed my things and I'm staying in the motel for now, I just don't know what to do or how to feel. I don't know if I can forgive him, i feel so betrayed. I know he didn't actually cheat physically but it almost feels like it.\nTL;DR:"}

He often zones out during conversations and doesn't remember ones he had just a few minutes ago (and not just with me, this is kind of a thing he's known for). \n\nThis leads to a lot of things becoming more stressful than they need to. It also makes it very difficult to rely on him to do things, like going to the store or reaching out to our friends. So I kind of handle most of the housework (including finances) while he does the cooking (which he's great at). \n\nIt's not that he can't function, but it sucks that I can't rely on him. He's tried to keeping a calendar on his phone etc. and while it's a little better, it's not changing most things. Even pretty small things have been becoming larger freakouts for him, like if he forgets to schedule a haircut or that he scheduled one, he'll lose it entirely. Or get very crestfallen if anyone points out that he's forgotten they made plans to get together.\n\nHe's off for the summer and said he would talk to a doctor about seeing if he has ADHD, since he's said he thinks that's what been going on his whole life. But now his break's over and it didn't happen. He doesn't like doctors in general and tends to treat medicine as a personal failure. Part of it was that he had some other health issues, so I didn't want to constantly bring it up on top of that.\n\nI've tried talking with friends who are on ADHD meds that have helped them tremendously. I can't force him to do anything of course, but there are times where I'm starting to resent him and feel like I'm more of a parent than partner.\nTL;DR:"}

Everything was going smoothly and uphill and amazingly until the summer before he left for his first abroad semester.  I've got a pretty gnarly/messed up past and I have had to go through a lot of therapy to learn to trust people again, and he is my first bf since my life took a serious turn in high school.  But basically before he left, I had a break down and he was completely unsupportive, which crushed me, which I also told him at a later date, and he was also pretty indifferent about.  With everything else he is just the happiest and most amazing guy, but I honestly would give all that up if he could be compassionate about this event (unexpected death).  Well this sort of rough water was relaxed by the fact we were apart for almost 6 months, but now we are in Italy together, living right next door to each other and now I find myself questioning.  And on top of that, stress makes him mean, and right now he wants to nothing more than to get the fuck out of Italy.  The constant negative energy is starting taking a tole me.  I have been thinking about talking to him about taking a break, but every time I bring up our relationship, he turns into an angel for about 48 hours.  Rinse and repeat.  Not sure if I want out (or a break) now or if I should wait out the summer until we are back in the States at school.\nTL;DR:"}

How do I approach this situation?\nPOST: Hi Redditors of Reddit, There is this girl. She is wonderful and amazing. I am head over heels for her but I feel like I am running myself into a trap. We have so much in common. She is Taiwanese but was born in Australia, I'm not Taiwanese but I did grow up in Asia, so it is easy to connect with her and she has mentioned that I am easy to talk to. Anyway, moving on. She has a boyfriend that lives back in Taiwan. They only started dating once she moved here, so it is more of an online relationship and she often complains about it. We started hanging out and it seems like she is attracted to me and everyone around us thinks we are dating or that we are cute together. She is constantly leaning on me, we go out together, I can put my arm around her and all that... No problem there. Here's where the problem is. When we are not together, it's almost as if she isn't interested in me anymore. She always seems to have something better to do. We Skype at night before we go to sleep but during the day, it's as if she doesn't even know me. I don't know how to approach the situation. Do I make a move? Do I try to just move on? I don't want to ruin the friendship we have, but I also don't want to be cut short of something great... What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

A million red flags, so I'd rather not waste my time, and told him it was best if we didn't see each other anymore and to please not contact me.\n\nAnyway, we haven't talked in a month and a half, but we have tickets to a comedy event next week.

I feel a little upset that I wasted $100 on these tickets but don't want to cause any commotion. Would it be inappropriate to reach out to his brother and see if he would like the tickets? I'm not sure if he even told his brother that we aren't talking. I would rather not talk to him about it, because I feel like I've moved past the situation for the most part.

So this one girl stuck out particularly to me. We started talking on reddit, then eventually we moved to talking on kik.\nThe only problem is I found out that I knew this girl! She goes to my high school and I never pictured her to be the kind that posts on Gone Wild! My kik is sort of anonymous so she doesn't know it's me. We know each other well enough and she would recognize me if I sent a picture of myself. We've kept it clean on kik so far and she still thinks she's talking with someone she doesn't know. In real life she's a pretty cool person, someone who I would think about dating.\nI really want to get to know her and maybe even date her. I don't want her to freak out if I reveal myself and say that I'm the guy from reddit because she posted on GW. And I would NEVER spread the pics around school because I'm not an ass hole. I did tell my two best friends because I know for certain that they could keep this a secret.\nSo, I am wondering how I should approach this. Should I tell her on kik that I know her, should I tell her in person, or should I just talk to her and forget about the whole talking on the internet thing? Also, when do you think all of this should happen. I'd like to be able to ask her to homecoming at the end of October so, yeah... Any help is greatly appreciated. Also, if you have any questions about the situation, just ask and I'll be more than happy to answer them!\nAnd no, I won't give out her username.\nTL;DR:"}

We agreed that we harbored no hard feelings toward each other and frequently ran into each other at shows/parties/the like and it was always totally friendly.\nHe kept on asking me to do one-on-one stuff though *(some of our regular activities while we were dating, like a particular local sushi place and stuff)*, and I didn't want to, so I did my best to kindly decline. He eventually confronted me on the matter and let the conversation drop with an \"I'll see you around.\" But today I got a message from him via Facebook:\n\n> look idk whats up but some dude has been texting me how i should leave you alone or else he'll kick my ass/show up at my work?(*he inserted the phone number here*) idk what this is but i don't want it or the drama. i just wanted to see my friend man, suffering from extreme glibarvardrawls *(a weird combination of my last name+'withdrawals')*. but its clear i'm looking for something that isn't there. this is the last you'll hear from me.\n\nNow I have no idea who this phone number belongs to, who would even say that, or why this would even be said. There were never hard feelings between myself and my ex and I never brought up his texting me as a problem to anyone. I called the number, sent them a text. No reply. I called and sent him a text. Nothing; it even looks like he blocked me on Facebook. I asked our mutual friends (his best friends are still great friends to me). I talked to his sister (she and I still hang out).

There was a lake nearby with a stream feeding it. \n\nWe decided to go walk around on the ice for fun since we had some time to kill. Going out on the ice was all fun and dandy, but while I was busy farting around my friend had wandered off towards the still liquid area of the lake surrounding where the stream enters the water. \n\nI yelled to be careful, etc, but he wasn't too bright and boom falls straight through the ice. \n\nSo now he's yelling for help, he's been fully submerged, but thankfully he was able to grab ahold of the edge and get his elbows up. He's freaking out for me to help him , but I knew that if I got to close I'd fall in too. \n\nThere weren't any big branches near by, but I grew up in AK so I was relatively experienced around ice (he was from Texas) so I laid flat and slid slowly out towards him. At first I tried to reach him with my hand, but I remember being worried about getting pulled in also so I then swung my empty backpack at him and he was able to grab ahold of it. I guess my body weight and his adrenaline were enough for him to pull himself out. \n\nWe then rushed back to my house to get him changed. \n\nI've been a lifeguard for many years, so I often have to save people, but this is by far the most real like (and untrained) life saving event that's ever occurred to me.\nTL;DR:"}

I like them all and will ride any type of roller coaster. No place on earth though has better roller coasters then Cedar Point. Every year, my church youth-group goes to Cedar Point. It is a fun time, and it is well worth it. My best friend is going for the first time, so we try to hit all the rides that we wanted him to ride.\nThe one ride that we wanted to do was Millennium Force. For those of you who have never been to Cedar Point or heard about this ride, it is considered to be one of the greatest roller coasters in the world, winning awards every year. So me and my three buddies hop in line. The first-timer friend is farther up in the line, and it is about a 1.5 hour wait. About 3/4th of the way through, a thought occured in my head.\nFor those of you who have never been on Millenium Force, your first time up is a bit freaky. Most of the time on your first ride, you usually black-out when you reach the top of the first hill (Actually, black-out is not really the way to describe, imagine the feeling you  get standing up too fast and multiply that by 100). So my first-timer friend will probably have that happen to him; it happened to me, my girlfriend, and my brother on their first time. So, right when we pass him in the line, I reach over and say;\n\"Hey, make sure you don't black-out on the top\".\nAfter that, I looked back, and saw everyone who heard me with a panic face on. When we pass my friend again in the line, he then informs me that he wants to get OUT of the line and sit down because he \"Was not feeling well to ride it\". So the poor bastard sat down and waited for his buddies to ride the coaster without him.\nTL;DR:"}

He was ill for pretty much the entirety of my life, 26 years in total if I recall correctly, and I was helping him/taking care of him for, well, my entire life. Recently he couldn't leave the house anymore, so I more or less knew what was going to happen sooner rather than later, but everything still took me by surprise.\n\nThe timing was absolutely awful, due to the fact that I've recently had surgery - and after I came back home from the hospital the very first thing I can fully recall is paramedics taking my dad to the hospital. He was mostly unconscious and was breathing via a ventilator until his death - so I couldn't talk to him on the phone, and visiting the hospital was out of the question due to me not being recovered at all.\n\nMy recovery also meant that I was unable to go to the funeral - which I've actually fought against, but my doctor told me that might be unwise this soon after surgery. I feel really fucking sad that I couldn't even say goodbye to him, even if it was after his death. The last thing he said to me was \"I love you, son. It's going to be alright\" before I went to the hospital for my surgery, which is not true because it's seriously not alright at the moment. I honestly don't know what to feel, and how to behave right now. \n\nI have even not told any of my friends... I'm sure they'd all say the same things and feel really bad, and I don't want to tell them, because I don't want to dump my problems on them, since they all have their own stuff they have to deal with.

My problem is, he doesn't even like taking cold medicine, he sees no problem with his emotions being all over the place and I cannot convince him to go to a doctor for health issues, much less his mental health issues.\n\nHe feels the need to \"fake\" wanting help because he sees nothing wrong and doesn't feel like he needs help.

I think she's moved on and I'm stuck.\nPOST: My ex-girlfriend and I had been dating for 3 years before this. We'd had a great relationship but over the last year I think we became complacent. I was going to school and she was busy at work. We didn't have much money or time and even though we were essentially living together at her place, we weren't investing in the relationship.\n\nI checked out to some extent and assumed that I would be able to do better. One night we had a discussion about the state of things and ended up breaking up. We lived together for 3 more weeks before she went to Europe for 2 months. \n\nAt first she seemed upset about things, but we didn't talk while she was gone. I ended up moving to a different city, but as soon as I did I felt immediate sadness, longing and regret. I still love her.\n\nI ended coming back to that city for a weekend and unfortunately while drinking I let her know that I wanted to get back together. She said no. I was distraught.\n\nNow to the worst part... I have the password for her facebook and I literally can't stop myself from logging in. I know it is so immature and childish, but I keep needing to know what is going on. She wasn't the best person before we dated (she cheated on her ex, and slept with a lot of people). When we dated she changed into this incredible person. Now, through her facebook I've discovered she has slept with a married guy who she works with, and now tonight invited another guy over. I feel betrayed because even after three years she has reverted to that person who she said she would never be.\n\nI feel terrible for invading her privacy but I just can't seem to move on. I've been working out every day, attending events with friends, meeting new people... but nobody seems to compare. She is coming to my city in a couple weeks and is attending two big drinking events with my friends... I am concerned about how I will react.\n\nI want her back so badly. I'm so hurt. I don't know how to move on... can anybody help?\nTL;DR:"}

Its just some of her habits are VERY unattractive to me.\n\nFor example, she'll paint her nails and literally wear it until it all comes off. She will have her nails patchy and flakey for like 2 weeks instead of scraping it off or redoing them. \n\nOr she'll go weeks without doing anything to her hair. I'm not the guy to care if she always has it styled or not, I just would like it to be neat (like in a ponytail or something). But she will literally run a brush over it like twice and call it a day (which just doesn't work very well for black women with natural hair).\n\nAnd the way she dresses when we go out in public can be embarrassing  One of the worst things ever seen her do is wear a hoodie with spots and the wrist all chewed up from her dog, some dress pants with a hole in the thigh, and some converse shoes covered in mud spots all at the same time. \n\nNow of course she doesn't do these things 100% of the time but it could be like 2 or 3 times a week, around our friends, peers, and colleagues. When you combine the nails thing, the hair thing, and the clothes thing it kind of makes me loose my attraction to her and can be embarrassing.\n\nI want to ask her to present herself nicer but without making her feel bad about herself or making myself look like an asshole.

We always sat together, asked how each others day went, etc. and we hit off pretty well when all of a sudden our friends noticed us together. They immediately went on to make things awkward as possible saying they ship us, why haven't I asked her already, etc. and eventually seemed to shut down the relationship entirely In a ridiculous climax when they were all chanting in the back for me to ask her. This obviously killed the conversation entirely and made things ridiculously awkward.\n\nSo then after that, she's been actively avoiding me. After weeks of sitting together and talking she all of a sudden stopped talking and actively avoids our usual seat. This has been tearing me up for the last few days because I really felt  we had a chance since she was dropping hints that she liked me too, and now we haven't talked in a week.\n\nSo my question is this, what should I do? Is she just embarrassed with our friend's reactions, or should I just give up, I don't know. Any and all advice would be great.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been working hard on improving my self-image as well as improving myself physically, but I still have pretty low self-esteem.\n\nLast night, I was watching *The Lord of the Rings* like a boss in the common area of a six person suite. One of my suitemates is friends with a girl who comes to our room often. She walked in last night and said hi to me and she probably thought I looked sad or something (I was watching LOTR by myself on a Friday night after all). Anyway, she came over and gave me a hug from behind as I was sitting in an armchair. To give you some context, I can count the number of times I've been hugged by a girl on 1 finger so it kind of meant a lot to me. \n\nAfter that, she went to her friends room and talked for a while. But around 30 minutes later, she came back out and wrapped her arms around me again without saying anything. It made me happy. Long story short, we snuggled for about 5 hours finishing *Fellowship of the Ring* and watching the entirety of *The Two Towers* (extended edition of course) until the sun came up. I know this kind of stuff is completely normal and unremarkable to most guys my age, but you know what? It meant a lot to me and made me a lot happier.

Neither of us is very experienced at dating. This is only my third relationship and the other two were relatively short lived. This is her first. Our relationship isn't very physical; we mostly stick to hugs, kisses, and the occasional making out. Its *nice*, but I'm not particularly excited about the lack of physical contact, but I understand her desire to take it slow with her first relationship and I'm willing to tolerate it for an indeterminate amount of time.\n\nIn closing, to the redditors that have more dating experience or who have been in a similar situation, is this a normal feeling?

Or should I not contact her until I'm in her town in a week and a half to see our mutual friends? I don't want to scare her away by telling her how much I like her and creep her out, but I also don't want to play it off and make her think I don't like her at all. What would Redit do?\nTL;DR:"}

I work long hours on weekdays: in by 7:30AM, home by 9:00PM or later. I come home, and there is crap everywhere. It builds and builds until the weekend comes.\n\nI can't relax in a messy house. Dishes (sometimes still with food) in sink, trash all over counters, toys everywhere, etc. I end up cleaning on the weekends because I can't stand it. I make the kids clean their crap (whining about how much it is), ask my wife to help (as she's playing Candy-effing-Crush or Face-effing-book) clean.\n\nWhy can't they just clean up their own crap? I spend time cleaning up a house that had literally NO messes made by me. I tried the don't-do-anything-until-they-do-it-themselves trick. That backfired miserably. I had TWO weeks of crap to do.\n\nCase in point: my wife stayed home today with the 15yo who is recovering from a tonsillectomy. I brought the 3yo and 4yo to a sitter.

Anyways, we were having a family reunion dinner at my cousins place. It was just a casual dinner and there wasn't a really big reason for it. However, the food was still expensive looking. There was stuff like lobster and venison, which is pretty hard to get here in New Zealand. Anyways, i was sitting on the long side of the table, facing the roast venison with my aunty sitting on the other side. I was trying to stay sober because i had some errands to do the next morning, so i decided to get myself a glass of pineapple juice while everybody else was getting drunk as fuck! \n\nNow this is where the fuck up happens. Everybody starts telling their drunk stories. It was my brothers turn to tell a story and the story he told cracked me up a little too hard. As he got to the funny part of the story, i was taking a massive gulp of my pineapple juice. I tried not to make the pineapple juice come out my nose so i decided to swallow it while i was laughing my ass off. That resulted in me choking and threw up a tsunami! It was like a car driving over a fire hydrant in GTA! Everything i had for dinner that night had sprayed across the table, all over the food and right into my aunty's face! My whole family just turned and looked and me and laughed! But my aunty wasn't impressed.. \n\nI now have a new nickname: WATERBLASTER.\nTL;DR:"}

As a child, I would often mediate arguments, it physically hurt me when my parents got into arguments, hearing about illness or injury always made me physically uncomfortable (as if I was experiencing it myself.) Because of this, I've gotten a reputation among my small circle of friends as the go-to person for all sorts of shit: advice, jokes, general pick-me-ups on a shitty day, and so on.\n\nI've also have a different side.\n\nIt's like there's a switch in my brain that flicks on, seemingly at random, which turns all empathy off. I become this misanthropic, cold-hearted bastard at the drop of a hat. As a kid this involved dissecting insects, or re-enacting the food chain in my backyard with myself as God and my dog as an apex predator. Now that I'm older, it involves a large amount of misanthropy, the belief that most of the human race consists of imbeciles and sheep who are just asking to be (pardon the pun) fleeced, a lot of time spent devising effecting and extremely painful torture methods and executions, and the idea that humanity as a whole is a disgusting cesspool of failure and stupidity.\n\nUntil recently, I thought this was completely normal. And then (surprise, surprise) after a deep conversation with a semi-trusted friend, I came to the realization that the whole deal is a lot less normal than I once thought.\nTL;DR:"}

I am from a fairly average background and she is from a super-rich family. This isn't the kind of rich where they have a big house and nice cars. I'm talking several mansions around the world, enough money for them to all live extremely comfortably for the rest of their lives kind of money. Hundreds of millions. She and her siblings have trust funds and basically will never need to worry about money ever in their lives.\n\nOver time as we've grown closer together and gone away with her family to their various worldly properties, the difference in our life situations has eaten away at me on the inside. I struggle for money and my girlfriend never has to worry about it. The control she has over her life and what she does with it feels a lot greater than mine.\n\nThis all being said, she is a wonderful human being, very kind and thoughtful and although she's a bit naive in some respects, she is very aware of the abundance she's been born into and has had a lot of problems past and present due to feelings of guilt. She works at the moment but there have been times in her life when she has been able to go off for a couple of years and travel and \"find herself\" and not work. Sometimes I find her idealogical views on the world hard to take seriously due to her being born into an ideological situation.\n\nCutting this short, I have often become passive aggressive towards her due to inherited wealth and it has hurt her a lot. I don't know if I'm feeling a mixture of resentment, inferiority, maybe jealousy and have not known how to deal with these feelings. The reality is that she IS rich and I'm not and maybe I need to suck it up and accept that. Some things will be easier or simpler for her than me.\n\nAnyone has any similar stories?\nTL;DR:"}

I was messing around, not thinking, and was swirling a half dollar in between my teeth. As unlucky as I was, it slipped in between my teeth, went down my throat, tried to cough it up, made it even worse, and completely swallowed the damned thing without a problem. I still wonder how I did not choke on it. Well I tell my parents that it was just a qauter to lessen tension on them and go along the week until friday hoping it would pass. My hopes were nothing but crushed as 5 days go by without passage. So on friday we go and get an xray and waddya know, its still stuck in my stomach. Two days go on and were still hoping for the best. Suddenly, my little brother gets a stomach virus and starts vomiting all over. Bad news, since its still in my stomach by then, or as I thought, if I threw up it might come up and I could choke in it. OF COURSE AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT I WAKE UP ONLY TO START PROJECTILE VOMITING ALL OVER THE DAMN BATHROOM. The quarter didn't come out, luckily, but we still needed to go to the ER to make sure I was safe. So today I spent a good 5 hours in the ER, got two x rays done to find out it passed into my colon. But because it is so big, Theres a chance it might not pass and I would have to get surgery, BUT, theres also the possibility that it could just rip right through my colon causing me the worst pain of my life and giving me a Colin bag for my shit if I live on the outside of my body forever. Of course, thats only a 1% chance, but its still there. JUST, WONDERFUL. I am praying to god I shit this thing out and be done with this burden.\nTL;DR:"}

He was very distant from me, and when he finally told me the truth he said he was just stressed because he got laid off from his job and needed some space.  \n\nOk, fine, space it is.  Things don't really improve, some days are better than others, but he tells me the same company that laid him off ended up offering him a different position with a raise.  Yet he was still distant from me.  I called him on it because the stress should be over now and he tells me the real truth: That he still really likes me but has been struggling with whether or not he's actually gay.  He said his friends have been telling him for the past couple weeks to tell me that he was struggling with this.  He also said that he wants me to be his friend, and that his friend group really likes me and it was nothing I did, but that he's not wanting to be in a relationship.\n\nFrom here, I wanted to make it clear that I liked him but would not be waiting around for him to make up his mind.  I have a life to live.  However, because of the chance that he will stop denying that he is gay due to stresses of work and family (which I believe is the truth) I'm having a hard time getting over him.  It's been a week and I really want to ask him or his friend if he was just being nice to me by saying he still liked me and was just confused about his sexuality, or if he's really just not interested.\n\nIs it always bad to ask for some closure?

Nothing wrong with that IMO, but in my case it has led to me not thinking about anything but \"eat, sleep, repeat\". My brain is kinda thinking that she will remind me anyway if there's something to do (Like an annual doctor's visit as I am used to by my parents when I was a child). Now, we've talked about this and I totally agree with her that I should be more \"self-sustaining\". **(1)** - would you agree with her or do you think she should scale down her \"being-a-mother-for-everyone\"? What does it mean for you to \"grow up\"? \n\nShe said that she'd also like if I told her these things, which is honestly hard for me since I'm not able to remember my own tasks...\n\nHere's another aspect of our two-year-relationship that is bothering me: Though I have my own apartment, we spend most of our time at her (parents') place. She argues that her fridge is full, because - well - 4 people eating 3 meals a day there. At my place? I got pasta, some bread and that's it.

Stupidly, I mildly posed him the question over text. I asked him if it was awkward for him to tell me he missed me or cared for me. He said no, that he was \"always like that\", and apologized. I had been stupid and I had stalked his facebook profile a few months ago, where I found him proclaiming how much he would miss his first ex when he went overseas, about how much he loved her, how great she was, etc. He has done no such thing for me, even to my face much less to strangers on Facebook.\n\nObviously, I never thought much of it at the time since but now I'm insecure. I don't know if he's telling the truth or if he just doesn't care about me as much as he cares about his ex. It's driving me crazy, since he hasn't told me he misses me even ONCE without me prompting it first. I know he does, but hearing it would make me feel so good.

He's truly a good boyfriend to me but this one thing is just making me feel so insecure right now.\n\nA little background: His first ex was the only girl he told he loved.

She is waiting until she has an income before she tells them.\n\nShe has met my entire family and has spent several weeks staying at my parents house, but she asked me to pretend we are not together and she asked my parents to not acknowledge that she stayed with them if we met her parents at graduation.\n\nI was upset by this and I avoided her at graduation because I didn't want to put myself or my family in a position where we have to lie to her parents too. My brother said he would \"spill the beans\" to her parents if he met them so I didn't want that either. Now we are in a big fight because we didn't get to spend graduation together and don't have any pictures together because I choose to keep my distance and left early. \n\nI feel like an asshole for how upset I made her, but at the same time I feel that pretending to be just a friend when I meet her parents, after 2 years of being together, would be very disingenuous. Eventually I want to tell her parents that we have been together for a few years, I don't want to deny the last two years of our relationship and pretend we are just starting to see each other. \n\nAm I being unreasonable? What would you do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My boyfriend [20 M] won't quit doing LSD and other similar substances dispite my [19 F] opinions. Does he love me?\nPOST: So, I've been seeing this guy for about 6 months now and I've honestly never felt so good in my entire life. I've had other relationships that I've been happy in, but none have ever even come close to how he makes me feel. He's someone I always envisioned myself with. \nThere's only one thing that causes a real strain in our relationship, but it's a big thing. (in my opinion anyways) I have a pretty firm opinion on the fact that I think drugs are not things to be used. I believe that there is a reason that some drugs are illegal and therefore shouldn't be done. He believes otherwise, and uses illegal substances. \nThey've helped him get through quite a few hard times in his life and he says they're a big part of his life. He says that he loves me and that I'm more important than those things, but that he can't shut out those opportunites and will continue to use them. I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but he knows how much trouble this has caused me. \nSo, does he really love me? Is there some part of his side of the story that I'm potentially missing? Are my opinions valid? Any advice would be greatly apppreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

He is guilt tripping my SO to watch his son, for free, overnight \"just a couple days a week\" while he's working. (He can only afford a babysitter 3 out of 5 days a week.) I feel like I can't say no because they're like brothers. I don't like that I won't be sleeping next to him for that amount of time or that he's being guilted. I feel like this is going to be a huge interference in our life and I don't want the stress of trying to conceive on top of it.\n\nI also feel like I'm being overemotional and dramatic though. I feel like my SO is \"the one\", we're going to get engaged soon and have been trying for a baby since November. However, I'm afraid that the worst case scenario, in addition to not being able to sleep next to him twice a week, is that his best friend living here (near us, not with us) will be a big interruption in our lives. I don't care if they hang out, but I feel like things are going to be excessive. \n\nI am being selfish, but at the same time I feel like I am entitled to that. If my SO had a child when I met him, I wouldn't have ever dated him. Despite how in love I am with him, if he turns out to have a large role in taking care of this child, I could see myself breaking up with him. I know when we have a child, a lot of the attention will be off me, and that's fine and expected. Great, even, because I want OUR child to be loved. (Hope this makes sense!)\n\nAm I being overemotional or \"smart\" about wanting to hold of on trying to conceive? If I decide to wait, how am I suppose to tell my SO about it without seeming like I'm sort of blackmailing him with it?\nTL;DR:"}

He hurt his pinky, my bike seemed to be ok in the dark but once I went to store it, it had a flat and the brake lever/ shifters were bent and the frame had some scratches also bar tape was ripped. Today I went to get a new tube and noticed there was more damage. He hasn't said anything about the damage to the bike. This past weekend his twin brother was mad at me for even letting him using it.

Dogs and humans lived together for about 30.000 years now.\n\nThis particular dog is a German Kleinspitz. We lived together for about 3 years now.\n\nThis is a well groomed and very much cared for animal. You must be able to differentiate this face from that of a dragon or whatever scares you and makes you run away, screaming. If you do scream, I'm going to assume this dog has also been loved more than you ever were or will be. If you do, I will also assume this dog has travelled more, seen more in life and is cleaner and healthier than you.\n\nThis dog, as well as any other dog that has been properly cared for and is not provoked, will not bite you. If you do provoke him, I'm sad to say it would probably take a few days of gnawing for him to do any damage to you, despite my wishes.\n\nThis dog, like the rest of his species, will not give you a disease by breathing the same air. He will certainly think your breath stinks, having a keen sense of smell, but he would understand, because he's a dog. What's also certain is that we're all more likely to catch a disease from your snotty kid wiping off ooze from their face on whatever surface around them.\n\nSo I will ride the bus with my dog. I will not like it, because there are stupid people, but I will do it because there's no escaping stupid people. The dog and I will also use the tube. We will not like it, because there are a lot of stupid people and less windows. I will not \"park my pooch\" in front of a store, for as long as you don't create a safe environment where you can leave your child on a leash. The dog would much rather play with that child or sniff air than choose the brand of cereal with me, anyways. I will also operate on a \"if my dog is not welcome, my money is not welcome either\" policy for all hospitality businesses.\n\nThe sooner you reach that higher evolutionary branch, the better for all of us.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been together for a long time now and really haven't had any relationship problems even now. I guess I just wanted some commentary/advice on how to nurture this.\n\nIt started the summer before my junior year and her freshman year. Long story short: we worked at the same place, a temporary summer job. I rigged a bunch of shifts to be with her after the first one (stalkerish, I know). Eventually I asked her out and she said yes. I know what a lot of people may think up until this point: 2 years older may be too much, it may not last, etc.\n\nFast forward about 3 years, here we are, with her about to enter her senior year and me about to go to my sophomore year of college. We live in the same city btw and I go to a college in the same city. \n\nIn the past year I became a little bit more needy than usual and I expressed this to her. She told me she understood how I felt and that she honestly was giving me all the time she coyld. She has an extraordinarily busy schedule. \n\nWe ended up resolving that problem because we agreed that our happiness was not contingent on the presence of the other at all times. We agreed that we would find ways to be happy even when the other wasn't around. This helped immensely. We're still going strong.\n\nNow, here comes stuff we've been talking about. \n\nPreface: we have gone no further than 3rd base and thus have never had sex. We talk about it a lot though. She has expressed repeatedly that she refuses to even consider it at least until she graduates.\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking here is....what now? Where should I go from here? How do I help nurture a relationship like this? Feel free to ask any questions. You won't offend me with any questions at all. The only advice I will ignore is to break up, because I see no need for it.\n\nThanks for reading!\nTL;DR:"}

I, as the middle child, and the middleman in most arguments, I can tell when the family is getting farther away from each other, my brother just got a job, sister is over friend's houses more and more, and my parents are stressed from the move to our new house. I know it may seem wierd having someone put personal stuff like this on, but I'm asking for help. I feel like a dog that we all share responsibility for might help bring everyone together, but there would be a few problems with getting a dog. As stated before, me and my brother are Scouts, so we'll be on camping trips, and the family take frequent trips to our beach house during the summer, the owner of which (my grandmother) doesn't like bringing dogs into the house, so that is a complication I may hope to work around (I'm her favorite grandchild). There will also be times when the whole family will leave on trips to visit family or friends, so and easily adaptable or (god forbid we can't take the dog for some reason) breed that can be alone for a short amount of time. One last thing is that I am allergic to dogs, so a breed that sheds a lot, if at all, would be a problem. I know that getting a dog is not the end all be all to solve a families problems, but it has worked in the past, when we lived in our old house.

Anyway i thought it was time to propose to her. Maybe this way she could realize that i want to live with her as a normal couple. So 3 months ago i asked her to marry me. Her reaction was a shock! She didnt expecting that. So i told her, ok take your time i know it is a big decision for you. 3 months now we are as always, i try to take an answer but she is still not sure.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [22/M] My girlfriend [22/F] is staying with her family for awhile and frequently vents to me about their dysfunction; feeling exhausted\nPOST: A little background: I've been with my girlfriend for about a year. We've both just finished undergrad, and in the short run she's staying with her family while I get ready to start graduate school in the fall (I must specify that as she saves money and looks for work she has little option at the time being other than to do so). Therefore, our relationship is currently long-distance. Aside from the typical stressors would might expect in a LDR (some separation anxiety, minor financial stressors regarding trip-planning, general adjustment), things have been going pretty well. However, recently I've been feeling frustrated and exhausted by some the make-up of our phone conversations.\n\nThere's a lot of dysfunction amongst her family members; I've experienced some of it first hand, some of it in the background of phone conversations, and some of it through stories and whatnot. There are some vast communication problems between them, a lot of names and swearing thrown around, lack of respect for privacy and property - it's really just a lot of negative energy. When she visits me or is occupied with other things, my girlfriend is a very fun-loving and happy person, but around her family she is frequently frustrated, grumpy, or angry. I want to support her and help her but lately a lot of our phone conversations consist of her venting to me about her family for long periods of time, and often times I witness their fights with each other over the phone. It's becoming emotionally exhausting for me, and lately I feel like I've been shutting down or withdrawing when it happens. In turn, she gets frustrated because she doesn't feel she has my support either. How do I help her feel more positive and relaxed in that environment while also communicating to her that the frequency of her in-family fighting is adding a lot of tension and negative energy to our relationship and is seriously exhausting me? I really care about her, and I know she can't control how her family acts, but right now this aspect of our relationship is very stressful for me at a time when I'm already feeling anxious about starting grad school.\nTL;DR:"}

Now we never made anything official, but we got along great and I thought we were moving towards that point.\n  \nNow about a week ago, she started getting really distant and I could tell something was up. We went most of the week not talking, but we ended up getting lunch earlier today where essentially she said \"I like you, but I'm not looking for a relationship right now because I'm not a relationship person.\" I said that I wasn't sure what I wanted out of this and my plan was just to have fun and see where it went, to which she replied that she really couldn't see it going any further.\n\nI really don't mean to make anything more out of this than was there, but it sucks because I really *do* like this girl, and I'm not sure that I want to give up on trying to get her. But that said, I don't know that I can just be friends with her as that wouldn't be fair to her (because I would have an ulterior motive)\n\nSo my questions are this. 1) Should I do anything more to try to make something happen here, or should I just let it go and move on? 2) And this one is weird, but assuming I don't pursue this any further do I ask her specifically why things didn't work out? That's really blunt and awkward, but it might be interesting to know for the future with someone else.\nTL;DR:"}

Green is used solely to connect her to people so she can get pot  and she uses me for medical advice for her pets (I work in the vet medical field I'm not just a random choice). \n\nWe've all noticed it and we all also know she bitches about all of us to each of us when the others aren't around, Blue avoids bringing it up because she rather keep peace in the house and green just takes it because she's like that, I on the other hand am sick of it and don't know how to handle this when I know I can't really avoid her. I also recently learnt that the \"my way or the highway\" vibe she gives off is true, if you confront her about something she doesn't like she becomes verbally and physically abusive, I've walked in to her throwing shit at Blue because they got in an argument. \n\nSo basically besides letting this all blow up and her treating this like a 13 year old (because she will) how would I deal with her while still essentially having to \"live with her\" being around.\nTL;DR:"}

We set up a chain outside for her that reaches into our garage, where her food, water, and kennel are. It's not very warm, as the floor is just dirt and mot cemented and it's not a heated garage. My mom's garage door is also jammed open, so closing it up isn't much of an option. \n\nWhen I moved to the Twin Cities for college late summer 2011 (I was only gone 10 months; on really cold winter nights mom would bring her inside and stick her in my old room), mom quit bringing her in at night and she lost her kennel training, so she whimpers almost all night and frankly doesn't like being inside longer than 5 hours period now. She stays outside now but I do take her for long walks once to twice a day, depending on my schedule. \n\nAnyway, when I try covering her kennel (her pet carrier that's two sizes too big on purpose and outfitted with a fluffy comfy pillow) with a blanket, she yanks it off and tears it apart.

Both our ex's were the ones to have an affair.\nAbout every 2 - 3 weeks, we are fighting, and like most couples we have intimate knowledge of the other persons faults, and insecurities. When we fight, we tend to throw them at the other person. Example, Her father is very strict, and cold emotionally and has the opinion that my wife is overly emotional, or My ex wife was a stripper in her late teens, and had long since abandoned that lifestyle before our daughter was born. When we fight, we use these things to hurt the other person.\nThe fights always seem (to me) to start out of nothing, I lack empathy, or respect for other's emotions, I think people should just \"get over it\" if they were offended by someones words. I don't know why I am that way, and after I have hurt that person, and I have time to reflect I always feel horrible for invalidating that persons emotions. My wife has a temper that results to her yelling and screaming, throwing things and hitting objects.

I dont need religion to be a good person. Human decency regulates my life. I do everything I can to be a good and decent person because I want to. \n\nI like the idea of an afterlife, but I have no idea what that might mean. It was this fact that made my friend say I'm agnostic. But I've always thought the main notion of agnosticism is \"we can't know\".

I couldn't bring myself to go back and see the animal or even confirm it was dead. And then I looked at the front of my car to see what kind of damage it had done. There was a fairly large (two balled fists together) dent in the front panel under the light. Then I just got in and went home. I got my food and went inside and just sat here for a few moments. I felt seriously bad, I didn't know what I could possibly do. I want back outside to look at the damage again, noticed an even larger dent on my right front panel behind the front wheel. It is actually a large dent! That is a bummer big time considering I drive a really nice car and I am only 23 and paid for it. but I felt bad for the pup and bad for the owners.

It is going so well, nice pay bump, increadible benefits (free lunch/breakfast, etc) so lots of money savings. The biggest benefit that I love is that they give me a Ventra Card (in Chicago). It is a public transportation card that allows me to freely use all public transportation in the city for free all the time.  \n\nWith that being said, I never use my car anymore, and my car insurance is pretty high at $122/mo. I am with State Farm, and I tried to switch to Geico, but sad to say, I'm not the best driver out there. I have gotten into two (very minor) accidents in the past 2 years, and both were my fault. (At least I'm not on the road anymore, right?!). Geico gave me a higher quote after a full check at $130/mo. I declined for now. I use my car, probably around 1 time a month, if that, for a quick ride for an errand or something. I was wondering if there was any tricks or tips to try to get that rate of 122/mo lowered since I am NEVER going to use the car?\n\n23/yr old Male, 2 accidents on record. Chicago, IL.\n\nThank you so much in advance for any tips!!\nTL;DR:"}

I have liked her for months, so when we started dating I couldn't be happier! We are open with each other and have already had sex. I just want to point out I am really happy with her.\n\nMy problem is with what she has done with her ex's. To be honest, it is nothing too crazy, and I had asked her about it so this is my fault. She told me what she has done and it is bothering me. She did not even know me when she did this stuff, but I think I have a mixture of jealousy from just thinking about her with other guys and wanting to do some of the stuff she has done. She has already said she wants to do that stuff with me and she is open to doing more with me so I really shouldn't be upset. I would just appreciate any input from someone who has been in my situation. I want to state that I am not mad at her at all. If I am mad at anyone, it is at myself. I feel childish having these feelings, but I cannot figure out how to just let it go.\nTL;DR:"}

I was getting comfortable with it and decided to try some heavy smoke tricks (you can see where this is going) and eventually the smoke rose right above me, right into the smoke detector. All of a sudden it starts beeping and the girl looks at me and tells me to get into her closet. I sprint to her closet, barely fit, and wait as I hear people screaming and shouting to get out of the dorms and how this wasn't a drill.\n\nFour minutes pass of me waiting in the closet listening to the alarm scream at me for my gigantic fuck up. The girl texts me saying that I need to get out ASAP and how the fire department is on its way and that they'll be searching rooms for the fire. I flip the fuck out and sprint across the room after turning off the light and struggle in the dark to open her window (thankfully it was on the ground floor) but I couldn't get it open for the life of me. I hear sirens and adrenaline shoots through my body. I can see the lights flashing off of the walls and now I go into fight or flight mode and jerk the window as hard as I can, it opens and I jump out. \n\nNow comes the hard part. I had to evade people and escape the college. I channel my inner Skyrim character and go into full blown stealth mode. I sneak along a brick wall and peak around it, it lead to the parking lot where my car was. Just to make my luck even worse, the campus security car was parked right next to mine. I now play the waiting game and sneak to my car as the officer makes his way to the college. I casually walk up to my car, hop in, and drive home to post this. \n\nWhat makes it even worse is that they traced the alarm to her room and she had to make some kind of crazy excuse to get the President and her RA off her back.\nTL;DR:"}

For instance, I was hanging out with some friends and one of them happened to mention that this girl and I are now exclusive, to which another friend responded \"oh so is she your girlfriend now?\" I hesitated for a second because I realized that I wouldn't want to go around calling her my girlfriend if she wasn't ready for that, but I also didn't want to give the impression to my friends that I'm unsure of my feelings about her. I ended up reiterating that we were exclusive and said that we hadn't talked about labels though, to which my friend responded \"oh I didn't know there was a difference.\"\n\nSo what of it? Should I talk to this girl about calling each other girlfriend/boyfriend? If so how should I do it? Is it perhaps still too soon?\n \nAnother thing that may be worth mentioning is that about a week before we became exclusive, she told me about how when she was waiting for the subway one day, some random guy kept harassing her telling her \"you need a boyfriend.\" Might have been just something that happened, or maybe it was a hint?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [25M] nurse neighbor's [30-ishF] dogs bark incessantly when she's not home.\nPOST: I moved with my dog to a new city for a job and quickly found an apartment. Since then I've found that the apartment immediately below me belongs to a woman who I believe is a nurse (scrubs) and she owns two jack russell dogs, one possibly a puppy. Because she's a nurse she works long hours, often leaving at about 5am and getting home typically between 8-9pm I believe. \n\nThe problem: these dogs are the **loudest**, most **obnoxious** little buggers I've ever heard. My walls are already paper thin. They wake me up the moment they begin barking at 5am and I have to listen to them all day unless I'm not home for some reason. These dogs sit in the window and bark when they hear a pin drop, see a car, see a person, or lord have mercy they see another dog and flip their shit. I cannot explain how irritating it is when I need to make a conference call and I have to either hover over the mute button so that I can press it when they begin barking, or banish myself to a small room and risk sounding like I'm calling from the toilet. \n\nAfter speaking with another neighbor while walking my own dog she told me that this nurse woman made a comment to her that \"my babies always bark when they see my car pull up.\" She either doesn't give a damn or honestly thinks her precious babies only bark when they see her vehicle.\n\nI'm about at my wits end at this point. In my lease agreement it states under a heading title \"Nuisance\" that \"Tenant(s) or any of his family, guests and visitors shall not disturb or annoy the neighbors by any unseemly or untimely noise or by any improper interference in any way.\" Is this grounds for me to make a formal complaint? I've tried to keep an eye out for her when she comes home, but she either comes home after I go to sleep and then leaves before I wake up or she comes home and leaves immediately for who-knows-where.\nTL;DR:"}

During that time, she had a one night stand with a friend of mine, at a party I was at, and hooked up with her ex (at a different school) multiple times. We talked before the spring semester ended and she decided to try again with her ex. We started dating about two months later. At the time when she hooked up with them we were just friends with benefits, but talked often and weren't just around for drunk sex.\n\nThe trouble is that I am having a hard time getting over that and the fact that she chose her ex first , and for that night, my friend over me. I just am having a difficult time both explaining this to her, and believing that at some point she won't choose someone over me again.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: When do I [22F] tell someone I'm dating that I have health problems?\nPOST: So, for the past few years, I've had difficulty with my health. Eventually, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Long story short for people who are unfamiliar, I deal with chronic pain and chronic fatigue on a daily basis. I currently live with my parents because I am unable to work full time in any job I could get right now (retail, food service, etc.) because it's too difficult to be on my feet/physically active for that long. I took some time off school when it got really bad but now that I'm on medication, I'm finishing up my degree and will be applying to grad school. I hope that an advanced degree will let me get a job where I can sit a lot and use my brain rather than my body so much. So, I have plans and hopes to be become independent soon but right now, that's not the case.\n\nI've dated and had relationships before I got sick (3-4 years ago) but it's been a lot to deal with so I haven't really had the time or energy to date much since I got sick. A few dates here and there but nothing came of them so I didn't really think about it. Now, I've started seeing someone [M24]. It's not in relationship territory yet but we've been on a few dates and I like him. \n\nSo...when do I tell him about my health? Things are better now than they have been since I got sick but I'll never be \"well\" again and it could get worse. I don't want to waste his time or make him feel like he was tricked into being with me. I can have fun and it's not as huge of a disability as some other conditions but I'm not naive. This condition isn't going anywhere and can be a burden. I feel guilty all the time for all my parents still do for me at my age. But they signed up for this by having a child. A partner doesn't have to and I want to give him a chance to get out before anything between us gets serious. That said, I don't want to spoil the fun we are having now or make him think that I don't want to keep seeing him. So how long do I wait to disclose?\nTL;DR:"}

In January \u00a0I will have known my \"boyfriend\" [27m] for a year meaning we started talking online around then. It's been a rocky road which is why I put boyfriend in quotes because i am still confused after all this time about where he stands. We have amazing chemistry and have a lot of fun when we're together.\n\u00a0I have always been the one to push for some sort of exclusivity or label on the relationship mostly for peace of mind. We went through a period of not speaking for a few months because of that and then a few months ago we started talking because he missed me ( his words were \" it felt like something was missing\"). he's a tough one because he likes his space and doesn't like to talk about feelings often. I finally got him to delete his profile and say we were exclusive but he still seems to have issues saying hes my boyfriend. I am not trying to get married or move in because everything is still new and even though I have a son I am not trying to rush into anything crazy but I want to know he's committed to me because I care about him so much and I don't do casual. We don't get to spend as much time together as I'd like because I have my son and work during the week and Saturday is really my only day to myself.\u00a0\n\nSO my main issue here is trying to figure out if he really does care and will want to move in the direction of getting serious or if he doesn't think I'm \"the one\". I have never met any of his friends or family and I get the feeling that he doesn't let anyone in his life know I exist like I'm some kind of secret. \u00a0He also has issues saying I'm his gf and always makes it a joke.\u00a0\nI just can never really tell how he feels because I can't get a straight answer out of him. He tells me he cares about me and he still liked me when I was heavier around when we first met (lost almost 60 lbs yayyy) \u00a0am I overreacting? I don't want to push him away but I need to know if he's serious\nTL;DR:"}

We have a wonderful relationship and are true equal partners. We split everything right down the middle: paying, bills, housework, etc. However, with an engagement on the horizon, we are struggling a little bit with traditions, especially concerning me taking his last name. This isn't a heated battle by any means, but I feel like we have truly hit a snag and would love to know either other options or everyone's advice. \n\nI grew up a very independent only child. My dad was a very big reason for this. He would always say, \"If you get married, you should keep your last name. You should be proud to be a [insert last name].\" I feel very connected to my last name. I'm a teacher, so it is used a lot, and I just in general feel like it is a big part of my identity. \n\nMy boyfriend on the other hand is the only male in his family who will be carrying on his last name, so I believe he feels that pressure. No so much from his family, but he likes the tradition of it. He says that since there are traditions that I want to follow, a proposal with an engagement ring, that I should follow traditions that are important to him as well. \n\nI told him that I would hyphenate my last name if he did as well. But that is a no go for him. \n\nWhat do you think Reddit? Is there a compromise to this situation that we are missing? Am I or he being unreasonable?\nTL;DR:"}

We talked for a bit, kissed, and agreed to meet at another party the next week. There, I tried to pick up where we left off, but she just went completely cold on me. I don't know what happened, but I asked her out and she said no. Fine.\n\nAnyway, we go to a lot of the same places, and over the last year we've become pretty good friends. Problem is, I've developed some strong feelings for her. When we're together I'm absolutely fine, but when I'm at home or at work I can't stop thinking about her. The obvious way to deal with it is to cut off contact, but that means not only would I have to stop going to some of my favourite places, but more importantly it means giving up a friend. I need to find a way to suppress my emotions, because I'm getting to the point where the only way I can stop thinking about her is to drink until I pass out.\n\nWe're fairly close, and she does tell me about some personal things, but she's never talked about what happened between us, and I won't push her for an explanation. We're both single and have been for a while. There's also the fact that she looks a LOT like my ex-fiancee - probably why I was attracted to her in the first place. That whole thing ended abruptly, so I probably have some unresolved feelings there. I'm a bit of a mess, really.\n\nJust to stress, I'm not hanging around in the hope that she's going to suddenly going to ask me out; that ship has sailed, and I need to find a way to deal with it.\n\nI don't think just going out and dating someone else is the answer either. If I did that, I'd just be pushing all of my problems on to them and using them as a distraction, rather than dealing with my issues.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Hey LoseIt, what's the worst that could happen?\nPOST: So last winter I went through a pretty severe depression which caused me to lose my appetite almost altogether. Food made me nauseated, and often the crying caused me to have dry heaves anyway, only when I did eat, they weren't dry.\n\nIf I had been at a normal weight then, people would have been really worried about me. But at that point in my life, by standard definitions, I was morbidly obese.  But that episode caused me to lose a lot of weight.  And admittedly I got a lot of positive attention. And for the first time in my life I began to care about my appearance.  \n\nComing out of that depression I learned two things: first, I can survive comfortably on a lot less food than I initially thought, and second, losing weight doesn't have to be difficult, just disciplined.\n\nEarly in the summer of that year, I started light cardio and weight training.  My weight had plateaued as I got some of my appetite back, but I was still not at a healthy weight.\n\nFast forward to today: My BMI is in the normal range, my height to weight ratio is .45, but that stubborn belly fat is still hanging in there. I still work out, but not as regularly as I should. But on reduced caloric intake alone I'm steadily shedding about 3 lbs a week and hope to continue to do so for another 6 or 7.\n\nBased on my stellar math skills, I've derived that to maintain this pattern I can consume about 700 calories a day, allowing about 400-500 extra for each time I exercise.\n\nSo I turn to you, LoseIt, not to tell me that working out is a more efficient method of weight loss, because I am simply not motivated to exercise more than I do.  However, feel free to scare the hell out of me with the horrible things that starvation can do to my body.\nTL;DR:"}

These dinners are basically events which every employee is required to attend.

HR completely drops the ball and serves water with some lemon squeezed into it and a dish containing tomato.  Two bites of food and one big swallow of water later, she's forced to dash out of the event and get to a hospital before she asphyxiates.\n\nShe returns to work the next day without so much as an apology.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: What's your coolest family-history story?\nPOST: I'll try and be brief.\n\nSo my great-grandfather came over from Italy in 1932. He got jobs digging graves and shoveling coal into a furnace for some green houses at a farm. Meanwhile, he started his own construction crew and began sending work visas back to his town in Italy. Two cool parts. The first, when the graveyard he worked at filled up, they had to move. That meant moving all of the graves and getting new headstones. Well, the graveyard had to get rid of the stones, so my great-grandfather offered to take them off their hands for free (quarries charge for that kind of stuff). At the same time, the farmers that owned the green houses were selling their land off for residential use. He bought a plot at a cheap rate thanks to their friendship and used the free headstones to build a house. It's the same house my dad grew up in, with the unmarked side of headstones lining the front wall. Second, the work visas that my great-grandfather sent back are responsible for five other families being in America. Coincidentally, all those families stayed in the same area, and ended up with descendants in my high school graduating class. 80 years after my great-grandfather came to America, five other families have kids in college thanks to his hard work.\nTL;DR:"}

So me, being paranoid, as always, am trying to not make eye contact and just go through the store getting what I need. The reason I go to this store is because it has really good deals...

So a line of my stuff comes down and I just mindlessly put it into my bag. I go into a packing zone out in which I put everything in front of me in a bag. There is a small pause of food. This is where shit hits the fan. I am still in bag packing zone and some more food comes down the lane, I shuffle it into my bag without noticing it isn't even mine. I am face-palming just typing this. So after 2 or 3 items, some lady realizes a hooligan is trying to steal her peanut butter cookies and her small cake.

So after an extremely awkward 5 seconds of this stare down, my brain comes to the realization of the situation. I quickly grab the food that I now remember isn't mine and put it on the conveyor belt and quickly power walk my way out of the store...\nTL;DR:"}

When wronged, if it was out of mal intent or if the person didn't show remorse, I always sought reparation or justice to remedy whatever damages I incurred at the fault of another's selfishness or negligence. I found it as a way to forgive and move on. A way to feel less humiliated because I had striked back and hopefully deterred the perpetrator from continuing his/her actions in the future. It was a way to feel relief, a way to let go and move on. And a way to let the universe know that it should not try that again on me. \n\nI constantly read articles and proverbs and poems about how the best revenge is success. That it's best to let go and move on. But couldn't this arguably, be the very reason for why people continue to do things like this? Because they expect the victim to shrug and move on? Because it's almost like it's expected and accepted? At what point should people take control and demand reparation for lost time from deceit, even if in the form of justice?

I'm really excited! We're eloping in Maui, Hawaii and our only guests are my future brother-in-law and his partner.\n\nThis is where things get a bit stressy.\n\nMy best friend was supposed to be my maid of honour but we had a huge fall out, despite being friends for 10 years. She started lying to me about money, expecting me to go out and spend all of my time planning her things for the wedding instead of anything to do with me and my fiance. I've had to plan everything on my own, which was difficult because we're getting married in Hawaii but live in Scotland. I could have used the help but all she was worried about was her dress and when she was going to be getting married (she's not engaged yet).\n\nIt was really stressful but eventually, her lies about money etc. got too much and I had enough. Long story short, we don't speak any more and she isn't invited to the wedding.\n\nFast forward to the present day and she and her partner are also here in Hawaii. They put down a stupid deposit for their trip which they couldn't get back after she was uninvited, so couldn't cancel. They're out here making a huge fuss of what a great time they're having on social media, which is a problem because no one knows we're getting married. She knows this. But she's doing it anyway. I'm really freaked because I'm worried she's going to blow the whole thing. It's not very common for people from Scotland to come out to Hawaii, so I'm worried our mutual friends are going to figure out why they're here too.\n\nMaybe I'm daft to be worrying so much but I really needed to vent. I've been stressed for days and just want to enjoy our day. The whole reason we decided to elope was to avoid all stress and have it all about each other, I wanted to avoid this crap...\nTL;DR:"}

Been talking about marriage, kids, etc. since about 4 months in. Things were more than amazing until about 4 months ago.\n\nShe started to have really bad mood swings and would just break down over little things. I thought it was just because she hated her job, had some family problems, things like that. But about a week ago I walk downstairs and see her crying and she tells me she doesn't want to do this anymore and that is what has been causing her to be so depressed because she feels guilty because none of us did anything bad or fought she just doesn't feel any passion from me. \n\nNow I'm not a generally romantic person, I'm very logical and rational, and to me a night at home in PJ's is the same as a night out on the town. I don't care what we are doing as long as we are together. However, about 2 months ago we had a long talk about her wanting me to show more passion, which I did, in droves. I was doing everything I could but I guess I just did too much damage and she doesn't believe me now when I tell her how much she means to me. \n\nI'm terrible with words (as I'm sure you can tell) and didn't ever know how to express my feelings until I was unfortunately forced to. But me pouring out my heart is only pushing her farther away, which I just don't understand. \n\nShe is literally my entire world, and I know that most people would say this when being broken up with, but I don't care about anything else. I've known from day 1 she was the one for me but now shes gone. I'm a complete wreck without her and on top of all that I'm 900 miles away for this entire week due to work so I can't even see her. \n\nSo I guess if anyone has advice, or just anything to say that would make the feeling of me wanting to vomit so hard my heart explodes I'd appreciate it.\n\nThanks...\nTL;DR:"}

I'm about to turn 16, 5'8'' 118lbs and I had never taken part in any real physical activity before I started running track at my school in November. For the first three weeks I burst into tears as soon as I got in the car I even had a huge breakdown in front of everyone while we were running hills. My mother; although she had not forced me to start forced me to stay... I noticed some improvement in the sense that I no longer keeled over (literally) after two laps around the track. I only ran the 55 in one meet and I got some awful time along the lines of 10 seconds. That was just the indoor season. \n\nI thought outdoor was going to be the same and that I could handle it but I'm slowly coming to realize I really can't. I'm just awful in general. I ran the 200 last week and I got a 36.02. I hate the feeling of being last... very very last. Maybe sprinting just isn't my thing? I don't foresee myself getting better at all and I am a very weak person mentally as well as physically. \n\nI dread going to school everyday because of practice afterwards. My grades have suffered because I come home drained and mad at myself. I might have to start doing my homework during lunch or something...\n\nPart of the reason I haven't quit yet is my coach. He is an Olympic athlete, professional photographer, and amazing person. I hate to quit on him as well as all of the amazing people on the team. Most of them are beautiful (also part of the reason I am still there) straight A students. I just don't see how they do it. I want so badly to do well. I want to be amazing. I just don't think I have what it takes. I don't know if I can handle all this embarrassment and I don't see how this is going to help me in the future because I don't think I'll want to run in college (nor do I think I will be good enough). I make jewelry on the weekends and sell it on my Etsy, I love Doctor Who, video games, etc. I'm very different from most of the people on the team in general. I wish I could be like them.\nTL;DR:"}

My plan was to establish residency so I could receive in state tuition. One requirement is a job, which I can't seem to find anywhere. I never worked throughout high school so I have no experience which makes it so hard to get a job.\n\nNext, I was suppose to be signing a lease for a place to live off campus for this summer and next year. It would be myself and 3 other people. 2 girls, 1 guy. Today I find out that the 2 girls decided to sign a lease without informing me. This leaves me shit out of luck seeing as I can't afford a two bedroom apartment.\n\nI didn't want to attend school in my home state because I always had dreams of traveling and going away, but I'm so close to saying \"fuck it\" and going home for school next year. All of this and school is stressing me out more than I can handle. Not to mention my parents are in Jamaica with no way of contacting them. I would feel like a failure having to go back home and admit that I couldn't manage living there. This feeling sucks.

Bitched about everything he did, threw tantrums, destroyed his stuff, etc. She was basically a piece of shit to him, his friends, and his family until he finally kicked her out. Ended up finding out she faked breast cancer to financially take advantage of him the short time they were together. Now, a good friend of mine lost her life to cancer a couple years ago. It's a sensitive subject, so faking cancer? Dick move. I also knew this woman, as we all lived in a smallish town, and she's always been a complete and utter asshole to me since the day she met I moved here.\n\nWe moved in together during their break up. (just as friends at the time. We used to work together).\n\nBitchlady says she can't move all her stuff down to her new apartment and she needs to store it at our place for a week. Okay. Fine. The next week she calls *me* and says \"I have no truck to move my things. My ex needs to use his truck to do it. He should anyway since he left me without giving me any notice in advance.\"  I pass the message on and he decides to do it if only to get her out of his hair sooner.\n\nIn the time that we're living together, I learn that crazy lady *hates* the smell of vanilla. It literally makes her vomit. I take a couple of bottles of vanilla scented oil and a bottle of vanilla body spray and make sure to really rub a shitload of it/spray it into all her wood furniture (it was dry as hell, so it really soaked in), and any other possessions she had stored at our place. Her stuff **reeked** of vanilla. You could smell vanilla from a few feet away. We go to drop everything off later that day. We unloaded all her shit in the driveway. The two of us get back in the truck after everything is unloaded and, as we're about to drive away, we see her walk out to her stuff, then promptly walk away from it gagging and nearly throwing up in her driveway.\nTL;DR:"}

We broke up once or twice before but always got back together. \nThe issue the whole relationship was always that he never had a stable job. Always quitting or getting fired. The first couple years it didn't bother me because I was going to school and it didn't matter. But when I started working in my career, I found a job about an hour away and had to move. We would switch off once a week driving to see each other and then he started going to school. \nHe really puts 100% into his school work, which I always supported. But i really wanted him to work while in school. It started to feel like I was supporting him since he was staying in my place during summer and not really helping out much while I was at work. He would pitch in a little and clean but most days he'd sit around on the computer all day. Really only thinking and caring about himself. \nI just couldn't do it anymore.

I had a few interviews where I made it to the final cut but I was cited for \"lack of experience.\" This kind of upsets me because I feel like my experience in Australia had me doing so many more experienced things that someone else in my position would not have had the opportunity to do so. It is displayed that way on my CV but I feel like I might not be getting the point across.\n\nSo in conclusions my questions are 1) How to make my Australia experience set me apart from others? 2) Is it worth looking for work outside of sports, at least either temp to keep up a cash flow or permanent to get non-sports on my resume? 3) If I do leave the sports industry, will future employers look down upon it even though I do have credible sports experience?\nTL;DR:"}

After their last fight before the breakup, I told them both that I would not be supporting their relationship any longer.\n\nNow that things are over between them, it appears she has gone no contact.

I told him the truth (the ex and I have talked about half a dozen times, once about their relationship in particular and how shitty breakups can be), which I am starting to regret.

They started asking everybody in the panel questions, and when they got to me this is how the conversation went:\n\nLawyer: \"Mr. chazoh, we see that you brought a book with you today. Can you tell us about that book you brought in and why you brought it?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, I brought this book called 'The Male Sexuality' because I'm just really interested in sex. I love sex. I'd like to learn a lot more about sex. I just love sex.\"\n\nTurns out, the case was about a sex offender who was accused once again of sexual assault. They ended up letting me and another guy who had been sexually abused in the past off the jury.\n\nI got paid a bonus that week from my boss after I told him how I got out of jury duty for the rest of the week.\nTL;DR:"}

I was looking for roommates in the area on Craigslist and attached a resume to give the other person a general sense about who I am (I know it sounds weird, but I find that it is at least informative). I also explained that, due to the low pay of my first job I would be looking for part-time work on weekends to repay loans.\n\nWell, one person whom I sent a resume to said that, while they already found a tenant, I would be perfect for a part-time bookkeeping job that their father's security firm was trying to fill. I interviewed with him and got the job.\n\nThis definitely isn't an advisable strategy since A) it's craigslist and B) if everyone did this it would be a disaster. But it is interesting that after months of looking for a job and not understanding how you can artificially create networking opportunities, I sort of found a way. A more careful person (though assumedly desperate enough to do this) would obviously redact their phone number and only include their email address.\nTL;DR:"}

I could never ask for more. She is smart, cute, very very funny, has a beautiful personality, and is just all out perfect in my eyes. \n\nAlthough in my opinion, she is the most perfect woman ever, she also has very rough insecuries, in which I try to help her with as much as I can. We talk all day every single day about literally everything, and we are very close and know very much about who we are as people.  \n\nI have been with her through quite a bit of hard times, and generally I do a good job at helping her through all of those dark times in her life. However, whenever she talks about her insecurities, she tells me I won't be able to help her, or that nothing that I can say will change her mind about how she views herself, and I don't know what to do.. \nI just want her to be happy 100%. I Understand that getting over insecurities take time, and a lot of effort, but I want to help her not dwell on them, or at least help her take her mind off of them. \n\nHas anyone had any very bad insecurities? If so, what do you/did you do to take your mind off of them? Or even help another insecure person out? \n\nThank you very much in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

Any advice is welcomed!\nPOST: Hi /r/loseit, I have somehow found myself the sole active moderator over at /r/XboxFitness , and I need some advice in crafting a routine for what has swelled to over 150 people! (When I started it was like 30 people, now that the membership is large... I want to get it right).\n\nThe single most requested feature was a \"schedule\" (I had simply been posting my workouts for others to follow or not). So I started planning my weeks videos out...\n\n**What is Xbox Fitness?**\n\nXbox Fitness is an app on xbox that \"Game-ifies\" various exercise DVDs with the Kinect camera, giving users points for reps, holding their form, etc. etc.\n\n**What the community has done**\n\nIn January we started a \"January with Jillian Michaels\" program. We started with \"Ripped in 30\" on MWF and \"Extreme Shed and Shred\" on TuTh(Sa). Some people even added Kickboxing to MWF to get an hour's worth of fitness in. These tapes (ooh, dating myself), are all cross training. That is, they all have some weight training, cardio, and bodyweight fitness, and some abs.\n\n**The Problem with February**\n\nThis is where Im seeking advice. The members of /r/XboxFitness have expressed interest in using the MOSSA selections for February. MOSSA divides cardio from weightlifting from abs into 3 separate 30 min routines. The MOSSA selections are\n\n* Core 1 30min\n\n* Core 2 30min\n\n* Fight 1 30min\n\n* Fight 2 30min\n\n* Groove 1 30min\n\n* Power 1 30min\n\n* Power 2 30min\n\nWould there be a significant advantage to dividing the days by type (ie MWF = 2x fight videos for an hour of cardio & TuThSa 2x Power videos for an hour of lifting)? Or for this kind of exercise, would it be better to mix a power and fight video each day? How often would you recommend the 30 min abs? Would it be better to have shorter power or cardio when adding an abs video?\nTL;DR:"}

Things are going really well, and although nothing is \"official\", it is starting to get pretty serious and never in the course of our relationship have either of us seen other people. He recently purchased his first home, and made several comments about how great this is for us. We don't currently live together but I have a feeling it is headed in that direction. \n\nSomething we often talk about is the future, we are both comfortable in careers and self sufficient. We both seem eager to start that next chapter in life, and something we both want is a family.\n\nHere's my dilemma... About two years ago towards the end of my previous relationship, there was an accidental pregnancy. Even though it was unexpected, I was thrilled. My ex did not feel the same way. I blame the stress of all the fighting, but only two weeks after finding out, I had a miscarriage. I hadn't even announced the pregnancy to anyone, so at the time I just decided it was best to keep the whole ordeal to myself. I felt guilty. I still do. And I've never told anyone about it, only my ex and my doctor know. \n\nSo my question is, if the guy I'm seeing now turns out to be 'the one' is my miscarriage something I should disclose to him? If so, when? \n\nIf anyone has been through this or something similar, I'd really appreciate some guidance. I mean if we do plan on starting a family together, I think it's only fair he should know but I have no idea how to approach it, or if it is even necessary to.\nTL;DR:"}

There's many more examples, but that's the general summary.\n\nBut to the point. How am I supposed to leave this place without tearing apart the family?

Somehow it came out that he initially proposed because he felt pressured. He did it to make me happy.

I felt scared because I have been in a serious relationship where we shared everything, and then had a long, divorce-like split. \n\nAfter my SO and I living together for a year I wanted to know his intentions were eventually marriage. I did not want to build a life together only to find out he didn't want to marry me. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I want to be a wife. I did not give him an ultimatum where he had to marry me right then or else I'm gone. \n\nBack to now, I'm heartbroken. The night he proposed was beautiful. He's an amazing man.

Now the mom is pretty irresponsible and honestly it kind of annoys me that she's taking advantage of my girlfriend's offer to help and dumping most of the planning work on her while she's out shopping, but that's an entirely different argument.\n\nBasically this mom is one of those parents who allows her daughter to drink and basically have alcohol at her party.

I'm definitely not comfortable with the prospect of\u00a0my girlfriend getting extremely drunk at a party without me there. And to make matters worse, her friends best friend is some guy who has somewhat hit on my girlfriend in the past, and honestly makes me a bit uncomfortable, and my girlfriend was very understanding of this, and despite disagreeing that he has a thing for her, she agreed to mostly cut him out of her life, though I told her she didn't have to. While that was resolved, and I don't believe my girlfriend to be untrustworthy, it doesn't exactly make me feel any better about this situation.\n\nShould I be comfortable with the prospect of my girlfriend possibly getting very drunk at a party without me, and staying there? She's very lovi g and has never shown me any reason not to trust her, but I guess all the stories on r/relationships and horror stories of alcohol fueled cheating, have kind of jaded me, and I've never had a girlfriend go out and get drunk without me being there, so I'm a bit uncomfortable with the situation.\nTL;DR:"}

Lately she's been going out with her girlfriends a lot.  And I am okay with that, and I trust her and all.  When she goes out she usually tells me when a guy hits on her at the bar.  I'm okay with that too.  She's attractive and I would be more concerned if she wasn't occasionally hit on.  \n\nWhat I'm mainly concerned about is her lack of interest in calling and texting me lately.  She seems not to care.  Then today she tells me she's going to lunch with a friend.  I ask who and she says it's one of her girlfriends.  Then later I get a text saying that her girlfriend couldn't make it so she is going to lunch with guyfriend.  Well I ask who is that because I never heard his name before.  She says it's just a friend.  He goes to local university.  I wonder how she met this random guy.  \n\nThis is when I say distance is getting to me and I can't wait to be done with school (which I will be next month).

Nothing so terrible that it outright proved cheating, but messages like \"I still love you, I'm sorry for the way things ended, I think about you a lot\" (to the ex) and messages that were highly flirtatious and lacked mentioning of being in a committed relationship to various \"friends\". Previously he had told me these women were hitting on him, contacting him, etc. and now I know this isn't true.\n\nI'm really not too distressed as they all were BEFORE we got married, but I feel a bit angry.

I'm mingling and avoiding the alcohol with a cup full of orange fanta. I seem to be doing pretty well; talking to this group of guys and generally being awesome when this girl walks up to me and says \"You're that creepy faggot who rides who ride's around on a bike.\" Not mad at all; just making conversation. I said something to the effect of \"yeah, that's me.\" and blew her off, but I was really offend and kinda hurt. anyway didn't ruin the night. It just kinda threw me off.\nTL;DR:"}

He is dominant and has quite a character, but is a sweet guy. He shows no fear for anything and anyone, is really well adjusted, he is the playful and intelligent, high energy type of pup. Never been in a cage and has no terrible traumatizing past, just born on the streets and lived in temporarly homes till i met him.\n\nAt home he is golden and does everything he is told, outside he is ok and he listens as long as there are no strong distractions. \n\nWhen it comes to other dogs it's an issue. At the dog park he is often challenging toward other males (he never attacks first, but he approaches them with a hostile stance, sometime even growls).\n\nThat leads to brawls and he has already been bitten, even in a pretty serious manner, but nothing changed in his behavior. He is not better, nor worse (not more aggressive or scared. just the same).\n\nOn the street he always makes a big deal about other dogs, pulling the leash, barking and putting on the full show till i drag him away.\n\nI tried the jolly routine most trainers talk about, but when my dog is excited he refuses food (even the delicious kind, yes), toys (squeaky ones too), everything. And he's not distracted or interested by silly voices, water on his face, stomping, clapping hands.\nTL;DR:"}

Help?\nPOST: I've been dating this guy for 5 months and we spend practically every moment together. A few weeks back he wanted to goto a dub step concert with a friend of his who he has told me numerous times surrounds himself with strippers and X. Apparently this guy makes a habit out of feeding strippers X till they can't walk. My bf told me he would probably partake in the drug (no issue with the drug btw). My issue was the person he was going with and the fact that when my bf gets on X he's EXTREMELY emotional and touchy feely. I told him I didn't feel comfortable with him going and it turned into a drop down fight. Eventually he relented and didn't go. The bf says he doesn't support his friends lifestyle yet for some reason is getting involved with it.\n\nA few weeks later a friend invited me to his shows after party. My bf brought up the dub step concert and used it as a reason why he didn't want me going so without a fight I said fine and didn't. Now tonight he texts me and tells me not to bother getting him from work cause he's going to a different dub step concert with this same friend and that I shouldn't expect to see him tonight. I don't want him to go for obvious reasons and do not trust his friend. I also don't trust him going to a rave on on X surrounded by strippers. I don't know if I can or should say anything or just let it go. I guess my biggest worry is that he's going to cheat. He has given me NO indication he's the type but I just have this weird gut feeling. Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

We had our own room, but I wanted that feel of independence in my own space. Out of frustration, I moved out with a long time girl friend, and had been living there for about month before things got kind of hard, and more frustrating. I wasn't seeing him, due to different work schedules, and it really sucked. We didn't talk much either, and when we did, it was very short and not something I was used to as I was living with him and constantly seeing him. I went on vacation and tried to forget about it, but the second day I got back I ended it, thinking there was no point. Well, we've been apart for a few months, and we've remain fairly close, still quite obvious we both have feelings for each other, and I've realized I made a really dumb mistake by leaving him over something that could be fixed with more effort on my side. I've tried talking to him about how I want to take it back and try to make it work again and he wants to, but is very hesitant and doesn't want to jump back in it. I feel like it's a trust issue, that he might be scared it wouldn't work again, but he's the type of person I really enjoy being with, and am extremely comfortable around. I don't know what I could do to make him trust me more/learn to let me back in. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

Never once when we were hanging out did I ever get a bad impression from her.  She always wanted to be near me, hold hands etc. Up untill 3 days ago she seemed very into me.

I didnt think much of it untill a couple days later I realized that she wasn't really into texting as much anymore.  I would send her the same enthusiatic texts and she gave very vague boring responses, nothing I could respond to.

I can only conclude that I got married for the wrong reasons before and this time I am in love and want to commit myself and my life to my partner. \n\nLately, whenever anyone has happy news I find myself resentful and envious. We have friends getting married next week and I'm trying anything I can to back out because the thought of going to someone's wedding is just awful. I've never been like this before. I'm usually happy for other people and their accomplishments. I've always loved going to weddings.\n\nI'm not going to break up with my boyfriend. I do not want this to be a deal breaker for me. I love him and we have a great happy family together. We actively work on ourselves and our relationship and generally have great communication. I have talked to him about this but he's at a loss as well. How can I get over this?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [20M, 19F] My relationship with my girlfriend of three years is falling apart, what the fuck should I do?\nPOST: Backstory: I've been dating this girl since high school, we had a somewhat rough relationship early on because she was dealing with deadbeat parents, a bad breakup from her last ex-boyfriend, and general trust issues I guess. I put a ton of effort into our relationship and was constantly supportive and whatnot, and we basically worked around some of her issues to the point where we were both very happy together. We ended up going to college together and things began to deteriorate, I guess.\n\nNow, I fit a lot of the 'typical redditor' tropes- I had a pretty cushy upbringing and as a result didn't become particularly independent, I'm smart but very passive and generally unmotivated, and have minor anxiety issues. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is fiercely independent and far more mature than I am. To put things bluntly, she adjusted far better to college than I did. I've struggled to make decent grades, make friends, and just take advantage of opportunities while she's out running for student council. And our relationship has really suffered- she's been feeling like she's \"obligated\" to do things with me, she's not happy at all, and she recently said she needs some time and space to think things over. If I don't turn things around soon, she is going to break things off and we both know it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to do anymore. Being in a high school relationship was easy, dealing with parents and gossip and stupid teenager drama, but I just haven't handled the transition to an adult relationship well at all. In the beginning I put in 90% of the effort to make it work, but that's totally flipped now and I just haven't been able to hold up my end of the responsibilities. Basically, she's been feeling like she has to almost take care of me, and that's the last thing I want. Don't get me wrong- I don't think I'm entitled to anything just because I was a great boyfriend to her in high school, I just want to get back to even stevens. I love this girl with all of my heart and want to be able to make her happy again.\nTL;DR:"}

It started as FWB a little over three months ago, and about two months ago we had a discussion deciding that we shouldn't be boyfriend and girlfriend. However, as time has gone by he's met some of my family more than once and I'm slowly but surely integrating into his group of friends that I've met solely through him. I stay the night at his house roughly 3-5 times per week and we will generally hang out until 2-4pm the next day assuming we both have it off work/school. \n\nI really want a label on the relationship but he won't commit. I know he's not seeing other people because we've talked about our exclusivity and decided together that before one of us hooks up with another person we absolutely have to tell the other person first in addition to the fact that when we don't stay together we generally talk/text the majority of the night. \n\nHe says he doesn't want a label because he doesn't want things to change between us and because he sees his younger brother becoming more and more committed to his girlfriend and doesn't want to be like that. He also is going through a rough patch in his life and doesn't want to burden me, but I don't mind a little crazy here and there in my life and I've told him that.\n\nI don't want to put an ultimatum on our relationship and we already are basically dating. I'm pretty sure we both have an emotional thing in our situation but I feel like I want the relationship more than he does. I don't know if that's the case however, since the last few times I've stayed over we didn't even have sex but still swapped a quick kiss goodbye. \n\nSo, I guess what I want advice on is whether or not to stay in this situation and I'm also wondering what people make of the whole dating-but-not-dating thing, because I have no idea what to make of it.\nTL;DR:"}

The thoughts have died down only a little bit, I no longer think about him getting hit by a car on the way to work every  morning, or getting really hurt by the big machinery at work everyday. But every few days or so, mostly when I'm lying in bed alone, the random, unwanted thought of what would happen if he did die hits me. Sometimes I can push them off, especially if I'm with him, or distracted, out in public. If it happens when I'm alone, I don't have the same ability.\n\nWe've been together over a year now and in fact, tomorrow will be the first anniversary of my moving in with him.(Just realized that now, wow.)  It doesn't help he has health issues as is, he was a very sick baby and had multiple issues. He still has heart problems and even liver problems, cancer runs rampant in his family. I can't help being worried it means he's going to have a short life. On top of this, this is actually my first proper relationship, let alone one so serious that we discuss marriage venues and whether or not we're having kids. We live together. I don't think I'd ever be able to fully cope if he died and left me all alone. It breaks my heart when we're walking together and the random thought of a car coming too fast around a corner and taking him out, or some other stupid shit like that.\n\nI know it's unfounded, and certainly something I shouldn't stress on, but I'm reminded everyday that unfortunate things happen to people who weren't expecting it. Young lives and love ruined by tragedy. I don't want to be apart of that.\n\nI can't stop anything like that happening, it's not within my power, so I shouldn't bother stressing.

We had a huge fight and we mutually broke up out of impulse/anger.  A few days after the fight/break up, I find out that he reactivated his okcupid account that he created when we were on a break/long distance.  I feel disgusted and hurt and sad and a billion other things. \n\nHow long do most people wait after a breakup until they start trying to hit people up on okcupid and online dating?  I can't even fathom flirting with other guys right now.  I'm going through a hard time with the breakup, and seeing his okcupid account looking for \"bisexual girls\" and \"cougars\" makes me sick to my stomach and question wtf the past 3 years meant and if I was even his type in the first place (I am neither bisexual nor over 40) =/\n\nThanks for letting me vent and any insight into guys' thought processes after a breakup would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

We have barely spoken in that time, in fact the first time we spoke since the breakup was a few months ago for about 5 min, second time we talked was a few weeks ago again for only a few mins. \n\nThe other night I was out with friends, I noticed him staring at me a few times during the night, just before he left he came up to me, repeatedly told me I looked fantastic, hugged me, kissed me on the head a few times and was being generally clingy.\n\nI'm really confused by this. And tomorrow I am seeing him at a BBQ (as we both have the same mutual friends). I am also really awkward and don't know what to do about seeing him, because I know I won't be able to avoid being awkward around him...its a trait that's engrained into me.\n\nI just need advice on how to handle the situation - do I ignore him, avoid him, confront him, try and act normal or like nothing happened? I have no feelings for him anymore and am currently dating a fantastic guy (he doesn't know about him) but he has seen me with other guys since our breakup.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: Potential jobs vs. Job offer\nPOST: I am a recent college graduate and need some advice on my job hunt. I have been applying for jobs for about 4-5 months now and wasn't having any luck. Recently I was asked to interview for a company that wouldn't have been my first choice, but since I wasn't getting called back about other applications I went ahead and scheduled the interview. After that I was offered 3 other interviews at different companies. Two of these Jobs I would much prefer. Now this is where it gets tricky. I figured that it would take the first company a while to make a decision after the interview because of the reviews I have read on glass door, However they came back with a job offer the next day. They have given me 3 days to make a decision, and I still have interviews over the next couple of weeks at my preferred companies. The job I have been offered is salaried with good benefits however my preferred position will pay much better have similar benefits and offers bonuses. So I am wondering if It would be better to take the offered position or decline it in hopes that I do well at my next few interviews and get the job I really want?\n\nIf you want more detail about the positions I can give more info, but I am trying to leave the company names out.\nTL;DR:"}

Well, I met this girl through 2 mutual friend in my physics class and so we started talking and wad obvious she liked me and I liked her. But I was waiting to ask her out because I wanted to make sure. We went on 'dates' to places alone but not official and when she rested her head my shoulder was the happiest I've been in a long time. This was the first girl to ever make me feel actually happy. \n\nSo a few weeks pass and I finally decide screw it I'll ask her out what's the worst that could happen? Well when I finally decide to ask her out, she tells me asked rather just be friends. When I asked her the reason she said it wad because I waited too long. She wants to be friends but whenever I see her everyday in physics I can't help but think of everything and how much I really like her. It tears me up thinking about what could've been.\n\nMy friends say that if waiting too long is the sole reason for not wanting to go out with me, then I wouldn't wanted to date her anyway. I'm not sure if I believe that though.\n\nIs there any way to maybe salvage a relationship? If not, how do I deal with this? This is my first relationship so it stings pretty bad.\nTL;DR:"}

Our personalities mesh up super well and we're into very similar things. \n\nThe only thing is, our sexual tendencies don't necessarily match up the best. He's into some things that I'm really not. I'm pretty vanilla when it comes to the bedroom and my libido is pretty low due to some medicine I have to take for my anxiety (but I'm hoping to get that fixed...) We've always had a few fights about it (my lack of sexting, his constant horniness, etc) but recently, the fighting has gotten pretty bad. Maybe it's the sex stuff that's finally breaking us down, or maybe it's just a breakdown of our communication since neither of us have really done this before. I don't think it's anybody's fault more so than anyone else, but it's like everything's started to break down. It got to the point where this past week, he told me he wanted to take a break to think about if we should really still be a couple or if we could think of how to help all of our issues. He says he still loves me and cares for me a lot, but he just doesn't know if our relationship is healthy anymore and if we should keep going. \n\nPart of me agrees that yeah, we've got a lot of issues and maybe it would be good to explore our options. We're young, we've only been with each other, maybe we don't know what we really want? But the other part of me is paralyzed. I can't imagine a week without him, much less forever. I really want to be with him, but I don't know what to do. Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

I've always had low self esteem. When I was a kid, I thought that anyone who wore sunglasses were the bees knees therefore I wanted to be like them. Following suit, if I ever was going to meet someone new or see someone I had not seen in awhile, I wore sunglasses. Even in circumstances where sunglasses were obsolete, I wore them. I remember a time when I went to visit my grandparents in Florida, we arrived late at night and I wore my sunglasses to greet them. My grandma called me out, however, but I didn't care (she was an old lady; what did she know). To this day, I love wearing sunglasses and I still think I look pretty sweet in them. I have a pair of Oakley Antix black-on-black sunglasses that fit me perfectly and I wear them whenever I can (circumstances permitting; I don't wear them at night anymore). I have a few other minor things but wearing sunglasses in the dark as a kid stands out compared to the others.\nTL;DR:"}

I am the default parent, and the default adult in our relationship. For the first  year of our eldests life I did basically everything. Every nappy, every feeding (EBF), every outfit change, everything. Recently he has finally started changing a few nappies here and there and helping in small ways but its not heaps, and he often seems to resent doing it. \n\nHe gets grumpy very easily while solo parenting, and while he has never taken it out on anyone physically, it doesn't leave him a very nice person to be around while he's in a mood. I basically don't feel comfortable with the idea of him having custody away from me at this stage because of how he acts when I see him or hear  of him talk of his times solo parenting. I am only just feeling comfortable with the idea of my eldest having overnights away from me now,  and worry about how soon they would press for him to be able to take belly bub, who I also plan to EBF.\n\nI also don't want to kick him out, because the only place he has to easily go is unsuitable for children and is very far from his work. However I don't feel like it would be fair for my son and I to pack everything up and try and move in with my parents who have less space.\n\nI am financially dependent on him but I know our welfare system will be able to help me if I can get past the stand down weeks after a potential split - I think it takes about a month from what I've heard, but I am hopeful my parents  would be able to help. Splitting our stuff would be uncomfortable, but ultimately doable. It's really just the idea of the initial transition and not having full custody of my children that scares me, even though I wouldn't want to be one of those  mums that keeps kids from their Dad's.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Did I give up too quickly on my ex?\nPOST: 27/m, three months ago I broke up with my 24/f girlfriend of a few years.  The relationship had simply run its course for me and would not have survived going any farther.  She took this amazingly well at the time, I moved out, and we went our separate ways as strong friends.\n\nJust days after breaking up, she confirms that she's on the proverbial prowl.  This isn't entirely surprising given how her past relationships ended (including the one before ours), so I voice my concerns over this not only for her well-being (rebound relationships are bad for anyone), but my own feelings being hurt too.  It felt disrespectful to our recent past to deal with her feelings that way.  This doesn't go over well and after many similar conversations, I decided I could no longer be in contact with her if she was going to be doing that.  She tells me how I'm \"quitting her\" like everyone else does (she never said anything this bad during our relationship) and, I assume, has either found someone already or is well on her way.\n\nI've come to peace with the fact that I won't change her mind and her mistakes are her own no matter how much I want to help.  But I suppose my question is whether or not cutting all ties until some point in the future is unreasonable on my part.  I'm sure keeping constant contact would have made emotions linger longer than they have this way, but I feel like the friendship will be defunct because of this.  I wish I could be there in some supportive way no matter what, especially since she seems to have never felt that from anyone before, but my feelings got in the way of that.  I'm trying to move on as best I can, but unsure feelings keep cropping up.\nTL;DR:"}

I think I came off as more into this girl than I am, I just thought it was a curious behavior and wondered what people's thoughts were. Anyway, thanks for the advice. The point to take away, I think, is not to overanalyze something as insignificant as a like on instagram. Especially when you take bitchin' pictures like I do (even my archenemies like my photos!). Also, to those who are hounding for never meeting her in real life, my texts were about meeting up. ya know, so we weren't just internet strangers. So maybe she wasn't a fan of that idea.\n\nI met a girl on OKC, and we messaged a few times and ended up following each other on Instagram and exchanging numbers. We had some a little friendly texting back and forth, 15-20 texts over a couple days but the last couple texts I've sent had no response. \n\nSpecifically, I ended a conversation with one text, and then a week or so later texted her with no response, and then a few days later tried again with no response, so I stopped texting her (I figured that was a hint).\n\nThe weird thing to me is that she continues liking my Instagram posts. Like, not just a couple times, but relatively consistently. Is this a hint that I should try again, or is she just a social media superconsumer and I'm misjudging the situation?\n\nShe mentioned she lives in my neighborhood (and it's not a huge neighborhood), so even without trying it is very likely that we will cross paths at some point. I think it's actually best if I just keep posting great Instagram content, ignore it, and if we do ever run into each other in person, just laugh it off.\nTL;DR:"}

It's not exactly my style of music, but I'm always down to check something out.\n\nWhile watching I was trying to see what the conductor was really doing.  I think the idea is that they are leading the musicians and keeping them all together.  But what I couldn't help but think is that they'd be fine without him as well.  The musicians are of course all amazing at their instruments, and were looking at their sheet music 99% of the time.\n\nFinally, the last piece had a singer come out, and the conductor was behind her, so she was taking literally zero queue from him, which furthered my idea that, for these professional musicians, they could do without the guy up front with the little wand.\n\nYet the conductor always gets top billing, and their names are always quite well known (at least in those circles), leading me to question my questioning.\nTL;DR:"}

I've seen the documents first-hand and can confirm that there's no deception going on. Last night she confirmed that she is ~2 weeks pregnant with three different tests. The odds are astronomically against what happened, she tried for several years with a former partner to conceive and never could, even with an IVF. \n\nI don't know what to do. We're both strongly pro-choice but she seems very inclined to keep it. She's told me that I'm free to leave if I don't want to be involved and that she'd care for it independently. I was raised without a father because of a guy who made that choice and I'm not sure I can walk away. I'm also not sure though that this is someone I want to be with my entire life, or if we would have a stable and healthy relationship for the child. So far it's been great and we've said I love you to one another (and meant it) but no matter how intense things have been I wouldn't have expected this decisions at six weeks.\n\nFinancially it's feasible as we both make good money but I wouldn't have done it for at least a few years if I had the choice. Frankly I feel emotionally drawn towards \"doing the right thing\" and supporting her unconditionally but rationally I feel like an abortion would be the best choice. If she doesn't see it that way, though, I will be stuck choosing between making a lifelong commitment to raising a child with a woman I've only dated for less than 1 season of Game of Thrones or walking out on a pregnant woman that I do genuinely care deeply for and living life knowing I have a child somewhere in the world. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, I've been on the verge of puking since yesterday.\nTL;DR:"}

Why/why not?\nPOST: Now before dog owners everywhere go all Bob Barker on me with their \"Spay & Neuter!!!\" Please read. I've grown up with dogs all my life, however growing up I was only responsible for feedings, walking, playing etc. My parents were the ones who took care of all the vet visits. This is my first dog as an adult, I found her as a stray and planned to find her owners or re-home her, after owners couldn't be found I fell in love and decided to keep her. She is a 9 lbs. I believe Morkie (Maltese/Yorkie) Mix. In all honesty if she was larger I would probably have her spayed as my dogs growing up were all large breed spayed dogs. However because of her small size I worry about an unnecessary surgery. She's an indoor dog for the most part, when I'm gone for a weekend she stays with a friend who has a male lab but is usually kept in her kennel and at the dog park when anyone so much as sniffs her she sits down like she doesn't want any part of that. I know there are other benefits to spaying such as behavioral problems (which she doesn't have) and preventative measures for cancer or something like that but I'm just not sure the rewards out weigh the risks of having such a small indoor dog spayed. Also, I ask because a local organization is offering free spay/neuter and I'm on the fence about taking her. I've never made such a decision on behalf of another living being and am terribly worried if something went wrong in an unnecessary surgery I would never forgive myself. Also I consider myself a responsible dog owner, she's up to date on all her necessary vaccinations, aside from bordetella which I opted not to give her and gets flea/heart worm medication monthly.\nTL;DR:"}

Totally relaxed, grooming, you know.. chill. And Opal (dog) walks through the living room, also relaxed and chill. This should never turn into an issue right? Well as soon as Opal passes by that chair, Ozzie reaches out and claws the skin on her back, pulls it up, and then bites it! It looked like he was biting into a hamburger! Just totally out of the blue. They do this stuff all. the. time.     \nI've never really seen it as too much of an issue, just weird horseplay. Opal didn't seem to mind too much but recently, she's been very concerned if the cats approach her. Sometimes she'll even growl at them. (this is very recent- the cats started it!) Now if opal was a little shihtzu or something I wouldn't been too worried because it would be an even match. But she's a 60 lb pit mix and if she decides to defend herself against their attacks, she could do some serious damage. So how do I get my cats to stop being terrorists?\nTL;DR:"}

And I don't have feelings for him, but I am interested to some extent, so I'm wondering whether I can successfully hook up with him and reign in any possibly resulting feelings, and if maybe that's what I should go for, or whether I can aim for more - and if I can, whether a hookup would be a step backwards, or the place to start.\n\nAlso, for the guys: If you had a shot with a girl you were once interested in, would the fact that she once dated one of your friends be a deal-breaker? IOW, to what extent does the bro-code rule apply, and how strictly do you guys adhere to it? In my particular circumstance, a friend of mine strongly believes bro-code wouldn't/shouldn't be a deterrent to this guy, but I can't think like a guy, so I'm asking you instead.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My girlfriend [23 F] and I [23 M] are from radically different socioeconomic backgrounds and I think it's a problem for me\nPOST: I grew up pretty poor and my family remains solidly working class. Her family is wealthy and mixes with influential people. We've been together for 18 months and it's mostly been really good. We've been fighting more lately and I think more than I would like to admit of that stems from money-related issues. \n\nThe main problem is that I think I struggle to empathise with her sometimes because I am aware that she has more privilege than probably anyone I have ever met. I sometimes feel like she has had a super easy life and I am sometimes bothered by her lack of struggles in her life and with her self. \n\nShe is fairly unspoilt. She likes to eat out at nicer places than I do and is obviously more used to doing \"nice\" things like that than I am. We live in (and share the rent of) a nicer, more expensive place than I would on my own. I sometimes feel like she could pay for more things (we tend to try to pay 50/50, without counting every dollar) because we are in different financial situations. \n\nWe don't see her family much because of where we are living, but when we do they are very generous and I must admit that I enjoy the benefits of their wealth. Yet I feel myself resenting my girlfriend for growing up like this. \n\nI know that most of the issues around money are my own. I know that she didn't choose to grow up in her family any more than anyone else does, and she could certainly act far more 'spoilt' than she does. The fact that she's with me alone is testament to her not caring so much about money/social status. \n\nTyping all of this out really makes me think I should just shut up and get over it. There are obviously worse problems to have in a relationship. But it keeps coming up for me and I think it stops me from being as loving and empathetic as I could be when she's feeling bad. \n\nIs anyone else in a similar position (on either side of the equation)? Even if you are not, I'd appreciate any thoughts. \n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [FL] Insurance Offer Question\nPOST: Hello there Reddit, \n\nI was just hoping to get some opinions on the issue I'm currently dealing with.  A few weeks ago my father was killed while riding his bicycle by a kid in a stolen car. While getting all the post death issues taken care of, we wondered if there would be any liability on the part of the person who had their car stolen. We were told that usually a car being stolen absolves them of any issues, so we didn't think of it again. \n\nCome to last week and my mother is contacted by the insurance of the owner of the stolen car. Turns out the owner of the car left the key in the car, and the car running which is how the kid stole it and this creates a high amount of liability (We read this on the police report he filed for his stolen car). They tell her they feel bad, have talked to corporate, etc and that they want to offer her 100k as it's the most they can pay out. She'll need to sign a document saying if she accepts the money it clears the policy holders of any further liability down the road. \n\nMy mother considered it a blessing and is happy, but it had me wondering. I decided to ask some law friends who told me it is highly unusual for the Insurance company to offer such a high settlement off the bat, they usually low ball. So my question is, why would they offer so much? I was hoping someone out there may have had some experience with this and could shed some light on the situation. \n\nI've already talked to a lawyer in my area and will be setting up an appointment but I just want to make sure there is even a reason to. It's certainly a possibility the insurance is telling the truth, and is indeed being caring and compassionate and just cut away the red tape and offered the max right away. \n\nAny advice, or experience would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Am I over-reacting?\nPOST: I am all for self defense and all, but I do not tolerate those who hit unprovoked. And I am a pacifist, so I have never hit anybody in my entire life. \n\nWell yesterday night, I came to pick my boyfriend up from work because his car was still being serviced during that time and most of his friends were either asleep or at work themselves. But something work-related for me came up, and I was only able to come get him an hour later than I said I could. He seemed really annoyed when I told him over the phone, but he didn't complain.\n\nAnyway, when he got in the car, he was smiling at me. But not the happy kind of smiling, but the passive-aggressive kind of smile that people make when they're pissed or agitated. And once he got seated and buckled up, he hit my arm REALLY hard. And it wasn't even the type of hitting that was playful or uninentionally painful, because he didn't do it once---- he did it multiple times, LOUDLY. Perhaps it was more like a very hard spank on the arm, but it hurt regardless. It made my arm red and the pain lasted 10-20 minutes each. He really MEANT for it to hurt. \n\nBut when I kept telling him that it was painful, he only laughed and told me that it was okay since he's never hit me before. \n\nSo since then I haven't really felt like talking to him and he seems to be acting pretty normal, as if he'd done nothing wrong. Am I feeling bad about this over nothing, or could this become a problem in the long run?\n\n...\nTL;DR:"}

He turns 27 this month. We get along very well, have a lot of the same interests, same political beliefs, values etc. I go to a liberal arts college, it is very prestigious and very difficult. Early on in the relationship he has explained multiple times that he fully intends to support me and come second to my education. He wants me to do well. He is busy himself, he is a sales manager at a very successful car lot and has his own friends and family. \n\nHe treats me respectfully, takes me out on dates (we like to go out to eat, go kart racing, going for runs, playing video games together) and wants me to feel comfortable. He knows he likes me more than I do at this point, and has allowed the relationship to progress at my pace. His only character flaw I've observed is that he is prone to letting people take advantage of him and use/ abuse him because he feels committed to making other peoples lives better even when the relationship is toxic. \n\nI'm leaving for china in a month for four months on a study abroad and he is so excited for me. He can't wait for me to go! Has been researching it and everything. I figure if he sticks around for that four months, I may consider being his girlfriend officially. The only problem is, he would be my first boyfriend, and my family is very particular about me in general. My mother is very religious, and expects me to be with someone equally as religious. He is not. He did not finish college because he had preferred to work at the time which he regrets but he is very intelligent. My parents won't appreciate that either. As shallow as it sounds, he may not be attractive enough for my mothers standards. (which I dont care about but I know shell give me hell for it).

We have a very healthy relationship with only minor arguments here and there that every couple deals with.\n\nHowever, there is one flaw of mine that is causing me a large amount of distress and I want nothing more than to be rid of it.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have both dated others before our current relationship, she's dated one guy and I've dated 3 or 4 gals. The difference is, I was a virgin when we started dating, and she was not. We're sexually active now and it makes me feel even closer to her. However, I've been severely struggling with the fact that she has slept with someone else before me. I think my feelings are amplified by the fact that the guy took advantage of her and only used her for sex since he cheated on her during their entire relationship.\n\nNow I know she didn't know that she would ever be with me and I know it's SO unfair for me to feel this way. I want nothing more than to accept her for who she is and what she's done and I HAVE accepted her but I can't stop these thoughts that keep racking my conscious and I just want them to end. I love her no matter what and that won't ever change.\n\nShe's already broken down crying to me that she feels really guilty and she wishes that I had taken her virginity instead and I did the right thing and told her the right thing, that it wasn't her fault, that I don't blame her for anything, that I love her and that some arbitrary societal concept doesn't change my feelings for her or make her a corrupted person.

Some of you guys also helped, I was reading a lot here. But I need specific advice on my current problem and I didn't find anything that could help so here we go:\n\nSo, I met this girl online some time ago (about 2 years) and i commented on her pics on a social network. That was actually it.. Then last September I saw that she commented on a status of a (obviously) mutual friend on facebook. I then just wrote 'Hey <name> blahblah' and added her. We're both really addicted to games and we started playing a lot together. First just over the ingame voice, then skype. Then we skyped almost daily for moths. We basically had contact every day. Me, being stupid, fell for her. So I asked her out some time (she lives rather close). She said she needed to lose some weight etc before we meet. I saw pics of her, she doesn't. Well, me, being even more stupid, kept asking her. And now I realize that it must've been fucking creepy.\nWell, it came the way it had to come and she stopped talking for me. After confronting her and asking what's going on she said that we're going too far and we're beyond friendship, but she didn't want it. Me, being stupid one more time, only saw the \"we're beyond friendship\" part and ignored her intention. And ever since we've skype 2 or 3 times and she said that when we talk she gets in a bad mood and everything.. although I actually don't understand that.. we were having fun in skype.\nAnyway, I needed some time and I'm actually thankful, because she forced me to be without her and in that time i just realized that it won't work. So I guess I'm starting to stop loving her (yeah, sounds strange, but you understand.). But I really don't want to lose her as a friend, she's the most awesome person I've ever met and I wish that it's like in the beginning.\n\nWhat do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

We are so happy and we work so well, I have never felt this happy, stable, etc. in a relationship before in my life.\n\nThere is one problem: His ex. They broke up after four years about three years ago, but they still talk. This girl is also in a committed relationship, but is the type where there's never really a closed door. I am worried that her little \"check-in's\" are a way of keeping tabs. There is also a fling he keeps in contact with who has clearly expressed her dislike for me and is very obvious about it.\n\nNow, let me preface this before you ask: We are fine. I am not worried about him cheating, and I never have been. We are totally honest with one another, and we communicate very well. My background with relationships/breakups has been spotty, I've been in two longterm relationships before him and both of those boyfriends' lost interest. I also don't speak with either of these boyfriends anymore, so there is an obvious difference in our relationship with our exes. He has been very up front about the fact that he is completely committed to this relationship and in love with me, and that nothing on earth could compel him to go back to either of these ladies. \n\nI've been living with anxiety since high school, and it reveals itself at particular times, and I believe this is one of them. I think that these girls pop up as awful manifestations of my own worries and anxieties that I will be left, like the previous times. I do not truly believe this, but that rationale does not necessarily stop me from getting worked up about them. I am not a jealous person, I trust my SO implicitly, but I can't seem to rid myself of these fears. Any advice as to how to handle this?\nTL;DR:"}

Since she lives about 7-8 minutes away walking distance on my college campus, I thought I'd give it back to her instead of throwing it away since it seemed important. \n\nSo I decided to text her apartment mate (who I knew pretty well and had gone to high school with me), asking if I could return the stuff to her instead of my ex, since my ex had said we needed some space and I understood and felt the same way. However, after returning the binder and paper to her apartment mate, who had been very nice and joked around with me, my ex texted me saying I had forgotten to return a gift she had given me over a year ago. \n\nI know I shouldn't be upset about it, but it definitely felt like she did it on purpose to upset me since she knew how much I liked the gift. My question is, did I do something wrong by doing this?

I think I'm getting screwed.\nPOST: Throwaway account, but I need some advice from those with more experience, as I feel like I am getting screwed from bad advice from my financial advisor.\n\nBackground info: My father had money in a Janus account that was in my name, which I took out for college (4k dollars). I had leftover money and decided I wanted to invest it somewhere. I didn't want to have it sit in a savings account making nothing, so my father asked his financial advisor at Edward Jones what to do, and of course he suggested putting it in an Edward Jones account, so I did. This was around 2008, during the financial collapse, and so the money was invested into an MFS bond account (MFIOX). A few years later (about a year ago), and that bond account has done very well for me. However, because of interest rates being so low, the bond account has stagnated and dropped a bit. At that point, I asked the financial advisor what to do, and he suggested moving most of it to MFS Value fund (MEIAX), so I did. And now I am here. I've invested more into the value fund and recently invested into the New Discovery Value fund (NDVAX). \n\nAltogether, I have about $10,000 invested in Edward Jones, but I've been reading around and thinking that MFS is screwing me on sales fees and expense ratios. I'm trying to understand how the sales fees and expense ratios work. I was told that there is a 5.75% sales charge when buying the funds, and that is all I get charged, but I have a feeling that is not true. Can anyone help me understand how much I'm being charged, and if I should move my money into a Vanguard account and ditch Edward Jones altogether?\n\nLinks to the funds I am invested in:\n\n[MFIOX](\n\n[MEIAX](\n\n[NDVAX](\n\nI'm saving this money for a down payment on a house in 3-5 years, unless it would be better to save this for retirement and have a separate fund for a house.\n\nThank you so much....\nTL;DR:"}

The next hour consisted of her telling me that she had the right to be upset with me for disagreeing with her while I didn't have any right to be annoyed. I kept trying to respond with my feelings and actually work something out, but she kept responding saying I was being annoying and she had better things to do, and that she had the right to say whatever she wants. This is a common pattern for her, to ignore things she doesn't like, and I'm kind of offended that she'd refuse to even talk it over with me. \n\nSo now, we're both properly annoyed, and nothing has improved.

She is trying to make it look like she is OK. But she is not. She is a mess but is too scared to say it. She is afraid that she has no friends (they are all out of town for a few months) and she is alone. I am as supportive as I can.\n\nThe issue: I want to help her somehow, but I also feel like I will betray my roommate this way. The brake up wasn't like 'Its not working, we should end it', it was more like 'Its your fault and we should never meet again' (both of them feeling this way). ** I don't want to take any side in this, but I really have no idea how to do that.\nTL;DR:"}

Me and her have been very close since early highschool days, and while we never have fooled around, i have been in very intimate situations with her when i give her full body almost nude massages. Ive been giving her these intimate massages for a long time and when i go over to her place she almost expects it, and wonders whats wrong when i don't initiate one.\n\nShe has made it clear in the past that she doesnt want anything more than friendship, and as much as it hurts i accept that she doesnt want anymore. I want to continue being her friend but i think i need to distance myself from her. One of the main things that is hard to bring up is that i think i need to for my own benefit set boundaries with giving her massages.\n\nShe loves it when i touch her body and compliments the way i do it. I also like doing it during the moment but i feel terrible after i do it, because i know its not going to develop into anything more. i know if i want to get over her and maybe have a normal friendship I can not continue doing that. Im not sure how 1. tell her about the distancing part 2. when we do start to hangout again, bring up the part about me not giving her body massages\nTL;DR:"}

Poor decision making has ruined my life, as well as others.\nPOST: I met someone three years ago that changed my life forever. She stuck with me through tough times, birthed my child, and accepted me for who I was. For the last six months we were together, I abused alcohol, and marijuana, and made her life miserable. It most definitely had negative effect on our child, and I couldn't feel more guilty. I physically hurt this woman at least once a week for that time, sometimes more. I am for sure it will effect her forever, and I can't do anything to fix it. I have such strong ties to her, she will always be my girl in my eyes. And this proves to me how selfish, and self centered I was in keeping her in a place where fear, and substance were commonplace. I am not here for pity, nor am I trying to minimize the problems I have caused. I've never assaulted a woman before in my entire life. I can't believe I would be so complacent towards her feelings and well-being, along with our daughter's. Every second of the little time I sleep, I dream of her. I see her in my daughter, and every moment I am awake, I hope that she will come hang out with us. I'm not hiding any details of what happened from people in my life, and I sure won't hide anything from anyone here. Here's something for context.  \n\nI can't fathom how fucked up I was to do this to someone so close to me. I can't imagine what the future will be like without her with me, and I don't want to live where I do now, for fear of people that know what I did. Don't feel bad for me. I did all of this to myself, and there are plenty of people who will show her proper respect, and give her the support she needs to carry on in life successfully. I have lost everything, and I am so grateful to still have my daughter. I'm not sure where I would be without her. It is my goal to be her rock, and give her the life she deserves. The life I should have given both of them.\nTL;DR:"}

As he drove by, he looked at me smugly. At this point, I glared and mouthed, \"What the fuck.\"\n\nAs I switched over to the exiting lane, he mimicked me, switching in front of me and cutting me off in whatever lane I was in.

Today was the day where we had a pep-rally to get school spirit up and get the athletes pumped. \n\nNow recently there has been this 'epidemic' of sorts in my school where like we have at least one person on crutches in every grade. It seems like getting injured iss the new craze. My school isn't that big so the ratio is quite large. One of my friends fractured his ankle and has been using crutches to get around. Because of this I've been teasing him calling him a cripple and whatnot and he's okay with it because he knows I'm just being funny. \n\nI've sort of adopted this sarcastic mentality to people on crutches and in my last class of the day just before the pep-rally the basketball girl's coach comes in on crutches. Seeing this I blabber out \"Oh look, another cripple.\" I was trying to sound sarcastic and it's supposed to be funny what with the irony of all these people getting injured. But she didn't really laugh and she just sort of gave this sad attempt at a smile. I didn't really think much of it at the time.\n\nNow it's time for the pep-rally and everyone is getting pumped, the girl on crutches is in carried by her teammates in front of the crowd as she is supposed to give a speech (tradition for the captains). She ends up getting really emotional and the coach has to finish for her by saying that she broke her leg at practice and she won't be able to play with her team.

Well after our friends' wedding in November, we decide to go grab drinks and work through a majority of our problems and agree to ease back into a relationship. \n\nWe had broken up because I was in Austin and she was moving to Denton for her specific major.

But he doesn't even want to meet in person to say goodbye.

It escalated to the point where we're now on the verge of breaking up. \n\nMy BF told me that, this morning, he ranted to Sam, who apparently tried to convince him to still get me to come. I still love my BF, but I have a bigger problem.\n\nThe problem is this: I'm so upset about the prospect of not seeing Sam again that it seems, to my BF, that I still want to move with him. And I guess I do but...not necessarily for him. I feel like there's nothing I can do in this situation and don't know how to deal.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm fine with that, I'm comfortable with what we have now, because she told me that given enough time, I do have a shot with her in the future.\n\nWe're in different countries for Christmas break for about 3 weeks. I won't be able to text or see her. We've been emailing a bit, but it still sucks not to be able to talk to her as much as I want. I want us to still be in the same place after we come back, but I'm having trouble thinking about all of this. I'm worried the time apart will give her time to think, and that she may come to the conclusion that we shouldn't ever be together. I don't know why, but I'm having to convince myself she won't hook up with other guys while she's back home and I'm away. There have been no signs that she's going to do that, she actually gave me her underwear with her perfume on it before I left for break, which I think is a pretty good sign for me. I know she lives in a fairly small town and that she could run into her ex. I know they were best friends before dating, but I think she told me she wasn't planning to hang out with him over break, but it's still not something that I can control so it sucks to think they could hang out and she could start having feelings for him again.\n\nI'm hoping the time apart actually makes her realize she misses me and that there is something there. Is there any advice to how I can go about thinking she won't be hooking up with other guys or anything involving her ex? I know it sounds stupid and insecure, but something similar happened to me before where a girl said we'd be good after a break but it didn't work out. Are there any positives I should focus on for this time apart? I'm trying to convince myself there is no reason to think she'd actually hook up with other guys since there are no signs, and that I'm just overreacting.\nTL;DR:"}

He would generally come home in the afternoon with the truck and a significant amount of water left in the tank. So he would do what any good neighbour would do and sprayed it all over the lawns of the people down the street. I jumped on a ladder on the back of the truck to make sure he didn't spray any old ladies or anything. \n\nNow comes the fuck up. Dad finished spraying the neighbourhood with his piss water and I thought he was heading back to our house. Unfortunately for me we live in a cul-de-sac and he was facing the wrong way down the street to park next to our property. So he drives or of the street presumably heading towards a round-about that was a couple streets down.\n\nI was still hanging on to the ladder. When I realised what his plan was, we were going too fast for me to safely hop off. In the seconds that followed I had these thoughts. \n\nI could A. Hold on to the ladder for dear life. Potentially getting thrown off as my dad inevitably takes the corners too fast. Being seen by passing motorists and/or cops.\n\nOr B. Jump off now while we're only doing about 30-40Km/h in back streets, try to hit the ground running and make it back home, none's the wiser.\n\nI jumped.\n\nNeedless to say hitting the ground running is a flawed concept. As I hit the bitumen my legs flew out from underneath me and I face planted into the road. I jumped up instantly and moved to the sidewalk to inspect the damage. Had a few chunks taken out of my knees and waist. I could also feel hot scratches on my face.\n\nAs I looked up I saw a car about 50 metres down the road that would have seen the whole incident. I started jogging home while the adrenaline was still numbing my pain.

It's the bottom of a three-tier front-end management system, and while I'm at the bottom tier, it still qualifies as management because it places me in direct authority over all the cashiers and baggers in the front end.

The hard part for me is managing the employees I've been placed over.\n   \n  While the promotion has been a long time coming (that's a story of its own), I still have pretty much zero professional leadership experience. My superiors give me some great advice, but I'm still trying to overcome the inherent discomfort of my newfound authority over my former colleagues, most of whom I've worked alongside, and several of whom are my superior in age. It's made more difficult by the fact that it's now my job to keep them busy, which in turn forces me to assert said authority, and I'm not sure how to do it without coming off as arrogant or lazy (because most of what I tell them to do are things that I can do myself).  \n  \n  So, managers of Reddit: What ways have you found to lead your colleagues-turned-subordinates without losing their respect or friendship?

I tell him to tell them not to send him those pictures. He laughs it off.\n\n- One of his managers has offered him money to flash them his genitals. Again, he laughs this off.\n\n- Oftentimes they will stay late and all talk about their sexual exploits.\n\n- They often talk to him about his ass, and how they all noticed it.\n\nThese are only a few examples.\n\nThey all know me, and know he's married.

I've been calling up old friends I wanted to invite - some of whom I haven't seen in 7ish years (since I graduated college). Some of them seem surprised that I called, of course, because I've been really bad about staying in touch since I moved thousands of miles away and I'm not a phone person. However, whenever they are surprised, I start getting really self conscious like \"Oh my gosh, is it weird/bad for me to invite them? Did they not consider me such a close friend?\" My take on it is that although I haven't seen them in ages, they were a very important part of my life once, and I would feel weird if I didn't at least invite them (even if they can't come). But now I feel silly/stupid whenever I get off of one of those phone calls.\n\nThese are friends I saw basically on a daily basis in college , so I don't think it's that weird to invite them even if we've been out of touch for a while. I liked them, enjoyed their company, would love to see them again, but would understand fully if they couldn't make it (and no I absolutely do not expect a gift). I also don't think I am misreading our old friendships - we talked a lot in college and even about personal things at times. We hung out socially a lot (as in nearly every weekend). So many of them also moved really far away, so it's been very hard in the past years to cross paths again.\n\nIs anyone else dealing with similar feelings right now?

She's having doubt's about long distance. She feels that she won't want to come to the city i'm going to live in after she graduates school. I wouldn't want her to move for me if she wouldn't truly want it herself. I would hate to have her resent me. She also just thinks that long distance will be too miserable and has a high chance of us breaking up anyways.\n\nThroughout this whole conversation were both really upset and eventually I break down and also admit that if she had No plans to look for work where I am, and I had no Plans to move to wherever she goes (my job opportunity in the city is really really good) then It would not work out long distance for an indefinite amount of time. As soon as I say this she gets even more upset and then left for work and I'm just here stunned and not sure whats even happening. \n\nI guess i'm wondering how many of you have been in a scenario like this? The thing is I truly love her and for a while now I've been imagining a life where we are married. I also realize we are both very young and have career goals that may not be in line at the moment. I am very confused and the fact that we only have a bit over a week with each other to figure this out makes it all the worse.\nTL;DR:"}

There was this girl I always talked to and fooled around with.  We even did some naughty stuff, I know it's weird but it kinda happened.  When we were standing in line for lunch one day I put my hands down her shirt and we were standing their for awhile and people thought it was funny.  One day when I was waiting for someone to leave the bathroom (we had a bathroom in the classroom) the girl sat down near the door while I was standing and flashed her genitals to me.  Of course I flashed mine back, and another classmate happened to see me.  She told the teacher and we were both called into the office.\n\nI remember being really scared because I'd heard stories of people who got in really bad trouble got spankings from the principal with a ruler and I thought it was going to happen to us.  She was really scared too.  The classroom had a streetlight disciplinary system (green, yellow, red) and I ALWAYS stayed on green until today.  We didn't get whoopings from the principal, instead they called our parents. When I got home, my dad got REALLY upset and I got a nice spanking in front of my brothers.  They still make fun of it until this day.\nTL;DR:"}

Am I terrible?\nPOST: I've been in a relationship for the past 8 months. Last year, I started hanging out with a new group of friends. I met one guy that I'm still really good friends with today, I'll call him Jay. \n\nI thought he was really cute when I met him, and it seemed like we had some chemistry and stuff in common, but I soon found out he had a girlfriend of 2 years so I backed off completely. I started dating his friend a few months later, I'll call him Adam. Me and Adam have been together ever since. \n\nI always kind of knew in the back of my mind that I might still be somewhat attracted to Jay, but I never entertained the thought. But lately I've been feeling the attraction really strong for some reason. It seems like we flirt but don't realize it. We're playfully mean to each other, and in general we just have a lot of fun together. He says I'm his partner in crime. If we're all hanging out and I'm about to go somewhere he'll say \"Nooo! Don't leave!\". I think he might be finding small excuses to touch me, but I could be reading into that too much. One time we were hanging out alone (because we were waiting on other friends that cancelled) and he kept making comments like \"People are gonna think we're dating\" and he'll try to list reasons why we wouldn't be good together while blushing and laughing. People have also confused us for a couple on several occasions. The other night he also confessed to me that he thinks I'm cute. I know that's a very low grade comment and could mean nothing, but still.\n\nI feel terrible about feeling this way. I don't want the attraction to grow but I also don't want to just stop hanging out with my friend. I don't even know if this is all in my head. I feel like a terrible girlfriend. I would NEVER cheat on Adam no matter how much I'm crushing, I would never even think about it. But I just want to know how to get these feelings to go away.. am I a terrible person?\nTL;DR:"}

My close girl friend Annie got a new boyfriend two days after she broke up with her ex boyfriend of 8 months, who she started dating two weeks after breaking up with her ex boyfriend of two years. Let's call her new guy John. Turns out John has a close guy friend too, named Dakota. I met John and Dakota for the first time two days ago. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI guess Annie and John pushed Dakota to talk to me that night, but we hit it off because we both love producing music. He got my number and we've been texting for a day. John said Dakota thinks I'm a \"little hottie\" and named me \"My Little Popstar\" in his contact list, lol. He has also been coming on a little strong over text, not sexually but just really open about how positive he feels towards me. However, I got out of a year long relationship a few months ago and I basically want to be a prude until someone wins me over for real. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHere's the weird part. We all met up for dinner the next day and Dakota brought up a trip they were planning with a bunch of friends. He basically begged John to let me come beforehand, and then at dinner he invited me multiple times. He was putting his arm around me and getting really close. Annie trusts John, and he says that Dakota is a nice guy who has only had 1 gf in the past. I jokingly told Dakota that he doesn't know me well and I could turn out to be a crazy bitch nightmare, but he just responded with \"I don't care\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nObviously if I had no mutual friends with Dakota I would just say no. But I trust Annie and she thinks Dakota is someone I should get to know.  Do you think any of this is a red flag? Would it be bad if I go but want to stay in a separate room? I don't mean to be judgemental but I think my friend Annie is going way too quickly through all these relationships, so I'm trying to be extra careful with myself.\nTL;DR:"}

We were a normal family until I turn 14 and started questioning my faith, and I eventually came to the conclusion I don't believe in god. I decided to tell my parents. This is where shit hit the fan. They started screaming about how I'm going to hell, how I'm disrespecting them and am the worst child in the world. It ended with me being sent to my room and telling me I better find my faith or there will be serious consequences. I didn't and there were. \n\nFor the next 3 years they treated me like garbage in an attempt to get me back into the faith. At the end of Church every Sunday I was asked if I believed in God. When I said no I was spanked with a belt for every time I denied. I wasn't given gifts on holidays, made to do all of my sister's chores, called horrible names by my mother and father, and only allowed to associate with friends who they deemed a good religious influence.\n\nI ran away when I was 17 to live with my aunts(49F,44F) in another city and haven' had contact with my parents or sister since.\n\nI eventually got into a decent school where I met my girlfriend, we started dating, and now we're at the point we're at. She knows all about my parents abuse, but she still keeps pushing me to contact them to try to be on good terms. What should I do? I'm not 100% opposed to reconciling but I don't know how much they know about me now or even bothered to keep up with me.\nTL;DR:"}

Our dog came with us, and things have been....okay....up til now.\n\nOur dog has chewed their loveseat in a visible place after chewing it last week in an easily hideable place.

We have 34 days until I graduate and we leave.\n\nWith no income (bf is actively searching for jobs) we are unable to afford to board him somewhere, we know no one in the area, and were told that if we do not get rid of him in 3 days they're going to post an ad on craigslist to get rid of him or take him to the pound. My boyfriend explained (in loud angry words) that the dog meant more to us than that, we wouldn't allow that to happen and we would take care of his behaviour.\n\nCue to screaming match between boyfriend and step-mom, where we were then instructed to pack our things and get out.\n\nDo they legally have to give us 30 days before kicking us out?

Yesterday was a bad day for me. We had this relationship for some quite time, and the last weeks were good even tough we could only be together 2 days per week, since she's working a little bit far from where I am. I didn't notice any signal of weakness dispute the distance, and the things she told me were the same as before (cute things , nothing changed related to that). Yesterday she broke up with me saying that the way she loved me at distance was bigger than when she was near me , in my presence. Maybe because she's lonely all week and I stand by her side, even at distance. I can accept feelings are hard to control but I'm find hard to understand how things change by night and how people are capable of saying things that are not truly true. One of the last things she said was : you're the type of men I want in my life but I can't control my feelings and I don't feel the same when we are nearby. I gave her everything a woman might want, I I was, for sure, always kind and honest. How to deal with this? I'm not mad at her but I very disappointed. \n\nSorry my rusted English.

Last night we went out with work friends and we're having a great time. She decided to bounce and go hang out with her friends which was fine. I was dancing with a bunch of people all night until the end where I wound up more grinding with someone. I made it very clear that I was engaged and that's how it was staying. She told me she was just dancing and it conitinued. Afterwards I got my check and I went home to my fianc\u00e9e. When I told her about it immediately cause I felt a little guilty she said \"it was just dancing and it wasn't like I stuck my dick in her\". I took it as if I was off the hook and we went to bed. I still feel somewhat guilty about it. I would never do that if she was there since she would be the one I'm doing it with. What I can't stop asking myself is if I would be ok with her grinding on another guy.

They don't usually hang out or do activities that 'normal' seeing people would do, and if they do it's always weird and difficult to approach them because you just end up looking like a creep.

I feel it might feel more personal and come off better.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [18 M] seeking help about my ex [18 F], struggling to know what's right\nPOST: I had been dating a girl for 3 years now. Honestly, I don't know how I feel about these 3 years. We've had our honeymoon stage and then fell off for a bit and then came back a little? Either way, I think we were both sort of deciding that since we were probably going to colleges far away and neither one of us were willing to have a long-distance colleges, we were half-assing the relationship. \n\nWell. As things would turn out, during our senior year we both got into the same college of our choice and it just so happens that it's the same one. We were both really excited for this and talked about the things we'd do there but after a week or so were got into a huge argument and she wanted to \"take a break\". \n\nI was ready to be completely done. We'd had many arguments in the past. I can understand why we get into arguments. I can understand why I'm wrong. But the arguments had gotten so frequent that I didn't think I'd ever look back. \n\nWell that was 4 months ago. Turns out it's a lot harder to break from a 3 year relationship than I thought it was going to be, even if was shitty for the last year. I think it's safe to say without sounding entitled that she's still interested. And the problem is that when she does get all cuddly and such, I'm missing it too. \n\nTo be honest, she's probably out of my league in terms of looks. We're  going to an ivy and she sure as hell deserves to go there having worked her ass off in high school so she's hard working and intelligent. We both share similar interests and such. I'm just afraid of getting back together because of our frequent arguments which were emotionally draining. People often say that it takes time to get over someone but this is a high school relationship and it has been months. We don't have classes together and I don't see her out of school. I've essentially blocked her on fb so I don't have to see her and we really haven't talked unless we randomly meet up at events which is when she's showing obvious signs of interest. \n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Instantly hit off and even got down and dirty on the first night. We've talked everyday since and usually hang out 2 times a week, going out, sleeping over each others houses etc. When we're hanging out in person, she's great; all over me, nothing but smiles, always talking and seems happy. \n\nBut outside of that it takes her hours to respond to texts. On Friday we were supposed to go out but she never texted me until 11 at night after we had plans, saying she had to work longer, even though her job she is allowed to text at. The next day, she only texted me twice all day. Once when she woke up, and a random 1 word message Hi around 10 at night. Then today, expecting a text from her like usual when I woke up, there wasn't one. I text her around noon simple asking Are you free tonight, to which she responds she ha to get up early tomorrow. So i just said She's hard to make plans with, let me know a day your free. Haven't heard from her since.\n\nIts really hard for me to discern her intents here - she says I give her the best physical relationship she's ever had and as I said she's wonderful to be around in person, but the lack of communication outside of being in person kind of throws me a curveball. If I care about someone I couldn't go a day without talking to them or trying to make plans with them, so I'm assuming she's losing interest but it is hard to tell after only a few days. I just need some help sorting out the mixed signals I think. If she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with me or is losing interest, just let me know, don't just make me think your happy then disappear\u2026\n\nHow do I go about this? Just wait? Or try and talk to her about it (if she answers)?\nTL;DR:"}

Within a week after that we started seeing each other, but it wasn't exclusive until 2 weeks before the end. After using the breakup as an opportunity to make up with another close friend who developed feelings for my ex, I found out they were having sex while we were seeing each other. I'm not particularly angry about this since I let my ex decide when to make things exclusive, but it would have been nice to know during the relationship. I'm still friends with both people separately but it's awkward when all three of us are together. The other girl is going abroad in a few days anyway, so that may ease some tension.\n\nDuring our actual breakup she said that she still had feelings for me, but her emotions and work were getting out of control. I still have some lingering feelings for her too, but I'm not sure what the appropriate amount of distance is in a situation like this. For the most part I've let her initiate conversation, and she's invited me to eat with her a few times (just at the school cafeteria) but I feel as if our text based conversations are awkward, and this is what annoys me the most. In person our conversations are as lively as always, except for one time when the love triangle was in the same room. \n\nAt this point it seems like she may get back together with the ex that she cheated on with me, and for some reason I've been feeling sad about that even though I don't want a relationship with her again.

And that he had become \"quite fond\" of them during the relationships. \n\nI knew his feelings and emotions weren't very strong but that's just... Sad. And a little disturbing.

Now she's old and I cannot bear the thought of her sleeping outside the bedroom and not understanding why. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (James) and I have been together for 3 years and lived together for most of that. He was never raised with pets but quickly learned to love my moose, by his own admission. He is great with her - takes her out to Poop, gives her belly rubs and throws her ball incessantly. We just bought a house together and one of the major concerns for him was having a yard that the moose can play in, so there's definitely no underlying \"he just doesn't like dogs\" thing at play here. \n\nAs moose has gotten older, her snoring has gotten really loud. Lately (the last 6 months or so) James been complaining about it. So, on nights that he can't sleep because of the snoring, I take her and sleep in the guest room. I feel bad but also feel like I should be the one to sleep elsewhere because I'm the one who can't sleep without her in the bed. It doesn't make me angry or anything to go sleep in another room -I just don't want him to be frustrated about the dog snoring.\n\nBefore this would happen a couple times a month, but the snoring has gotten so bad it's a couple times a week now and James seems to get angry when I take the dog and sleep elsewhere. He always says he's going to sleep in the guest room, but I volunteer instead. This seems to irritate him more than anything.\n\nIn my mind I'm solving all of the problems because he gets to sleep in the bed and get a good night's sleep without interruptions, I don't lose any sleep wondering if he's lying awake while I'm sleeping in the guest room and Moose doesn't have to sleep alone. \n\nAm I being unreasonable? Is there another solution?\nTL;DR:"}

So we kept talking and a few weeks later she told her now ex what had been going on.\n\nShe was in a very committed relationship with him and they were planning on getting married but they ended up having troubles beyond me coming along while she said I sped things up they were already kinda falling apart. She said she wanted to see where things could go with me but then later on said the more she thought about it she needs time for herself. I agreed to give her that.\n\nWhile that happened we ended up meeting we both live in different states and she seemed to really enjoy our time together in a more than friendly way she says she does see a future between us and she loves me but she's just not ready for a relationship after I left she seemed pretty distant we started talking a lot less and eventually her dad became ill and now she is dealing with that but she has seemed to push me completely away. We had a discussion about me moving to somewhere near her as I don't have much of a reason to stay in the place I am other than work but I'm rather confused by her actions.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Buy foreclosure with borrowed cash, fix issues, do a cash out refinance to pay back borrowed cash, ???, Profit?\nPOST: Longtime /personalfinance lurker, here goes my first post. So I found a decent house in a town with low taxes, good schools (have kids), built 1975. The house is a govt owned foreclosure listed for $70k on a $125k assessment. I've been proactively approached by a family member to borrow the funds to buy the house cash. He has successfully helped others in our family buy foreclosures in the past, no issues and no concern for borrowing from this person. He proposed this : buy this house for $60k, fix it up to get a C/O and pass bank inspection, then put a mortgage note on it for $60k to pay him back, and come out ahead. The way I understand it, I would have $55k equity at that point, minus the money I have spent for repairs. Also a lower interest rate. I am fairly to very handy and have done or am willing to do any work besides electrical and structural. The house does not currently have a furnace (but does have all hookups and air returns), and it looks like possible water damage in the basement. I'd ballpark my costs to fix it up to be livable at around $10k, barring the roof being bad or mold problems, or anything else major. I'd of course get an inspection before anything. What say you?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: When is an appropriate time to downvote and why so many downvotes?\nPOST: Ok, been on reddit a few months and absolutely love it. I've upvoted a ton of posts and comments that are funny, I agree with, etc. I've maybe downvoted a whopping 5 or 6 times. I've probably upvoted well over 1000 times. When someone isn't flat out wrong or being an idiot/asshole, when is it appropriate to downvote something? I just don't get it - it could be something so random and not really \"downvote worthy\" yet there will still be a ton of downvotes. For instance, there's a post on the front page right now, \"Any baked ziti fans?\" with a picture of a really delicious looking baked ziti. Its got 315 upvotes (probably b/c people like baked ziti, it looks delicious, and/or they appreciate the effort and final product, etc) but there are also 83 downvotes. Who is downvoting this and why? I don't get it. Couldn't these downvoters just not vote at all if they don't like baked ziti or didn't think it looked good? What's the purpose behind the downvotes there? It kind of just seems like people like being dicks or something - is that what it is most of the time? I do understand the general idea of a downvote, I just think they get thrown around way too much. Can someone please explain? Maybe I'm just too nice or something? What's the problem with being more positive than negative? I suppose I kind of have the philosophy (much of the time) of if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all but for stuff like the ziti, I just don't get the downvotes. If I didn't like baked ziti or was allergic or thought it didn't look good I'd probably just not upvote (or downvote) but why make this person feel bad for something they obviously put effort into?\nTL;DR:"}

I was just out of high school and still very shy; I've since improved.  He made a few comments that made him seem slightly interested.  One obvious example was him wondering if I was going to the bar to celebrate the end of the school year, then saying that I should go.  Now when I do see him around he always says hello, smiles, or stops and chats for a minute.  Very brief, how's it going kind of stuff.  I found it odd that he initiates these since we didn't talk much in class.

I went home, then put the ice cream into the freezer, not wanting to waste a dollar or two. My fridge is split into two parts; the normal fridge and the freezer. Note: my mom, for some reason, likes to overstuff the freezer and never uses most of the stuff in it. I had to squeeze the ice cream. For the rest of the week my family and I were out of town. Fast forward to yesterday, we came back and we noticed a horrifying smell. My mother said it smelled like a corpse, and my sister said it smelled like rotting food. They were both to some level right; apparently, the ice cream was too squeezed and pushed the door open, and the freezer had deactivated. There was blood from the meat, and most of the food was rotten. When my mother saw it she went batshit and screamed her ass off at me. I then had to spend 5 hours cleaning blood up, trying to figure out what was or wasn't rotten, and trying to figure what the fuck my mom had even put in the freezer.

What I have begun to struggle with is the frustration about me needing him to understand how I operate and solve problems.  We end up in heated conversation sometimes, because small issues tend to be ignored.  Whenever I bring up something that bothers me, he shuts down and stops communicating, so nothing ever seems to get solved.  He always wants a day to think and decide what his next move is.  I cannot ignore a problem/argument for a day and pretend like nothing has happened.  I really need to talk about something we have feuded about in order to process it.  He is the exact opposite.

While abroad she started doing stuff like calling me boo (online), liking and commenting on my photos (never did that before, especially saying stuff like \"What a Looker\".. etc) and stupid stuff like that. We text occasionally right now, she usually initiates because well I'm pretty bad with keeping up with people.\n\nThe other day she asked \"Tell me, any ladies this summer?\" and I said not really. But I mentioned I was interested in a random girl just to look like I was looking around and suddenly she won't stop bothering me about the girl until I gave her a name. Whenever I asked her about her personal life, she always replies sarcastically like, \"Oh yeah, you know me!\" (she doesn't party/hook-up/date at all, unlike me (during the school year))\n\nMy second problem is that my good friend dated her sophomore year for about 2 months and he is still a little sensitive about it even after a 1+ year. During that time I was going out partying and I in fact helped get them together, and tried to help them through the rough patch... We've talked about her before with other guys, but I feel like if I dated her he could go one of two ways, happy or totally ballistic.\n\nSoooo, I know this isn't much to go on, but do you think she likes me?

I am in therapy for this still and it happened 6 months ago. \n\nThis with this girl started taking off really fast... we were hanging out all the time. Too much really. But I was falling hard. I was also plagued by insecurities, and last night we talked about slowing things down... She said that I'm not ready for a relationship (she's right), but she wants to still date me casually and \"help me through this journey\". I do need more time, freedom etc.. and am not ready for something serious. But I really like this person. **I'm just a bit skeptical if this is going to work out well, or if it's even possible to be dating someone casually who you really like (possibly love...)**, and continue to work on yourself/build your self-esteem and deal with the fall out of a past relationship. Basically she wants to slow things down.\n\nI took this conversation as a rejection of me.. and was pretty upset. Even though I realize now it was more of a \"let's slow it down situation\". I guess it's confusing as well because it's both of our first time seriously dating a woman. I misinterpreted what she said... I thought she meant she wanted to be friends with benefits.  So I know I'm too fragile right now to be in a \"thing\". I feel embarrassed about how I reacted, like I somehow \"ruined\" it, despite her saying I in no way scared her off. We're taking a breather for now.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (16F) may be pregnant\nPOST: Hi, okay so I may be jumping to conclusions but I'm really scared right now and I need advice.\n\nSo I am 16, female, going to be a senior in the fall, and I'd say I'm an above average kid, with a 2200 SAT and want to study engineering. I've been dating the same boy since freshman year, we're the same age and he's my best friend. We have a wonderful relationship and are close but not attached at the hip like some kids my age. Last summer, I lost my virginity to him after a long time discussing it. We had sex only about 4 times after that. The most recent of those times were May 28, where he did not come, and June 14, when he did. Both times we used a condom, and we were really careful with it.\n\nI usually get my period about the 20th of each month, so the past few days I've been really stressed out over it. However, I could very likely not be pregnant- I am an intense (like being recruited) runner, and I have recently upped my training a lot- I added an hour of swimming to my daily (4-8 mi) runs. I have been eating enough to keep up all the exercise, but maybe it has not been enough despite what I thought. But my mind keeps floating back to the idea that I'm pregnant... and I don't know what to do. My parents are crazy strict, so if I told them what I thought, my life could be over... and I dont want that. I'm scared and confused and I just need someone to help point me in the right direction with everything.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/pettyrevenge\nTITLE: Baseball camp revenge\nPOST: This is my first /r/pettyrevenge story and I'm writing this on a iPod so bear with me! Thanks!\n\nSo just a little back story before I explain what happened, I have been working a baseball camp helping 7-10 year old in the morning and 11-14 in the afternoon. The 7-10 group had these two kids that got on my nerve and I got my petty revenge on them\n\nThe first kid, lets call him Jake. He is one of the older kids I assume as he was bigger than everyone else. He has a huge potty mouth and was cursing on front of little kids, bullying them when they messed up, and he has this yellow ball he kept on throwing at everyone. Once it's time to switch groups he throws the ball at me. The coach. How dumb can you be? Well somehow he manages to forget his precious ball. Since I am on a t-ball field I wait until he leaves and throw his ball into the woods. That'll show him to not mess with a coach. \n\nThe second kid, he was good at baseball but he was a dick too, a different coach and I are running a scrimmage and he has already hit while some other kids haven't. I call him out on it because I specifically remember him batting and he lies to me about it. I say okay just pretending to believe him and when he comes up I throw two balls WAY outside on him and he swings and misses both of them. He gave me this look like he knew I was doing it on purpose so I throw one right down the middle for him. He hits it straight to me. Usually I miss these on purpose so the kids can practice but ooh not this time. I snatched it up threw to first and got him out. Told him to go sit down after that.\nTL;DR:"}

If I win he had to pay for my next meal when we went out, and if he won I had to spend the rest of the night naked. Needless to say, I lost. Lost so bad I spit up more cracker than I ate. He laughed and told me I couldn't back out. We've been friends forever, but he's never seen so much as me in my underwear before. Hesitant, but still drunk I accepted defeat graciously and undressed. He had the best view in the house, and I was getting more drunk by the minute. The next day he recapped a lot for me that was hazy.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How do I [31 M] make close friends as a straight, effeminate dude.\nPOST: I was raised and educated in a somewhat unusual setting, and for various reasons, I was basically exclusively around women and girls growing up (stay at home mother and aunt. My father worked a lot.). I had two sisters around my age (two years older, one year younger) and a bunch of female cousins that i was raised with. None of us were raised in a particularly strongly gendered way, and I certainly wasn't raised as a girl or anything dramatic, but I obviously sort of just went with the flow growing up. I think I first started interacting with other boys my age on a regular basis at like age 16 when a new neighbor started hanging out with us a lot more.\n\nI ended up as a pretty average, hetero dude with some stereotypically female interests that tends to click better with women. This is absolutely nothing against men, I have and have had male friends, but there is still a difference in most men and women interact, interests, etc and I'm just much more comfortable with women. \n\nI'm pretty happy with who I am, and I have and have had both men and women as friends, but always feel a little bit like an outsider and it feels like it has kept me from finding really close friends. My best friends have always been women, but there is always a little bit of a barrier, because at the end of the day, I am obviously not 'one of the girls' and the possibility of sexual attraction tends to mess things up (your boyfriend perceived me helping you do your nails as hitting on you, when we actually just share an interest in nail art, etc). On the other hand with most men, we can be good buds, but at the end of the day I don't really feel like I'm being myself.\nTL;DR:"}

First up, she has a boyfriend but I think it's rocky.\n\nAnyway she's always friendly in work, and often invites me out on nights out, I've been out with her 3 times, but these were mainly when I only saw her as a friend so nothing really developed, in fact both those times I actually left her with her group and went with 2 other girls.\n\nAnyway recently she's been more chatty at work, and it got to the point where she was asking to do other things outside work, but even though I agreed she would never actually take me up on the offer, and instead just full on blank me when I messaged her about it. This kinda sucked and I completely wrote her off as in assumed she wasn't into me.\n\nAnyway weeks pass and she's back to being really chatty and flirty, I often play back mainly because it makes work fun. But here's my issue just 2 weeks back she handed in her notice at work, so she's leaving pretty soon, I thought fuck, I'll turn up the heat and flirt some more in hopes of her seeing that I really like her, I spent the night chatting to her in work, started to tease her, make her laugh, it was basically one of those encounters where everything was perfect.\n\nBut anyway, this is where I am now, she's leaving in 2 weeks, I still don't know if she knows I like her, I've never really been able to make it crystal clear to her due to the fact she does has a boyfriend and that I'd rather not make work awkward.. So what should I do? Is this girl not interested, or should I just go for it and tell her I really like her?\n\nI've met plenty of girls over the time, and while getting to know them I always get bored, or lose interest, but this girl is perfect, to me anyway, it's not even like she's super hot, or straight 8-10, there's just something about her energy.\nTL;DR:"}

I had just recently started watching Jontron, and saw that he put out his video for Space Ace on the SNES ([which you should totally watch, by the way] I plugged in my headphones and was watching the episode when at about the time when Jon said \"Here's the lollipop after your doctor's visit\", some other student approached me and calmly, but sternly, told me to \"turn [my] fucking laptop down\". I thought the guy was hearing the runoff audio from my headphones, and was about to say something, but when I took off my headphones, I was still hearing the episode, at max volume, through my laptop speakers. Apparently, I connected my headphones only partially through the jack, so it was playing through both the headphones *and* the speakers. I profusely apologized, the guy said he didn't care, and I felt terrible. What's worse is that I was in the center of the middle floor of an open library, meaning the most possible people heard it too, so I tried apologizing to as many people I knew were in earshot.

My concern is that not only will this become more and more apparent as time goes on, but that if I keep asking my boss for work, she will summise that my position isn't particularly necessary. \n\nMy two closest friends who have worked for large companies like Microsoft both suggested that I give it a few more days before requesting a meeting with my boss under the pretense that I'm seeking feedback on my performance (during which I will ask for more responsibility face-to-face). This seems like a friendly enough approach, but I'm not sure it will be a long-term solution. \n\nDuring the hiring process my boss informed me that: \"some weeks you'll be slammed with work, and other's you'll really have to dig to find projects\" - so this was expected to a degree; I'm just extremely unfamiliar to what the best way to approach this is in the corporate world.

Shoes, dresses, skirts, panties, bras, stockings.\n\nAt first I considered confronting my husband (35, male) about cheating, but after sitting on it for a few days I realized there was no way those items were from another woman.

He watches TV pretty much every second of the day he's in the house. I hate it, but that's not the entire issue.\nWhat I've discovered that bothers me is that he is not growing, changing, and developing as a person. He is never interested in anything new, never tries a new hobby, never reads a book, never reads an interesting article and says, \"listen to this!\", never has an interest or curiosity in freaking anything. He just wants to watch TV or play video games. The same mind-numbing crap every day. EVERY DAY for 10 years.\n\nFor me, sexual attractive is really mental. I need to be excited mentally, and I have pretty much no sexual attraction to him any more, because I find it a sign of unintelligence to not want to strive for SOMEthing new in life once in a while.\n\nA little bit of background: we have been traveling the world for the past few months in an effort to work for ourselves and be entrepreneurs (I know that sounds douchy). So every day we are surrounded by successful, creative people, and I'm working on our business. And he does pretty much nothing. This is the perfect time to try SOMEthing, since neither of us have real jobs and we have lots of time. And he's just wasting it. Laziness is such a turn-off.\n\nSo, other than this issue, he is a great, patient, caring guy. That's why this tears at my heart. I WANT him to want more out of life and have more interests than plopping in front of the TV. He's so much better than that.\n\nSO, my main question is......how on earth do I tell him I'm not happy about this? He's likely to feel attacked, but if I can approach it the right way, I bet he might actually realize I have a point (it's happened before with other things).\nTL;DR:"}

He also tells her things along the lines of \"I know you are in love with me but I don't love you.\" \nFrank is very into philosophy and discovering the deeper meaning to human relationships and behavior.

Because of this our dog is slightly restless. \n\nFor the past 2 years or so she will occasionally poop/ pee inside the house. One week it could be two times a day, while the next month is perfectly clean. However when she was younger she had some back problems and had special dog fog to treat it.

She's old and tired and well... the pooping that happens every now and then is a hassle. However, another reason is because his girlfriend doesn't want dog hairs in her house. Otherwise she has a large house with a large garden where she would be able to play (we have one in our apartment). I'm moving on Monday 19th and could potentially take Gulla with me. It should be noted that I need a permit for it though and it's on the 5th floor.

I may have posted a question similar before.  Either way, the girl who cuts my hair is awesome.  I've got her number, and friends on FB.  Outside of liking each other's posts or a very random text even more sparingly, we don't communicate except when I'm getting my haircut (which is once a month).  \n\nShe's cool, and I have no idea where she stands on dating or just about anything at all, but we've never talked on the phone (like I said, just very sporadic no-purpose texts, and they aren't common). \n\nNow, I'm not like head-over-heels or anything, but she's pretty cool and I'd definitely like to see if there's something worth pursuing.  How do I go about asking her to dinner or to grab a drink or something?  I've always adhered to \"calling is better than texting\" but since I haven't tried to date in a while I'm not sure if that rule still applies?  And if it does, would it apply here?  Having never spoken on the phone, is it ok to call?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [21 M] got a text from my girlfriend [18 F] if 9 months breaking up with me.\nPOST: So last night, I got out of my night class at school, and I called her on the phone to talk as I normally do. Things seemed a little off but I thought nothing of it. Then, I got home and she said she texted me she was getting ready for bed at her dorm (we go to different schools). And said she didn't want me to visit this weekend, she wanted her friend to come first to have alone time and talk and have me come up Sunday when I get out of work.\n\nShe usually will talk to me about problems she's having so I start prodding asking what's wrong. It's about 11pm at this point and she starts saying that she doesn't know, college is hitting her hard right now and she needs to figure out her life.\n\nSo I figured you was still having a hard time with the stress and workload and sent her a message about that, and she said no, that wasn't it. She proceeds to say that she doesn't want a relationship like ours, we are at different points in our life, and that she loves me and she is happy with where we are but wants someone she can see all the time and be there, not someone who can only visit 2 days a week.\n\nFurther talking she says that it has nothing to do with me and she doesn't know what to do, but wants us to break up, and she doesn't know if she'll regret it yet, and that she won't know how she feels until a day or weeks from now. She wants to get the full college experience and be uninhibited as she puts it. She also said she has been thinking about it for days and that she couldn't handle the physical and emotional stress anymore.\n\nI just don't know what to do here. Just this morning she said she couldn't wait for me to visit this weekend, and now I get this. She still asked if I would come visit Sunday or Monday to talk but for now I said I didn't know and that it would hurt to visit her with things being so different so soon.\n\nI just don't know what to do, any advice anyone!? I want her back and I feel that this just doesn't seem right.\nTL;DR:"}

What do I do?\nPOST: My boyfriend of over four years and I have broken up. The breakup itself started over a comment I made about what to use to get a stain out of the carpet. I guess I caught him in a mood because he blew up at me, yelling at me for over an hour about everything that's wrong with me and our relationship.\n\nIt was really difficult to handle not only because it was so hurtful but because it was so unexpected and SO belligerant. He would say one thing and almost immediately contradict it with another. He was so angry and made so little sense. He turns into another person when he's angry - yelling while insisting he isn't, completely condescending, purposefully hurtful, and just scary.\n\nHe said that he's been feeling this way for a year and half, and that he doesn't know what to do. I said that I love him, that I'm positive I want to be with him, and that I'll do whatever I can to make the situation better if he wants to be with me. After some time he said that he thinks we should see other people.\n\nI feel incredibly sad and heartbroken but ultimately if he was that unhappy and I was that oblivious I know it's probably best that we end things now. Our lives are so entertwined. We moved in together because we spent all our time together, we combined our finances when I got pregnant (we've had two miscarriages), we bought a vehicle together when we needed one, and we adopted a second dog together this year (I had one going into the relationship). I don't know what to do about any of it.\n\nMy family has been incredibly supportive, all offering me help and places to stay. It's not ideal - I love my home and I want to stay here, but it wouldn't make sense to live here alone - but it's all I've got for now.\n\nUgh. I don't know what to do with myself. We had all these plans and now nothing. Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

Last night though I did something I never do, and never wanted to do. I looked through my wifes texts last night. Let me give some backround info, my wife has a very stressful job, and until just a few weeks ago has really hated it, but has stuck with it to help me get through engineering school. Lately though she has been much happier with it. She is hanging out with people from work and no longer wants to up and quit (as much). \n\nMy wife has always been slightly controlling, it's been hard to convince her to be ok with me spending time away from her for my hobbies (mountain biking). She is ok with a few hours here and there but not much more. And a rarely if ever go out with friends which don't involve her, which I'm ok with because she is awesome to be around. \n\nRecently though, she has been a lot cooler about me doing my own thing, something I've been trying to get her more open too for a long time. I'm happy she is doing more for herself too. Frankly, it makes me suspicious, and I really hate that. But I have been telling myself that it's just her finally starting to find herself. \n\nThe last week or so I have noticed a guy from her work texting her a lot. Someone she has rarely, if ever, told me anything about. Last night it became to much and I checked her texts. I feel terrible for doing it. It tore me up though when I saw them flirting, nothing crazy, but you can tell they have feelings for each other. They haven't discussed anything sexual, but for all I know texts have been deleted. \n\nShould I confront her about it? I'm a nervous wreck thinking she might have feelings for this guy. I just want her to be happy, even if it's not with me... I'm worried bringing this up is going to send her back into hating her job again and mess up her career... What should I do\n\nI'm so scared that I'm over reacting and this is going to have terrible consequences..\nTL;DR:"}

She was scheduled to come over at 11 and at 11:15 I get a text saying \"I need help\".  I immedately call her and learn she's at a gas station about two miles away and that she's completely out of gas and can't find her debit card.\n\nBig sister to the rescue!  I quickly dress and drive over to save her.  We meet up in the parking lot of the gas station and I get into her passenger seat to pull around to the pump.  As we're going, other people keep pulling to the pumps we want to use and we wind up on the far end.\n\nWe get out and I start doing the debit card stuff while she chooses the black pump (there's also a yellow one which we assumed was diesel) and sticks it in her tank commenting that it fits funny.  She then tries to pump and nothing's happening.\n\nI realize she hasn't lifted the \"lift nozzle to pump\" flap, so I do it for her (ever helpful as I am).  She fills up and we both leave.\n\nWhen we get to my house, she mentions she was having trouble accelerating and we chalk it up to her having been almost out of gas, decide we'll see how it goes on her way home, and happily enjoy our seven hours of murderous plots, sex, and dragons.\n\nThe time comes for sister to leave.  Her car starts weak then sputters and stalls.  We try it several times, same result.  Weird smell.\n\nI call my boyfriend, who stops by the gas station on his way home from work.  Turns out we somehow put kerosene in it and neither of us noticed (my guess is because we were splitting the tasks of pumping gas between the two of us and were each trusting the other to remember certain tasks like choosing the fuel grade and making sure the pump didn't say kerosene in huge letters).\n\nSo now I'm spending my Friday night yet again waiting for a AAA tow truck.\n\nSome hero I am.\nTL;DR:"}

She spent around 180$ on clothing and getting her hair cut and buying some clothes. I spent 130$ getting myself a new safety razor, some different shaving stuff, and an old school pipe(think something that your grandfather would have smoked from).\n\nI made no issues of what she spent her money on, or that she spent more money the I did, despite her being in a worse financial position then I am(with her saying that I will need to help her out with tuition and rent this semester. The rent thing isn't so bad because we live together).\n\nHowever the whole time I was waiting for my package to ship or whenever I brought it up she would respond with some sort of derisive comment, and then saying 'you're so weird'. This was before I added the pipe in to my order, at which point she started saying 'you're being stupid why do you need that, it doesn't serve a purpose'.\n\nMy brother orders from the same website and I mentioned that I had been able to snag a pipe on my order(they go out of stock within five minutes of having more stock on their site). I told my girlfriend that my brother was jealous to which she responded 'why is he jealous? It's going to be a really shitty pipe anyway' I told her she was being rude which she brushed off. This upset me because I've been really excited about this for a couple weeks at this point, which she knew.\n\nWhen I talked to her about it later on she said that she felt I was being irresponsible with my money despite me Being a.) in a better financial position then her, and b.) her spending more money then I did. I brought these facts up and she started crying and saying that I always try to turn things around on her. I don't really get it. I was calm and concise when I was talking to her and just let her know that her comment made me feel like she doesn't realy care to much about my wants.\n\nAm I out of line here?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU while discharging a patient.\nPOST: I work in a small Surgical Center that is owned by a large non-profit Health System. I work as a nursing assistant in the pre and post operative areas, which includes everything from housekeeping, one on one patient care and ordering supplies. One of my more prevalent responsibilities is discharging each patient after recovery, usually via wheelchair. \n\nOne thing I always try to do is small talk and joke around with the patients and their families as they leave. I've seen a lot of trainees in this job stand silently throughout the entire process and it is awkward as all hell. To counteract that, I tend to keep the conversation moving at all times, which sometimes leads to me putting my foot real deep in my mouth. \n\nToday, during a very rare Saturday shift, I was charged with wheeling out an older African-American woman while around five or six of her family members accompanied us along the way. As usual I tried to strike up the usual conversation, but for whatever reason they were having none of it. Every attempt at jump starting things would lead to a one word answer and then that crippling, horrible silence. After waiting a few cringe inducing minutes for her family to pull the car around, I wheeled her up to the vehicle and began to help her in. As I got her into the car, I said something I've said a thousand times before with no issue \"You are free at last!\" \n\nI didn't think anything of it for a moment, until I looked over and saw her son, who was driving, just staring daggers into me. I looked around and saw that everyone nearby was looking at me like I just tore up the emancipation proclamation. I began to apologize profusely, citing that I said that to everybody, but once again no one would respond. The patient simply slammed the door in my face and drove off without another word. \n\nApparently someone in the family called us back to let my boss know what went down, but luckily they know me well enough to realize that I wasn't racist, just a moron.\nTL;DR:"}

The problem is that my boyfriend of two years acts like they are, and I don't know if he's making fun of me, trying to help with my confidence, or what. He even bragged to his friend recently about me, saying that they're big, which will probably be kind of awkward if we ever meet.\n\nHe's completely accurate about my other parts which is confusing as hell, he's just off when it comes to this. Everyone else (besides an ex that also shared this delusion) that has ever said anything to me about my boobs said they're small. \n\nNow I love my body and I've finally come to accept it the way it is after several years of being extremely self conscious, but...I get uncomfortable when he says they're big.

In May of 2015 I graduated from college with a Computer Science Degree and a minor in Finance; average grades across the board. All the counselors I saw on campus thought that with this combo finding a decent job would be easy. I attended job fairs and applied at companies that I found interesting. \n\n3 months before graduation came around and I still had no job offer. I lowered my expectations for work so I could find something that would at least pay bills while looking for positions more suited to my skill set.

They didn't help at all. \n\nCurrently I am a game tester (QA) for a large publisher in Minnesota. This position has made me realize that if I don't find a decent paid position soon I risk making my degree meaningless (Which I'm still paying an arm and a leg for).

Because my brother lives slightly further away, and in a foreign country, he often shows up whenever he likes-- as in, days later sometimes. \n\nI carry the burden of being dutiful, and accepting the guilt trip of \"ruining the holiday.\" But holidays with my family do not have happy memories for me (abuse, drug addiction, fights, fatty food, and hurt feelings). Even though, my few surviving family members (my mom) have cleaned up their act, I don't have any desire to spend holidays with them. It feels like we're pretending to be a family and it feels very false. \n\nEach year, starting around September, I begin to feel VERY anxious about holidays (sometimes to the point of hives, sleeping problems, recurring thoughts).\n\nAside from full blown divorcing my mom (under consideration but not ready), how can I take this small step to reclaim my holidays as my own and celebrate them in my own way, away from family?\nTL;DR:"}

It has only recently become evident to me that my persistence is paying off, and I'd like to do whatever I can to keep myself on this path.\n\nHe has told me he is bad with money.

Well I'll just wrap this up with it seems so unjust that these data brokers can collect all the info they want on you but if you were to ask to see every piece of info they have access to...well good luck, and if this continues I hope every employee of what ever company is forced to put up a profile covering everything from where they live to where their kids go to school hell why not let people see where they are at every moment in time...they have been doing the same forever\nTL;DR:"}

It occurred to me that every negative thing that we do to each other damages society in some way. If someone steals from a convenience store, they are not only hurting the convenience store, they are hurting humanity as a whole. If someone chooses to act on hatred, greed, pride, or assholeness they are damaging humanity. If one country goes to war with another, they are irreparably damaging humanity. Even the mere existence of an army or police force is a bane to humanity because it is a waste of resources that accomplishes nothing positive to further humanity. Imagine what could be done if humanity's flaws were gone and none of our collective resources were wasted by the negative traits of our species. Imagine if we all worked together toward the common good and in love for our fellow man. How much better off would we be as a society?  I've recently been inspired to work toward creating a better humanity. Watch [The Greatest Speech Ever Made] and you might be inspired too.\nTL;DR:"}

Well, we got separated almost right away...She was fine, but I want to use this as the story.\nHer husband wants some material for the party. It should be rated R material. I thought I could give it a confessional-type feel to it. You know, where there is a black background, and someone talks seriously while images are shown ala  \"Ken Burns\"  from time-to-time. \nSo the premise: \"Acid trip, first time, and somewhere in the evening she touched me inappropriately( made up).\" I want zany, odd, obscure, and intelligent type material.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Girlfriend[23/f] having insecurity issues, has killed our sex life\nPOST: Basically what the title says.  Here's the backstory:\n\nMy girlfriend was diagnosed with GERD 6 months ago.  She was getting nauseous in bed and spent more than a few nights in the bathroom freaking out (she has emetephobia, fear of vomiting).  They suggested she get a wedge or a slanted pillow to sleep on.  She opted to sleep on the couch because she can't roll off of it and the lights keep me awake.  That was the start of our drifting.\n\nAfter a few months of this it began to get better, but she still has bad nights.  It's under control if she keeps to her diet.  However, the rift is still there.  She has gotten accustomed to sleeping on the couch and has no desire to find a bedroom solution.  The couch is an easier, effortless solution.  \n\nDuring all this, her sex drive plummeted to 0.  She wants it almost none of the time.  And now she's having issues with her body.  She has lost a lot of weight from choosing to not eat (because of the GERD).  She skips meals if she has nothing readily available that won't make her sick, yet puts herself in that position often.  Also she eats less when she does eat so that she doesn't get sick from being too full.  Because she's lost all this weight, she has lost her boobs (they're probably down to A-cups now) and her butt has shrunk (it used to be very large, and now it isn't, at least not to her).\n\nIn addition to all that, she has developed awful back acne and chest acne.  I suspect it's from sleeping on the couch (microfiber) without a bedsheet, making her sweat quite a bit in the night.\n\nBecause of the acne and the loss of her \"sexy\" features, she feels very unattractive and very unsexy.  Her sex drive has hit rock bottom.  \n\nShe seems to have no interest in fixing any of her issues, and by extension, fixing the problems we have in the bedroom.\n\nI'm basically at a loss.  What can I do to help her?\nTL;DR:"}

When she is about to have her period, she becomes really difficult to talk to in a reasonable way. She acts like the very spawn of satan. Everything i do is wrong. I breath -> wrong. I don't breath -> wrong, sorta. I tried to talk to her about this issue a lot, but everytime i failed or nothing actually changes.\n\nI have tracked her period and i see that every discussion and explosion of anger is in the 7 days window before her period. I am no doctor, but this is what pms sounds like. \n\nI really don't know how to handle this and i am asking for advice/similar stories. No matter how much caring and loving i am, she always finds a reason to be judging and get angry at my every move.\n\nShe is also ultra emotional. Despite the fact that she is an incredibly good looking girl, she feels absolutely ugly and fat.\nMoreover, she is suffering some eating disorder that gives her stomach pain everytime she eats anything. I told her that when something like this happens, one should go to a doctor. Needless to say, she refuses to go.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, i hope that someone can give me a hint to deal with this kind of situation.\nTL;DR:"}

It was a big silly kafuffle, but the reasons I eventually chose to remain broken up were: \n1. that he doesn't express emotions too deeply (words or physical). He definitely loved me, just none of that staring into eyes or running fingers across skin etc.\n2. he has less motivation in life (I'm graduating university to get a good job so we could move out soon and he was unemployed for 2 years and now finally works in retail. His dream is to do film, which is fine, but it's not paying at the moment.) He also has had debt for 4 years which he refuses to even start paying off.\n\nThese things bugged me a lot and I figured that we want different things in life and he obviously wasn't giving me the type of affection that I wanted.\n\nAnyways, now I am starting to regret it because I know his personality is VERY compatible with mine otherwise. We have the same humour and we were ALWAYS laughing and talking non-stop about random things. Four years and we never got bored of talking. I even called him the other day out of the blue and the convo still flew despite any awkwardness of the situation.\n\nSo my question is, is that type of best friend thing the most important thing in a relationship? I figure chances are slim of being \"best friends\" after this if we don't get back together. I feel like I should just put aside the other issues and accept him for who he is in order to be with someone who I know I will always be amused with.

(details inside)\nPOST: I work for a small company in the accounts department, part of my job is to maintain collections so the cash keeps coming in, the other is to maintain payments, ie pay the bills.  \n\nThe only problem is we don't usually have enough to pay the bills.  This is don't mind, we are working on the sales and things are improving, but not at the pace I would like to maintain regular payments.\n\nThe hard part of the job is that everyday I usually have at least 3-4 phone calls from suppliers who are chasing money, the majority of them are good about it, however there is usually one call every 2-3 days that the person on the other end chasing payment is unreasonable, rude and downright condescending.  These calls don't really do much for my mental stability.  \n\nSo here comes the major gripe in all this.  My boss is the person who authorises the payments.  Each week he usually overrules my plans and payments to suit him. \n\nThe worst part is that he pays himself first whenever a payment is due to him even when employees and suppliers are due for payments to be paid to them, some of which have been waiting over 12 months.  e.g. The boss just came back from a trip and paid himself the reimbursement due to him within 5 days of being back.  He is the only one in the company with nothing due to him, except me, because I know better than to spend money I am not going to get back.\n\nMy question to you is, how do I approach this with the boss and tell him that I am uncomfortable with his behaviour and I feel it is detrimental to the health of not only the company, but me, without, a) getting him off side, he can be temperamental, b) making an arse of myself, c) losing my job, and by d) getting my point across and resolving the issue for the better of everyone.\n\np.s being a small company, there is no one above him I can go to.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel strongly about addressing it directly (vs fading out or dropping hints) but I am curious: How much explanation is appropriate to give her? FWIW, I do not expect her to be crushed by this conversation, however, I would not be surprised if she tries to negotiate keeping it FWB. I am firmly against that option for multiple reasons, some related to the inevitable progression of feelings on my and/or her end, more related to her habits/traits like dishonesty, extreme conflict avoidance, and lack of compassion. Essentially, what were minor nuisances starting off as FWB are complete dealbreakers for any ongoing intimate interactions.\n\nAny tips on how/what to say? I had a great time and I care about her a lot. Frankly, I might be more upset that she's not a good relationship fit for me than vice versa.

I'm six years out of college, I don't make great money, and my skills have largely stagnated. I have vague goals of working for myself, automating my income as much as possible, and spending time at my leisure exploring things that interest me, which include programming and my other hobbies. However, I don't have definite plans to pursue my goals. \n\nMy employer offers tuition reimbursement, so I have been thinking of getting a Master's degree part-time. Right now I have the option of pursuing a part-time MBA or a part-time MS in computer science, and I'm not sure which would be better. I feel that my programming skills need improvement. I could study and program on my own, but I just haven't been very motivated. If I get an MS, at least I would have an extra credential while working on my technical skills.\n\nOTOH, I also think it would be useful to know something about business. Again, this is something I could read about on my own, but the MBA would be an extra credential. The MBA curriculum seems like it's well-suited for managers in a large company. However, I don't think my people skills are well-suited for middle management, and I don't plan to go into finance. I could end up spending a great deal of time on something I'm not going to use while losing time I could spend on my technical skills. \n\nRight now I'm more inclined towards the MS, but I'm looking for opinions and advice from others who may have an MS or an MBA or both. I'm interested in hearing how things turned out for you.\nTL;DR:"}

One even said that if they don't get rid of the cat in the next few days, they are putting it down, all because the cat peed on their daughter's bed when they left it alone to go on vacation!! Hmmm MAYBE DON'T LEAVE YOUR CAT ALONE FOR A WEEK and it won't pee on your bed?? Pets should be for life!

What are the costs involved? Is there any major issues that I might be overlooking like licensing or something like that? I'm not saying that I'd take in 20 + cats and dogs and be a crazy cat person... but maybe just one or two at a time from owners are getting fed up and are close to putting the animal down or don't want to look for a home for it anymore -- I don't know why they wouldn't just take them to the SPCA, there's lots of room last time I checked!

We got the first two (male [referenced henceforth as Mcat],  and a female [Fcat]) around the same time and they got along fantastically, sleeping together and licking eachother etc... A few years later we decided to rescue another cat from the pound, and brought her home with us [Fcat2]. Pretty much the same week, Fcat and Mcat no longer got along. They don't fight, but if Fcat ever leaves her house in our cat tree Mcat will chase her back there. Fcat is also scared of playing with Fcat2 for the same reason, even though she doesn't hiss at Fcat2 or anything. All three are spayed/neutered. Fcat pretty much only leaves her cat tree if Mcat and Fcat2 are definitely in my room, and this is when she eats and such as well. She's still a very lovable cat, she will stay on our laps for affection if the other cats aren't around. We'd just like to get Mcat to stop chasing her so she can feel free to wander the house again.

It was the same day we broke up when he said he never ever wanted to see/talk to me again so I want to respect his feelings but still throw out a line to friendship in the future, just so he knows we have the option to be friends\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [26F] with my grandmother [71F] family is concerned with her erratic behavior lately. Advise welcome!\nPOST: Hi Reddit!\n\nFirst time posting to this sub. I was visiting with my extended family this weekend and my grandmother who is 71 and has been married twice, tells us that she is talking to two different married men on, you guessed it, Facebook! One that she knew 50 years ago from her old neighborhood, who apparently is in the US \"visiting family\" and is going to take her to dinner. The other lives near her and they go out to social events and he apparently comes over to her house when his wife isn't around. He also calls her on the phone. \n\nMy family is not pleased about this. My boyfriend suggested to my mom (her daughter) to ask if she would have been okay with either of her husbands hanging out with another woman when she was married. I think this is a good idea. I understand that she is a grown woman and can make her own decisions, but since her last husband was a loser that everyone (except her) was glad to be rid of, I don't want to feel like I'm just sitting on my hands. \n\nI should also add that she has had extreme mental issues in the past that she had sought psychiatric treatment for. She has recently told my family that she has taken herself off all her medications.\n\nSo Reddit, how do I/my family approach this? Should we just butt out and let her be, or should we try and talk to her more about this?\nTL;DR:"}

At best we get a weekend day together every other week and maybe a few hours during the evening each week.\n\nWe used to speak about how we knew we were \"the one\" for each other and everything was butterflies and shooting stars. But yesterday we spoke about how it's been making me depressed that she doesn't take the time to do the little things for me anymore. I feel that I go above and beyond to make her feel special, but I don't feel much of that in return. She says that she lacks the energy to perform those \"little acts of kindness\"  but that she still loves me. I asked if she wants to peruse this and she said that she didn't know. \n\nWe proceeded to spend the day together and have a lot of fun. It was what we needed.

She wasn't dar away so i found her quickly and when i did i saw her sitting on the floor on the street next to a bar with her two friends kissing each other. They saw me and my reaction was turning back and leaving because i was shocked. After that they stood up and came to me. Her friends left and i said to my gf to explain what happened. She said ,in tears because i was really upset, that it was just a game and that she was drunk ( she also said she did it because they are her friends). She did regret what she did and asked me to forgive her (she really meant it, i know) and promised it wouldn't happen again. I did forgive her but i'm still upset because even if it was another woman she did kiss another person but i don't know if i'm exagerating here, because i'm pretty sure she would have kept it as a secret if i didn't saw them myself and i don't know what else she could do with alcohol.\n\nAny advice or opini\u00f3n is welcome and thank you reddit.\nTL;DR:"}

Maybe a month later, the same friend invited us both to watch movies again and told me that she thought that I was cute. Same thing happened again, would up cuddling, got her phone number, hugged goodbye. And from what my friend told me she's interested in me. \n\nFor background info, I'm in university, and she's graduating from Highschool this year, it's only 2 years difference, so I don't think it's too creepy. Is it?\n\nNow my problem lies in the fact that I've never had any kind of relationship, and don't know how to continue from here, I'm interested in her as it seems we have a lot in common, but I worry about screwing it up. \n\nOur mutual friend apparently asked her if she thought about being in a relationship and told me that the response was positive.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: What happened to dating?\nPOST: **(19M)**\n\nI'm asking this because of \"texting\" and \"hanging out\". It seems like a game-changer that's just making dating harder.\n\nI grew up being taught from my parents, adult siblings, and movies, that dating is something that happens about once a week, maybe twice a month. The first date would consist of an intimate dinner, which the man would pay for.\n\nNowadays, my friends are all telling me that you just \"text\" the woman whenever you want, and ask her to \"hang out\", as if you were just interested in being platonic friends.\n\nThis doesn't sit right with me.\n\nThe whole point of asking a woman to dinner, is to convey your interest in a relationship without directly saying it. I don't ask my friends out to dinner, unless it's an occasion.\n\nAnd why are these women always saying they \"would have paid for themselves\" like it was some sort of problem that I did it for them? Is the \"texting and hanging out\" thing so expected that what I'm doing is coming across as \"just being friendly\"?\n\nAnd I've heard a thing or two about \"hanging out\". From what I've heard, it's pretty much code for sex. I've heard that in this crude version of dating, the guy pretty much immediately goes in for sex without getting to really know or understand the girl on any respectable level.\n\nFrom what I've experienced with texting, it seems like a shitty, inferior mode of communication. Messages are usually extremely ambiguous, and people will always assume the most negative meaning that your message could possibly have, and the inescapable intrusiveness of texts seems so clingy. And we're supposed to carry full conversations with this? This all seems horribly detrimental to the progress of a relationship.\n\nYet these are the expectations that our generation is consecrating. I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy when it comes to this sort of thing, and I'm not going to follow a norm that will become just another forgotten error in the ongoing trial-and-error we call life.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Starved Myself accidentally and now having weird health affects - any advice? Anyone else go through this?\nPOST: Okay, so basically I decided I was unhappy about a year ago with how much weight I had gained post college - I started running and cutting back on how much I ate. I was about 258 when I started (October of 2015), got to about 175 by January and I was about 155 in June. I'm now somewhere in the 144-148 range depending on when I have ate. (5'10)\n\nI run about 10 miles a day, and do a good bit of body weight work. Exercise (I think) is going pretty well. I also found myself cutting back on food quite a lot which was awesome (and honestly why I lost so much so quickly). Unfortunately, because I quit smoking weed around April, I went through a month period where I ate just about nothing (I would eat a piece of chicken, a small salad and maybe some nuts and that's it for a whole day). By the time I got out of that my body had gotten used to that so I just kind of maintained that.\nOver the last month I met a girl who is a nutritionist and she was horrified by how I ate for the last ~3-4 months. Sine I met her I've been eating a lot more like a regular person, but I've ran into a ton of body problems because of what I assume is this sudden intake in food. Constipation, bloating after anything I eat that's not healthy (most meat, fried stuff, literally anything that's not fruit/veg/chicken) etc. I end up burping from what looks like a distended stomach to a flat stomach if I eat \"too much\" ... but that too much is a normal meal for most people (two samosas and a carrot for example).\n\nI have no idea what to do. I'm hoping this will go away over time as my body adjusts to my food but it's really frustrating to look like I'm gaining weight while I'm actually maintaining or losing it. On top of that, I'm really not enjoying these new effects.\nAnyone gone through this before? Is this normal? I can't find any source that talks about accidental starvation and the effects after that.\nTL;DR:"}

But let me tell you something. I absolutely *loathe* photos from my high school grad. Because I weighed, to the best of my knowledge, at least 200 lbs (probably more). I had been overweight as long as I could remember. My parents had tried to encourage me to exercise/eat better/everything good parents encourage, but nothing had stuck. I kept lapsing back to old habits. \n\nIt took another year and a half for me to truly decide to change my ways. That year and half included a year of exchange in Switzerland (dietary staples: bread, potatoes, cheese, very rich yogurt, and of course, chocolate!) and one semester in residence (dorm food - enough said). When I went home for Christmas in 2008, I saw myself in my mother's full length mirror, had a brief period of angry hysterics, and then vowed to change. I had decided I was absolutely done with being overweight. \n\nThere have been some ups and downs in the intervening few years since then. I've tried lots of different approaches, and I'm finally settling into what works for me. I'm now an avid runner, go to the gym 3x/week, and a friend of mine is teaching me rock climbing. I don't follow any specific diet, although I have cut down on wheat/bread products quite a bit. Mostly I just count calories and avoid junk food. \n\nLast week, I received my BA degree. I weigh 150 lbs - an unprecedented weight for me: as I recall, I had already hit 180 lbs in grade 9. I don't recall a time in my public school career when I weighed less than 170.

I broke things off, and cut her out of my life.\n\nMonth later, I find out she's now dating this same guy (nothing physical had happened between them, but an emotional connection which shouldn't have developed did). I feel as though she's dating him because she knew she could get him, it helps her deal with the loss, and in part is to get back at me. Needless to say: I blew up at her, and said some really insensitive things. Now I'm blocked on social media. \n\nI am now 'realizing' that I want her back, and that I should've given her a chance to make things right.\nI do still love her, very much.

I was more than happy to be out of there because of their long history of squeevy behavior (I was basically forced to take a random class after I graduated with my bachelor's so that they could keep me on as a part time intern instead of hiring me as a real employee). Now on top of this, last month (I can't be sure exactly when because I didn't receive the email-but I know it was only about a two or three week notice of the change) they sent an email stating that the PTO policy was changing on August 1st. Where in the past the policy was that terminated employees would get all PTO paid out, and most would usually get some sort of severance package as well (unofficial, so no one banked on getting it). Now, PTO will not be paid out when an employee is terminated. They are applying this not only to PTO earned after the policy change, but to all PTO that was previously earned (and some employees have saved months of PTO to be used if the company goes down- we've been in dire straights for quite a while). Is it legal to apply this new policy to PTO earned under the old policy? My fear is that the company has actually spent most people's PTO money, so would be unable to pay out if many were terminated (and that they know they will likely terminate quite a few in the near future).\nTL;DR:"}

The teacher, let's just call him Mr. Chill, is prob the most relaxed, dope teacher in the whole school until today. \n\nOkay so back to the FU. Since today is Friday, I'm excited for the weekend so I'm happy and hyped. I get to my first class and I greet all my friends. So, every morning, we have to stand and sing (no one really sings though) the Canadian national anthem. So we are standing, and my friend and I have a convo where we talk about what happened the day before (we pranked our friend by getting him a date with a girl he didn't like) and I started laughing. My laughs are kinda loud so my mr. Chill notices. I think he was having a bad morning because he told me to shut up, but I couldn't stop laughing, so he walked up to me, grabbed me by the shirt, dragged me out of the class, and pinned me against the wall infront of the classroom. So at this point I'm shitting my pants because mr. Chill is not chill anymore. He screams \"SHUT UP\" which made me shit my pants a lil bit more. Remember, this was during the national anthem so half the school heard him screaming at me. However he didn't stop there. He dragged me down to the principals office. Where we had a convo with the principal about me not respecting the flag and such. She tells me not to do it again and I apologize. yet she dismissed me but told mr. Chill to stay.  I get back to class and try to act like its normal just to find my friends laughing. pissed at me for getting the best teacher in the whole school In trouble \n\nMr. Chill didn't return to school the rest of the day.

She's pretty good looking too.\n\nand as  for the cons. I'm very smart, not trying to toot my own horn. ive always just been very smart. most of the time i find the things she says as shallow, boring, dumb or just irritating. i feel like i can't really connect with her anymore. like anything \"deep\" she has to say ive already talked/thought about numerous times. And anything \"deep\" i say she usually wont understand.\n\nAnother thing is i smoke a lot of weed ( engineering major lol), tried lsd and shrooms, you know college stuff haha. And she is not into any type of mind altering substance except alcohol. not that this is a big problem, i just feel like it kinda puts up a barrier, especially in the way we think about some stuff.\n\nShe will also talk incessantly sometimes, kinda annoying but eh, girls connect by talking, its expected\n\n  also i feel like i could be really missing oppurtunities here in college bc of her.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm curious if anyone else has been in a relationship like this before.\n\nYears ago I was in a relationship with my college boyfriend (22/F and 19/M at the time). We were very serious for about two years but had a completely mutual, almost friendly breakup. We both simply realized that we didn't want all the things that go along with a relationship - family stuff, friends, weddings, daily talks, etc... and had drifted apart because of this. \n\nToday, we are still what I'd consider \"friends with benefits.\" We live 2 hours away from each other and we both have very busy jobs. We get together every 2-4 weeks on the weekend, have amazing sex, and love spending time together doing social things. We have talked about our relationship and have a strict agreement that if either one of us meets someone else that our current relationship has to end - but we've had this agreement for about 5 years now and neither one of us really wants anything to change. \n\nI remember when I was in high school taking one of those quizes in Teen Magazine about \"what kid of boyfriend do you want?\" or something like that, and getting \"Friends with Benefits\" as my result. This has always stuck with me because, seriously, how does it get better than that?! I'm child free, have my friends, money, sex, and my alone time. \n\nI suppose I'm concerned because my friends are constantly telling me \"oh you're going to get hurt\" or \"you love him just admit it,\" but in all seriousness if he were to call me and say he'd found The One I'd be thrilled for him, and I'm pretty sure he'd feel the same. \n\nI'm just ranting I think, but any thoughts or advice is happily welcomed!\nTL;DR:"}

The reason we broke up was basically he didn't like the person I become when I moved to university. We did a long distance relationship while he stayed back home , and hey it worked out. But as soon as I come back home he breaks up with me because he said he's given me lots of time to get over his past and there has bee too many bad times over the good. \n\nI don't see it this way at all. I see more good than bad and I think after everything we've been through in a year and a half it's worth giving it another shot. Right now he wants space and time to think about if he wants to get back together with me or not and I'm afraid he's never coming back. I know I made mistakes with not letting go of his past and we fought a lot at one point but I don't think our relationship is worth just giving up on.

It also didn't help that I had recently brought up the idea of a committed relationship, which was met with a less than favorable response. Despite the above, we decided to keep talking but toned it down a lot. As it stands right now we are no longer sleeping with each other, yet neither of us are seeing other people. \n\nWhat confuses me the most is that she has told me on several occasions how I am the best guy she has been with both on a romantic and sexual level blah blah blah, and yet she's unwilling to take the plunge, somehow content with this half-assed, non-committal thing we have.

Otherwise I think it leads to a very shallow life of being judged by your external looks, hiding your true feelings and opinions.\n\nI'm sure this sort of post has been done a thousand times before, but I like to think that each one has different content and discussions. So I hope no one is too offended by how generic this post is.\n\nAnd of course, [here] is an obligatory picture of my cat. She thinks she can eat cereal, but can't. Because she's a cat.\nTL;DR:"}

I will spare too many details, but I did not get much of an explanation and he was very upset/crying. We were long distance while he is at college a 4 hour drive away. He told me he would tell me the next time he was home and we would meet up to have a face-to-face chat, and he would give me my books (he has six which belong to me). \n\nMy friend Molly also reached out to him and offered to meet up with him to get my things if he was my comfortable with that. He ignored her.\n\nI dropped off his stuff at his parents' a week ago, and he was there. I asked him when he would bring my books, and he said the following weekend. \n\nYesterday, I contacted him again (after not doing so all week) since he never came by. First, he simply told me he would bring my things to Molly the following Friday. He got angry and said he wants to move on, and talking to me makes it difficult. I expressed my disappointment and made it clear I knew we had no future together, but would like a face to face talk for closure's sake. He told me he wants \"alone time\" and cannot be friends with me right now; maybe not ever. I told him I would not contact him directly again.\n\nTwice now, he has told me he will return my books and has not. If he does it a third time, what should I do? This break-up has been very hard on me, and him having things that still tie me to him makes it harder.\nTL;DR:"}

Everything between us has been as close to perfect as you can get. She's everything I could have asked for. Yes, we do have some problems, she's very clingy and gets jealous easily. I'm horrible at communicating feelings and problems with our relation. But these are things that we can/have been working on together as a couple to fix. My problem lies within myself and is the reason for this post.\n\nFor the past couple of months I've had this general feeling of, what if there is someone else? I'm catching myself looking at other girls, thinking of what it would be like to date them. I've felt like the spark we had when we first started dating is just gone. She's all I know because I've never been with anyone else other then one previous girlfriend, and I don't know if I really want to see what else is out there. I'm having a hard time figuring out if I'm settling for her, or if my feelings for her are true and I'm overthinking everything.\n\nAs of now me and my girlfriend are on a break, and I've really liked having all this time to myself. I've communicated all of this to her and she took it very hard. I haven't been single for any great amount of time since my first girlfriend which was junior year of high school. And I'm not sure if I want to continue with this freedom and lose my girlfriend, whom I can see being married too.\n\nI'm sure there are details that I am missing, so ask and I'll do my best to answer any and all questions. \n\nAny opinion will be helpful to me and I appreciate taking the time to respond to me.

I'm only a GA (Game Advisor) so I get 1-2 or no shifts for the week which, hey, I'm thankful for after this embarrassing incident. So, a father walks in with his young son looking for DS/3DS games. As an employee you are always required to greet customers, which I did, and we struck up a conversation since his kid was taking his time looking through the game selection. After I recommended a few games for the kid we somehow got into the topic of college. I am a freshman in college so I asked him what he liked and didn't like about it and I was curious if he had taken any honors courses. He said he hated one honors course he had taken one semester because his professor had his students do a bunch of oral presentations in class. Me, I have *horrible* stage fright so I could totally relate to him. (I've come a long way, but I used to be so shy I couldn't even talk to people in my class without getting nervous. That's why I applied to Gamestop which has helped me immensely and that isn't a problem anymore. Except for presentations. Still can't do those lol). \n\nI replied, \"Oh, god. I've always hated oral. I've never been good at it and I always get so nervous.\"\n\nRight after those words left my lips I immediately regretted it. Mortified, I tried to play it off but I know I was completely red with embarrassment. All I could think was \"Well. Fuck.\" The father awkwardly and politely laughed it off, but it was clear he understood the damage. The conversation was left at that. Luckily, the kid didn't find a game so I didn't have to ring him up. \n\nScumbag brain.\nTL;DR:"}

I have been to counseling and thought I was fine...but we kissed last night for the first time and I am having some pretty confusing emotions. I *don't* have feelings for my ex anymore, but I can't shake this nagging guilty feeling for liking this new guy. That combined with a new, strange anxiety. Before the aforementioned LT relationship I casually dated a lot, and felt like I was pretty damn good at it. I rarely felt nervous, had practically unshakable confidence and could open up easily. Now that I've had a pretty traumatic serious relationship I am having a really hard time opening up at all. My ex used the intimate things I told him against me as insults when he was pissed. New guy is nothing like that, which is amazing, and I intellectually feel safe around him. The problem is that I am unintentionally feeling super skiddish, probably why it took almost two months for him to actually try and kiss me. I guess I'm looking for tips and advice on how to move forward after an extremely toxic relationship. I don't want to ruin something potentially amazing, that is currently making me happy because of that horrible relationship. I just want to move forward, I'm not talking to the ex and have cut him out of my life almost entirely, so it's not that I can't let go, I'm just confused and frustrated at how different dating feels now, compared to before. This man is seriously wonderful, so kind, so gentle and sweet, I don't want to fuck this up, but it's been two freaking months and I've known him for much longer than that and I still can't open up.

A few days ago we argued over a meaningless detail while planning a date because I thought she was being irrational, and afterwards she later told me it was because of her anxiety that she thought that way. I apologized to her after she told me this. \n\nDuring the date I mentioned how I wanted to start a diet but didn't go into details. The reason behind it was because I have noticed myself being emotionally down and I heard that dieting could help that (I am athletically thin already so I wasn't thinking about weight at all). \n\nAfter the date we talked about \"slowing down\" our relationship to get to know each other better. She mentioned how she also was going to lose weight and I asked her why. She said that she knows I wanted her to and also claimed I didn't care about our relationship anymore. Being the prideful person I am and also caught in the moment, I got mad and told her she was wrong but she still assumed I was just lying to make her feel better. It took a good ten minutes before I realized it was my talking about dieting that made her assume I wanted her to diet too.

The only times she talks to me is to remind me of shit I need to do. When we try and spend time together, she is constantly distracted by something else, beit the computer, or whatever. That, and recently I have found it increasingly difficult to see any quality in her that I love. I feel guilty about how I feel because she has put up with alot of my bullshit in the past. \n\nI also feel guilty because I am crushing hard on her best friend, who just so happens to be my best friend's GF and mother of their child.\n\nI don't know how or why, but I can't help the way I feel. She makes me feel valuable and important, and we share the same interests and passions. We also share the same dreams and plans for our respective futures. She shows interest in me and my life in a way my wife hasn't done in years. I'm sure she is just being nice, but I think I have built it up to be something it isn't due to how shitty I've been feeling. Maybe I am assigning too much value to small niceties. The small niceties definitely make me feel awesome though. Problem is that I doubt that my wife doing/acting similar in respects to paying attention to me will be welcomed in the same way.\n\nI am destroyed, because not only does my wife make me feel like shit on a regular basis, but I make myself feel like shit because of how I feel about her friend.

Not at my bf's mom's house, not at my parent's house.\n\nMy parents don't care about her and Chico being there, but my sister says that she and her husband aren't staying the night at my parent's if Wrigley is there. Their reasoning is that their dog is nervous around other dogs and my sister's husband is uneasy around dogs. BUT, bringing chico is okay by them. Just not Wrigley.\n\nMy argument is that my parents live in the middle of nowhere. They have a large dog run outside for their dog that Wrigley would LOVE to play in. She loves being outside and will have no problem being tied up or in the pen, weather permitting. If it happens to be too cold, my parents have a heated garage we can set her up in.\n\nI completely understand them not wanting 7 people and 4 dogs in one house. Especially if two of the dogs will be in new territory. Boarding is not an option because the only kennel I trust with my dogs is booked full for Thanksgiving. Wrigley is in the process of being registered as my emotional support companion for my high anxiety and depression, so leaving her with someone I DON'T know would wreck me.\n\nI understand people not liking some dogs, I understand people not wanting their house crowded, but I don't understand why having her there where she can play outside and I can see her and check on her is not an option.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.

What to do?\nPOST: Hey reddit,\n\nSo as the title states, my SO is vehemently opposed to me having a joint graduation with a girl in our friend group. The original plan was for me and my friend (18F) to share a party because A) it would allow me to financially and logistically have a graduation party (my family couldn't really have one by ourselves) but B) because we were almost set on attending the same college (and her older brother goes to the college so we bond over that and the graduation party would be \"themed\" to celebrate that). However, she is going to a different school that is coincidentally the rival institution, so we thought it would still be a fun way to bring together our shared and different friend groups in a fun/jokingly competitive environment (with regards to theme we would have it split between the two schools out of jest). \n\nHowever, my SO is very against it, saying it is weird and she got very angry when she heard about the plan. She thinks our friend is too flirtatious but my relationship with her is one billion percent platonic (in our close group of friends, if anything ever happened we would all know--we have a lot of trust and transparency).

She does all of the orders and makes sure that the correct people are billed the correct amount. She works from home and has been getting paid under the table.\n\nMy grandfather just recently retired within the last 6 months and left the reigns to my uncle. Since my uncle took over, we lost our biggest rep for one reason or another. In his eyes he got betrayed. Since they lost a big chunk of business, my uncle was forced to downsize a bit and no longer has the job that my mom has been doing for the last 13 years.\n\nThe rep that dropped our company took some of our sales reps that no longer have jobs and taken them on board. Since my mom has been working with all of these people for the past 13 years and has very good rapport, they want to take her on as well. They would be offering her more money - and allow her to step right back into exactly what she was doing before and work from home. They also said there would be room for higher pay down the road depending on how business goes.\n\nMy uncle sees this as deceit and does not want my mom to take the job. In his eyes if she took the job she would be a traitor. He does not have a job for her and she would be getting paid more with the new company. Since he feels like he was betrayed by \"x\" company, he feels like it would be a slap in the face for my mom to take the job.\n\nThis would be a great opportunity for my mom to get a real job with a legit company and room for growth, not just some under the table family gig.

We spent another year staying friends and then he started dating someone else, I realized I'm not over him, and had to totally cut all contact with him to try and heal. I most likely won't be talking to him for at least a few years even though it really hurts me.\n\nNow the problem:\n\nThroughout this time I've come to really like his friends. We're not super close or anything but I enjoyed hanging out with them even when he wasn't around and still after the breakup. We play together, chat, and just chill out, and they've become pretty important friends to me even if they're not the kind I'll talk to about personal stuff, as I enjoyed spending time with them a lot more than some of the friends I had before the relationship (very toxic group dynamic). They're all really awesome and I'd really like to stay in touch with them, but I can't handle being around my ex at all, let alone his current gf, it's just too much for me. Is there any way to stay in touch with them without feeling like I'm splitting up the group / drama mongering / etc? We spent a lot of time chilling in my ex's Mumble channel so this won't be that easy but if there's any way to do it tactfully I'd like to. I feel like it would be wrong of me to invite them to an event / different Mumble channel / anything like that without him as he's done nothing wrong and I'd never want to exclude him and I feel like they'd see it in a bad light, I just personally must for my own health stay away from him.

And also since the money I have is \"mine\" but I didn't earn any of it, I don't want the jewelry to be like..giving her back her own money, or worse, my dad's money (since he gives me a large portion of my allowance as he is much wealthier).\nTL;DR:"}

All we've said to each other is \"Hi nice to meet you\" and that's about it. I work in the above ground section of this store and she works below. Basically I have no reason to be downstairs and she has no reason the be upstairs. I'm really not sure how to spark a conversation, not to mention I've got very little experience talking to girls in the first place. I found her instagram and snooped a little, which I'll admit was weird but I really wanted to know more about her. She's wildly out of my league but I would really like to get to know her. Judging by her ig she's super fun to be around and all-in-all a good person. \n\nSo I'm really just looking for ideas to get to talk to her and she if she wants to hang out.

She has taken an internship in a city about 2 hours further away then we are used to.\n\nI love my girlfriend, however I do feel somewhat rejected. She has accepted an internship/job this summer in a place that makes the regular distance of our relationship even worse.

I wouldn't spend 2 years with someone unless I genuinly wanted to. However, this series of events has greatly altered my views on the matter. The two previous summers I have spent with her (we both held regular, weekday hours jobs), but now we are facing a moment where we may not see each other for up to a month at a time. \n\nI don't want to be selfish, but this situation both hurts what I expect out of a relationship and where I want to be today.

We've been together for almost a year now (we are both Grad students, he's in business, I'm in law). When I first dated him (ten months ago) I didn't know what to make of him, he was interesting, but I wondered about how much he really loved me (he comes off as very cold and un-emotional, he's a very analytical man with the mind of a businessman). Well I found out who he truly is.\n\nA few days ago I fell ill. Migraines, vomiting, high fever, it was not pretty. He took two days off to care for me. He came over to take care of me for a few days. He made me soup, massaged me, held my hair back as I vomited, got my vitamins and medication, scheduled an appointment with a doctor, all the while telling me how beautiful I was (I looked like a train-wreck) and writing me powerful, beautifully written love poems that i would wake up to after taking long maps. He set up movies for me to watch and would run warm baths for me (he never once made a sexual advance towards me), although after I got better we made love (he's a selfless lover). Throughout he showed such kindness, he always has shown me kindness yet he's very cynical and often assumes the worst of others (he doesn't assume the worst of me though). I just never expected such love from him, nor have I experienced such love from a boyfriend before (and I've had many). \n \nNow all I can do is think of him, I feel in love with him so much more since he touched my heart. Afterwards, when I felt better, I stripped naked, took his hand to my chest, and told him that my heart is his (I've never done that before). I'm just asking for things I can do to show I truly love him and appreciate him, I have a bunch of ideas (writing poetry, kissing him, etc...) but I'm looking for unique ways to express my love for him.Any thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

Together over the past years, I feel I have been instrumental in helping her recover.  I know I am her rock, and she knows she can rely entirely on me for support.\n\nShe always had a stranger sexual appetite than me, but I was always open to trying new things, and we discovered each other sexually.\n\nThe other day we were lying together in bed, she told me she had a fantasy she had been wanting to act out with me for a long time, but was unsure to tell me about it.  She told me she liked the thought of sexually playing out her own rape experiences, where I am the rapist.  I think she instantly noted the change in my expression, because she stopped smiling instantly afterwards and I think she knew this freaked me out.\n\nI really don't mind acting out fantasies, but this is just weird.  This is something she struggled with for many years, and I know its still a sensitive and traumatic topic with her, and sometimes she even gets triggered.  I can't bear the thought that she would associate me with the person who did those things to her, who raped her.

Currently, she's in a D/s relationship and he's (her Dom) off somewhere until the end of July, but their relationship is open.\n\nToday happens to be her birthday, and I gave my well wishes. To my surprise today, she invited me over after seeing my birthday wish, to come by and smoke up a little. Interpreting this as a play situation, I went for it, especially since there was no news of anyone else being there.\n\nSo, I get there and the first thing out of her is: \"So, my partner is upstairs and really high... so, don't mind him.\" Inside I was like... \"LOLWUT\".\n\nI get up there, and being raised to be hospitable and offer my guests something, she says \"oh, hey.. we haven't eaten much today, so.. sorry about the cooking.\" I got there around dinner time, so this just added to the weirdness.\n\nBeing unsettled, I facebook messaged my FwB who's poly with me and was informed of me being there.

Birth control decreases my sex drive quite a bit. I have tried going on other forms of birth control (shot, other pills, patch, etc. except for implants, which I am uncomfortable with) and they all decrease my sex drive among other side effects (headaches, excessive weight gain, nausea, etc.). The pill I'm on now (Lutera) only gives me a low sex drive...thats it. Which is why I prefer it. However, have any of you found effective ways to increase sex drive while on the pill?\n2. Most of the time when he uses a condom, he has trouble staying hard? Any advice?\n3. He wants me to either go off the pill or stop using condoms. I want to use both. Condoms are not 100% effective and i have seen friends get pregnant while using them PROPERLY, including myself (got an abortion and never want to go through that again). Also, I sometimes forget to take the pill at the same time everyday. I am a full-time college students with 3 jobs so I tend to forget to take it, which is why I also use condoms.\n4.

To top that off, the new job is paying for me to go back to school. I have a degree, but they want me to get another one (in a different field, which I am absolutely happy to accept).\n\nThat being said, both my wife and I work. And we carpool. Fortunately, she works close to her parents house, and they watch our son during the days, which certainly saves in daycare costs.

We never made our relationship explicit and see each other only about once a week, I think it borders on fwb territory, but we've seen each other enough times that I think a face to face talk is required (probably like 15-20 times, over like 4 months).\n\nMy main question, and it seems like an extremely simple one but Im kind of stumped by it, is how do you arrange to be in the same place for the break up to happen? The reason this is tricky is we live in a large city, the commute from hers to mine is a little over an hour, and we only see each other like once every week or two for a planned date/hookup. So inviting her over to my neighborhood for a date then dumping her feels crappy, she'll have spent 2 hours on the train to get broken up with. \n\nSimilarly, if I plan a date with her in her neighborhood I don't mind making the trip but then we'll have planned a dinner or something, and it doesn't feel right to tell her Im taking her out and then break up instead.\n\nI could text her and just say I want to come over and talk, but I think that will make it pretty obvious something is up, she'll ask follow up questions, and before I know it Im breaking up over text which I didnt want to do.\n\nRight now my plan is to just head over to her neighborhood, shoot her a text saying Im around and would she take a walk with me, and just hope she's around and says yes otherwise Im stuck making the train ride home and making a new plan. Probably can only try this once since she'll be wondering why I keep showing up in her neighborhood asking for walks, she'll ask, and we're back to me explaining myself and breaking up over text.\n\nThis seems like a pretty common scenario, how do other people who live in large cities deal with this?\nTL;DR:"}

I don't like fake looking breasts necessarily, just bigger ones and the thought of them getting bigger. I have a great girlfriend with a killer body. She even has great large breasts. But I cannot stop fantasizing about the being bigger. Like, slightly more than my handful. I have had this type of fantasy my entire adult life. I don't like that I like it, but when I think about it, I get very, very turned on. It is just a fantasy.\n\nI love my girlfriend and I would never bring this up with her. I hate the idea of what that can do to a person. I have nothing to change about her. I am going to propose soon, too. I don't even support plastic surgery very much. I mean, in cases of reconstruction or it affecting somebody's life or their own personal decision, more power to them. I just think surgery is a large health burden and expensive, and not to be taken lightly.\n\nI guess I'm saying I think I should keep this fantasy a secret? Is it wrong for me to have this \"thing\"?

My husband and I are having an issue with our daughter at bedtime and I need your insight, advice, stories of victory, and wisdom. Our daughter is 3.5 and she has always been good about sleeping. Normally she will have her bedtime routine, put her to bed in a quiet dark room with no toys, and she is out within 30 minutes. \n\n**The problem:** within the last month she has developed the giggles at bedtime and will stay awake laughing at nothing until 1-2am. She does not get out of bed or play with toys but entertains herself into the wee hours of the morning leaving her exhausted the next day. We know she is tired at bedtime. She will have a busy day at preschool and will even be sleepy at bedtime, but she will not go to sleep. \n\n**How we've been handing this so far:** My husband and I will go into her room when we hear her playing and tell her firmly \"daughter it's time to close your eyes and go to sleep.\" We use reasoning with her to explain \"did you enjoy being tired and grumpy yesterday morning?\" \"No.\" \"Well how do we fix that then?\" \"I need to close my eyes and go to sleep.\" Cue 10 minutes later the giggling. It is driving us up the wall. It affects her sleep and ours. We cannot sleep knowing she is awake and we also need to be awake to handle disciplining.

They seemed mysterious, inaccessible and otherworldly. By the time I turned 17 I got to my senses and finally realised I was attracted to girls. I was not very sociable and I was scared of them.

By 20yo I realised they weren't that inaccessible. \n\nNow I can talk to them without being awkward and one of my best friends is a girl. But I feel depressed. I have such expectations.

For me this is my first relationship ever. My boyfriend on the other hand had a rather serious relationship before me (He was single for about a year before we started dating). I don't know all the details but they were together for quite some time and during that time his ex cheated on him a lot and the whole relationship was very off and on again. \n\nThis wouldn't bother me in the least and at first it didn't but it's just that he's mentioned his previous relationship quite a few times (though what he says is never positive). First it started bothering me when I complained that he's not romantic even though I am and he always enjoys the little sweet surprises and notes that I leave for him but never really reciprocates. During this conversation he said that he used to be romantic in his previous relationship but because it ended so badly he doesn't do that anymore. I wouldn't even care about the romance thing, but this really hurt. And I told him that, he knows. \n\nLater on I found out that one of his best friends told him that his ex is now married and expecting. How normal is it that he's upset about it? I don't have any exes so it's hard to tell for me but before we got together there was one guy I was madly in love with but it didn't work out, but I don't really care about him because I love my bf. Why would he care so much? \n\nAnd now, recently I noticed that he opened a link on his phone that his friend sent him and it was a picture on facebook of a couple. He stared at it for like two minutes and it just made me wonder if that wasn't his ex again. \n\nAll in all, I just want to know if it's normal that I'm feeling jealous and bothered by all of this? Or is it normal since it was his first serious relationship? I feel like this is eating me up inside and it's hard for me to tell if these are just intrusive thoughts or my emotions are justified.\nTL;DR:"}

Generally this entails mass upvoting to promote a link, or mass downvoting to censor certain views. In most (if not all) of the cases I've read about, this artificial voting is done by accounts controlled by bots.\n\n**Thus, it seems that a simple, elegant fix would be to remove the vote function from the API.**\n\nAfter all, shouldn't it only be real users, not bots that are voting?

Then, once she knows and the proposal is no longer a secret, I won't have to be so secretive about actually making the trip to get the diamond. I wouldn't hide the fact it's a CZ, I'd probably tell her that at the time, but that this was the only way I could get a 'finished' ring in time for proposal.\n\nLadies -- How would you feel about this? Is this bad etiquette/poor taste? Is it better to wait 'til I have the \"finished product\"?\nTL;DR:"}

Unlimited college food and my horrible portion control did me in. I went into college at 122 lbs. Still a little overweight for my size (according to BMI), but not by much (I think it was recommended that I be between 115-117 lbs). I didn't do much for activity aside from walking to my friend's house (1 mile round trip) and 100 crunches every morning. It helps that my mom never had food in the house, so I really didn't eat a ton. Now, I'm at 148 lbs, and just miserable. I decided that I want to get down to my weight before college and stay there, or possibly lose more weight, but I'd be happy at 122 lbs again. \n\nI'm trying the Dukan Diet and wanted to get another opinion on it. I planned on kicking most carbs, juice, soda, and processed foods to begin with. Also exercise, walking, yoga, and light weight training (getting a gym membership while I'm home, hopefully).\nTL;DR:"}

How do I deal with this?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 years now, since we were both in college. We get along great almost all the time, we understand each other. I love him dearly and I know for sure that I'm the most important person in his life. In fact he's already expressed for a while that he'd like to get married and have kids eventually. Sounds ideal, right?\n\nProblem is, we do have some incompatibilities that have surfaced over the past ~4 years, which we've talked about and I've tried to overlook or give some time for the sake of our relationship...but at this point, I'm losing my hope that things will work out. He's stubborn and doesn't want to make change anything about himself, even though I make it a point to adapt to him when I can, and even given more time I'm getting skeptical that our few incompatibilities will ever iron out no matter how much I ask him to try (which yes, he will agree to try sometimes). I'm torn by how much we love each other and how these few things are throwing a wrench into us having the perfect happily-ever-after kind of deal.\n\nTo make it worse, my mother has been opposing our relationship for a while and has somewhat coerced me into admitting that I think some things aren't working out between us and that it'd be best to break up. My mother and I are usually best friends, and I value her advice and insight...and I know a lot of what she says is true, but I can't help feeling incredibly sad about all of this.\n\nI know it's a rookie mistake to hope for someone to change in a relationship. But back in my mind, I still naively hope that he will, and no matter what happens between us I still love him to bits. Meanwhile, the rational, logical part of me has committed to breaking up with him. I feel so heartbroken and conflicted about the whole thing...any words of advice, Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

The build-up of fluid in her lungs is now going towards other parts of her body causing major swelling hindering her mobility. She cannot sleep because when she lays down she is in pain.

The doctor has already said there is no way to cure her, and that her medication will only delay the inevitable. After hearing that, my grandmother refuses to take her medication. She is in the mindset where it is just her time to leave, and does not want to even try to live. It's heartbreaking seeing her like this. I talked to her about it, but she shrugs it off and says that this is what old age does. Her face recently got swollen and she refused to go to the hospital.

Part of me would like to just lie and say i used to smoke some weed but don't anymore, but i know there is a polygraph test later on in the interview process and that is a risky situation. I would like to think that my experience in these areas makes me a more valuable candidate because i could easily spot someone on drugs, and understand the thought process of people under the influence of different substances.

Dinner ended pretty horribly and my friend has been pretty weird every since. We sorta apologized later but even after things have been strange. I confronted her 2 days later, but she said that she isn't ready to tell me why she'll still upset, and doesn't know if she'll ever be. The problem is that this has happened before (where I asked her what's wrong, and she said she can't tell me) and I can tell the same thing has bothered her on multiple occasions.\n\nShe says that I'll probably be hurt by what she has to say and she's overreacting at something that I can't help because it's just who I am. She says she understands the reasons I behave this way, and usually she can just let it go. \n\nI get that she needs time and I should let her be. But really, I see this a reoccurring problem that she refuses to talk about, and frankly it's straining our relationship. Sometimes I get really fed up with her behavior. It becomes almost passive-aggressive where it's obvious she's upset but won't admit to it. And when she does, she refuses to say what's wrong. Honestly, it won't matter for long because she's moving out in a week. This is just really bothersome and most likely when she leaves it's going to be on a sour note.\n\nShould I just keep letting it go and pretend everything is okay?

It was my boss. I texted him again real quick, \"Oops wrong text lol.\" A few minutes later I ran into him and he actually felt bad for me that I had to stay late. He never gave this woman permission to hold me late so as soon as I finished what she told me to do, my boss marched right up there and told her I was going home.

We had been living together for about 8 months and we were both under a lot of stress. The last 3 months were rough. We flight constantly, were not nearly as affectionate and lots of accusations on both our parts were flying around. It all came to a climax one night last early December and got very physical. We had gotten physical with each other a few times before (me slapping, him pushing) but this was bad enough I was taken to the hospital after the police arrived and we both ended up with strict protective orders.\n\n Anyway, we both did therapy (me: private sessions with a shrink, him: anger managememt groups) and got back in contact with each other in April.

My laundry, gas, rental car, and hotel is paid for on the road in addition to perdiem & the weekend a month i go home I stay at either my parents or my girlfriends.

My goal is to have $40-50k in my account by July and to then find a new job.\n\n**The Question**\nWhat should I be doing with this money that I am currently putting into savings?

During that time I lost 8 family members and had a couple close calls with 2 more (one had brain surgery one had a new colon surgery). Partially because of this I got very depressed and I dropped out.\n\nNow I have my head on right and I am trying to get back in there. I went through all the right channels filled out all the paper work and did everything I was supposed to do and they told me I was welcome to come back. I was feeling great until about 2 weeks ago.  I was told that I was missing some school required Financial Aid paper work and it was due right away. I am quite sure that I turned in the exact form that they were asking about around the first of June but they \"had no record of it.\n\nI scrambled to get it done and faxed and get the proper signatures. I got it done while I was at work, I thought that would be the end of it until today. I received a message that the form was incomplete, so I cannot receive financial aid this year. I too broke and my family does not make enough to pay for my college. The worst part to me is that I have just come out from under a deep depression and was on cloud nine to know that I was coming back only to fall again.... I feel awful right now.\n\nSo my question to you is what can I do now? I already work full time and its just not going to be enough. I there another way to get some monetary help?\nTL;DR:"}

My current gf said that I was holding on to my ex and even if there were positive times in that relationship, her being a shitty person and doing shitty things in the relationship makes the entire relationship shitty.\n\nI don't feel like I'm holding onto anything.

He didn't want to come out to me either but his friends persuaded him into doing so (this was about 5 years ago) Our parents are pretty conservative and have no idea my brother is gay and so does most of our family and friends.\n\nOkay, so... here's what happened. I only wanted to check my email on our family's computer (we still live together) and I found that my brother was still logged in. I noticed a string of Craigslist emails regarding meeting up with individuals (who were way older than my brother, around mid-thirties) for casual sex. Now, I know it was a major invasion of privacy but when I see an email that they want to meet up at strange times in the night, I'm obviously going to be a bit concerned. \n\nWell, I confronted my younger brother about this. I told him I was concerned and worried. I told him to stop doing it because it didn't seem safe. He told me that he's going to keep doing it and that he's sorry that I found out. He also kept telling me that he still doesn't feel comfortable with me knowing about his sexual orientation. Then he listed people who he trusts more than me. I was a little hurt because he just went on and on about how he doesn't trust me. I've always considered him as one of the closest people to me.

I take it that her new job at a start-up company has been really hectic.\n\nThen last Saturday, I see her crying in our room. She's incoherent at first but after she calms down she tells me that she wants to break up. Apparently, she's been on the fence about it for the last 2 years or so now. She says she's unsure of a lot of things in her life; her career, her relationship with her family, her faith, etc.\n\nShe hasn't been able to see her old friends as much since then though I never discouraged her from doing so. She's also barely been able to go to her church since then. According to her, her entire world revolved around me somehow and that she never got to grow which was why she left home to \"become independent\".\n\nSo now she's breaking up with me because she feels that it's unfair to stay together when she's unsure of her feelings for me and also to find her own identity; one that that isn't defined by our being a couple.\n\nI've never dated a girl this long so it's particularly hard on me and I'm not sure how to deal with this situation. I don't want her to go but I kinda get what she means. I can't get myself to get angry because of that. I don't want to bring this up with my closest friends since some of them live with us.

She is cheating on her husband or something.\nPOST: I feel like I don't even know my own mother anymore. She is currently married and, according to her, in love. She met this man in our home country and she is in the process of bringing him to the United States. I've met him and he's, indeed, a good man (at least it seems to me). Everything seemed fine to me. In her own words, she is deeply in love. \n\nToday I found her basically sexting another man. She sent him pictures of her in lingerie. I snooped, yes. Anyway, that's not the point. The point is, what do I do? Do I leave this alone and forget it? I just feel weird towards her now. Like, what a whore right? I don't want to say that of my own mother but if it acts like a duck, quacks like a duck... well you know. \n\nA little history: She is widowed by my father who was basically *her* father because he was controlling and she was basically his bitch (her own fault though, she did not need to stay with him). She's the kind of person who thrives on being a victim I suppose. She basically lives for people to tell her, \"oh poor you, you're a saint for putting up with so much\". I understand that after being in that kind of toxic relationship, you want to \"live your life\" but damn. I don't know what to think. Maybe it's none of my business. I'm not sure.\nTL;DR:"}

She's told me that they've made out a few times, as recently as two years ago, but that there's nothing between them now. He has a girl that he's seeing, but I'm still thinking that its weird that my gf and him are still so close; it makes me nervous.\n\nProblem is, she tells me things about the guy that don't make me too comfortable. He got pissed at her when she told him about me a month ago, wondering why he didn't know sooner and generally being a little bitch about it. This weekend, my gf went to a party with her friend (girl) and met up with him, he ended up sleeping at her cottage with two other guys, my gf and her friend. my gf then says to me that she doesn't like his girl, which started a fight as I'm wondering why she would even care if she doesn't have feelings for him.\n\nI'm not overly worried that anything happened between them, but she's not doing herself any favours by continuing to hang out with this guy. I'm not gonna tell her to stop seeing him, I don't want to be that controlling, but it makes me angry that my gf can't see how this situation bothers me. She just blows it off every time I bring it up (rarely), saying that nothings gonna happen and that I'm overreacting.\n\nAm I being too overbearing on this situation?

She's pretty cool, and I do find her attractive. I had my suspicions, but I found out today, that she probably likes me. Her friend made it a point to make sure we took or breaks together, going as far as to say she wanted to take her breaks the same time a me. Combined with weirdly suspicious behavior (giggles, a note I couldn't read, out of the way effort). I'm comfortable with my deduction, based on these facts.\n\nMy dilemma is that she is 6 months pregnant. I don't know if I want the (for lack of a better word) drama that would go along with that. I already have a kid, and the potential problems that could come with this scares me. I don't think she's knows I have a kid, or that I'm divorced, I'm not very open with my personal life.\n\nI would like to see where a relationship could go, but I don't want her son to think of me as a dad and then it doesn't work.

She had a brain tumor (benign, thank god) but had gotten prescribed xanax after the surgery.  \n\nI was having random drug tests, and could't smoke marijuana because it stayed in my system for too long.  So I heard that xanax could get you high, and decided to give it a whirl.  \n\nShe was asleep for the night and left the bottle of pills in the kitchen.  I took the bottle to my room and saw that there were about 15 1mg bars in there, a lot.  I didn't know the correct dosage, and being too young to be smart, I took 3 of the bars right down, and thought that I would bring the rest of the bottle of pills down in a while.  \n\nNext thing I know, its 4 days later, and I'm waking up at 4pm.  I go downstairs to an upset mother who is angry with my confusion.  After some shouting, I learn that I blacked out immediately on the xanax, hid the pills, and kept taking them and acting normal enough to get by for a day or two.  Then my mother found the bottle and realized that I was in a total blackout.   She was absolutely pissed and I was grounded for a LONG time.  I even had to move my mattress into her room and sleep in there for a week so she could make sure I wasn't taking drugs at night.\nTL;DR:"}

Are there \"rules\" about this? \n\nThere's also a large chance that I'll get off work early tomorrow and, if so, I'll probs just head over to the coffeehouse early (it would be like 15 minutes or so, I work really close). In that case, would it be weird if I texted her something like \"Hey I got here a few minutes early to grab a table, what's your drink order?\".

She denied it vehemently each time he was brought up even if I didn't about it.\n\nFinally TS called and told me and said he didn't at first for his own selfish reasons. I confronted her and she still lied but eventually gave in. Since then I don't look at her the same, I barely get turned on by her or at all really. All I think about now is how she got fucked by a meth-head in a gas station parking lot at 2 in the morning and how she lied about it. What do I do? Kick her out, take a.break, work it out, look the other way?\nTL;DR:"}

Certainly not years long, certainly not just weeks long either. A lot of times, I end up feeling like I'm continuously running into this brick wall, and that also includes being a brazen little asshole, telling her of my affection towards her to which I will receive no confirmation or affirmation, just avoidance in the most subtle form.\n\nA lot of that happens and I get let down a lot of the time. Ever since I ended my first relationship, I've learnt to expect less and appreciate more, but this really takes the cake. \n\nAnd the problem is that I don't find myself easily attracted to members of the opposite sex - I prefer personality over looks any day and while this girl isn't exactly Megan Fox or Taylor Swift gorgeous, she's got a personality that leaves me hopelessly attracted.\nTL;DR:"}

I told him that I didn't want to continue it, since I knew that she wasn't someone I wanted to be with for life.\n\nHe then gave me the advice that I shouldn't think too much of the future and have fun, see where things lead. I thought this was sound advice so I took it.

This means I have to disappoint her which I really dislike.\n\nSo my question is, should I follow my friend's advice and just have fun and end up in these situations, or should I follow my instincts and stay single until I find someone that fits me, and risk never finding anyone?\nTL;DR:"}

I honestly didn't know and offered to fill a new form out with the correct times. He said it was too late and that he had to let me go. He said the reason was because that I had stolen from the company. Not a physical product, but time. No warnings, and no prior write ups. My attendance was perfect. Never late, never called in sick.\nI had an interview a few months ago and this came up. I told the truth and the interviewer grilled me and didn't believe that it was an honest mistake.

Earlier in the month I had met Stefan and when Aaron and I met, we sort of had a thing.   Anyways.  Stefan and I weren't dating yet, and I didn't know if we were going to or not.  \n\nAaron liked me and was trying to pursue me.  I said no at the time due to age (I thought it was kind of a lot at the time) and ended up choosing Stefan.  Aaron and I continued being friends and he was there for me through everything.  Through the hardships Stefan and I faced, etc.    He's been a fantastic friend and has been nothing but loyal.  \n\nSince Aaron had feelings for me at one point, Stefan didn't really like him and always had a sense of hatred towards him and was always very leary of him.   Eventually, after Stefan and I broke up, they mended their friendship and are now actually friends.\n \nNow Aaron and I are dating.  Which leads to last night.  I found out that Stefan is here in town (He goes to school in TC, Michigan) and asked Aaron to hangout yesterday.  I feel so sick to my stomach.  Aaron and I talked about it and he knows how upset I am over it. He didn't hangout with him and he said he wasn't going to.  I hate that they're friends and I feel selfish. \n\nIs it wrong of me to not want them to be friends? Keep in mind, this is someone that emotionally abused me and gaslighted me.

I already have a healthcare-related job lined up and he and I are currently looking at places to live. \n\n**Problem:** I informed my parents about this plan and they were not happy that I was moving in with him since they are relatively traditional and against pre-marital cohabitation (as well as the fact that I'll be earning under 20/hour).\nIn fact, my dad told me that once I step out of the door, I will be cut off from my family. In my parents' eyes, I am basically throwing my life away to be with a guy \"who only wants to be with me because he's lonely\" and that I'll never go to med school now.

Instead of going inside, I sneaked into the back of my mom's SUV and hid in the back under some blankets.\n\nSo, my dad went inside and acted totally normal, like nothing was going on. After about 15 or 20 minutes my mom asked my dad where I was. He replied that I was still at the DMV; he had left because the line was so long that he left while I was still waiting in it.\n \nBy this time our appointment for the DMV had passed two hours ago. My mom was freaking out, and she called me. I answered the phone while still in the back of the car and yelled at her to come pick me up. I told her that I had just reached the front of the line that I had been standing in for two hours, and they wouldn't let me get my permit because I didn't have the social security card.\n\nMy mom felt like shit, and left the house in a hurry to pick me up.

We have watched tv in his bed, and we were under the same blanket but he didn't initiate and I didn't initiate because I'm scared.\n\nBut he IS really really busy. He works daily because right now his lab is understaffed. Sometimes he doesn't get home until 9 pm. \n\nI really really really like this dude. I haven't liked a guy like this way in quite awhile.

I told her I can't believe she'd risk her job (and reputation) over viewing a site like that.  She says it's not any of my business and this is why she didn't tell me in the first place, because I'm \"too liberal.\"\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [27F] with my new boyfriend [31 M] of 4 months, He's married and I'm okay with it. Am I being na\u00efve?\nPOST: Towards the end of last year, I met a wonderful man and we've really hit it off. I haven't ever been a part of a relationship where I've fallen so hard so quickly. We spend tons of time together and laugh constantly. We also have wonderful chemistry and he was very patient with me when we first were dating and I wanted to wait before becoming physically intimate. \n\nThe only problem is that he's technically married. The story is that he was born and went to school in in Aberdeen, Scotland. About 3 years ago his company decided to move him here and he wanted his girlfriend at the time to come with him. The company wouldn't move her as well unless they were married so they went and had a quickie courthouse wedding without even having any family there. Then about a year ago they split up, she moved out of the house and they both started seeing other people. He told me about it all on our first date and it made sense to me at the time. He told me that even though they're living completely separate lives, they won't ever get divorced because his company sponsored his green card but she doesn't have one. So if they got divorced she would have to move back to Scotland where there aren't many available jobs or she could stay here but not be able to work. At first I didn't see the point in worrying about this because I barely knew the guy and had no idea where things would go but the more invested I get in him and our relationship the more it does bother me. Am I wasting my time with a man when I know that I may not ever be able to be his wife? Is there another solution to this situation that doesn't hurt anyone that I'm not seeing? I think that he should tell her she needs to apply for her own green card but would I sound jealous and controlling if I suggest that? I'm a bit conservative and don't believe in co-habitation before marriage so without this issue resolved I'm not sure how our relationship could progress. Any advice is appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

It's as bad as it gets in that department.  We didn't even consummate the day we were married, or even that month or longer.  Maybe once per year since then.  There is no passion, and when I ask about it, it gets ugly.  She refuses, acts like it's a huge inconvenience...doesn't show desire.  Forces me to 'plan' it and give her notice.  \n\nSo, on to my question.  She says it is because she wasn't raised with affection so for her, being cold is normal.  It's just the way she is, she says.   There was a time when we were wild in bed, so this isn't entirely true in my opinion.\n\nIs this a legitimate reason for her to deny me?  Lately, I have been getting in insane shape and I want to be intimate.  I find myself seriously considering cheating, and divorce.  I need someone to show me affection, and I can't be married to someone who refuses to understand my needs...\n\nAm I being fair?    I should probably say that I have become less and less attracted to her as time goes on.  She is letting herself go a little, plus it's hard to feel attracted to someone who doesn't reciprocate, for me anyway.\nTL;DR:"}

He forgave me, but I never forgave myself and I should have never gotten back together with him, I deeply regret it. He eventually broke up with me.\n\nProblem Currently:\n\nIt has been a little over a year since our final break up. It has been very hard. At one point he tried too rekindle a friendship with me and invited me to his birthday party. That night he was very drunk and told me something along the lines that he believed some sort of fate\\destiny would bring us together. After that night he denied saying that or blamed it on his inebriation. Anyways, I tried to go as no contact as possible with him after that night.\n\nBut... it seems fate will bring us together, as we are going to the same graduate school. My worry is that being in a fairly small class, we will sorta be forced into seeing one another and hanging out. Should I just lurk in the shadows and be anti-social so I can still avoid him? This might be better for my studies and he was always more outgoing than me. I don't know, I just still feel so incredibly guilty and I feel guilty that he will have to see me for five to six or so more years of his life. Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [27f] am struggling to deal with being second-rate to family, partner [29m] and friends.\nPOST: This will probably seem childish and petty to some but I am struggling to deal with the fact that the people I care about always care about someone else more than myself and I am never first priority to anyone. My family have always put partners before family, even if they have only been with their partner less than a year, whereas my own partner of 4 years puts family before partner (i.e. me), leaving me second-rate to both parties.\n\nThis is an issue that I keep thinking I have learned to overlook but the truth is that it keeps coming back to make me feel unimportant and inferior to others. I get told that love for family, partners and friends are all different kinds of love and can't be compared but I reject the idea that you can't measure which of these types of love is stronger on a personal level.\n\nI have started to resent the fact that I try very hard to please my SO (we live together) in comparison to his family yet he always places higher value on them due to the fact they are related which I see as being out of total circumstance. For example, his sister [26f], until finally getting a full-time job recently, sponged off of him for years whereas I have been helping him with money for months, something she has never done for him. He does a lot for me too but in general has a lot more sympathy and patience for his family.\n\nI am at a point where I feel like I must be a shitty person for no one to consider me their first priority and that I shouldn't continue confiding in my SO or friends about issues I am dealing with (ongoing anxiety, relationship issues with parents) because my problems will be considered small fry in comparison to the people they care more about.\n\nThe only thing I can think to compare it to is having a best friend who doesn't consider you their own best friend and the feelings of inferiority and resentment that then go with that.\n\nTo anyone else who has ever felt this way, my question is how do you learn to deal with never being first priority? I would massively appreciate any advice that will help me to move past this.\nTL;DR:"}

I've got roughly 24-30 credit hours left before I can graduate (including some clinical experience). This will probably take me at least another year to achieve as I also work a part time job.\n\nNow this doesn't sound too bad I guess but I worry that i'm getting to old to be living with my parents. Frankly, I just want to be done so I can finally start my career. I'm not expecting to find a job right away but I would at least like to be able to work a better job than my current one. This way I could afford to finally move out of my parents house. I just think it would be really healthy for me at this point. On the plus side they're paying for my tuition but on the downside they won't let me live outside of the house until I finish school or else they'll stop paying. I could get a loan but I've heard some horror stories and it just doesn't sound appealing.\n\nAnybody else out there in a similar situation?

Over the week I my weight dropped 6lbs then the next weekend came up and I kinda cheated again unexpectedly on sunday and gained 5lbs after that day. And as of now I'm down 3lbs So over the course of two weeks im at a net gain of 5lbs. It might be water weight but that seems like a long time to hold on to it and the only time I had a lot of sodium was at the wedding that sunday cheat was mostly baked goods (cookies). To me it just seems like 2 days seemingly ruined 2 weeks of progress, I doubt I even ate over 1000+ my maintenance on each day. I usually run a 700 calorie daily deficit so over 2 weeks it should have been like a 9800 caloric deficit and with the cheating in account my 2 week deficit should be like 6400 caloric deficit (1.7ish lb loss). But it seems like my weight average is around 204 now (my actual weight is 206) and before all this it was around 201. Is it possible to gain 3lbs of fat in just 2 weekends while still on a deficit during the week? (I doubt I could gain 5lbs of fat, it must be water weight)\nTL;DR:"}

(Start at 3:07 to understand get directly to the problem: markets with asymmetric information.)\n\n**Long Story:** I went on a few dates a guy working in payroll for a large insurance firm. I had just received an offer after being unemployed for a few months how frustrating it was negotiating my salary with my current employer. He smiled knowingly and shared with me some of the practices large companies like the one he worked for do to artificially hold wages down while staying legal according to the Sherman Antitrust Act. Basically, all large companies apply to receive a \"newsletter\" from an industry consulting group. This consulting group gets access to the salary information of all its subscribers. That consulting group then publishes all its data to all the companies that subscribe. It breaks down all the data by experience levels in each position type. In other words, when they look at salaries and raises businesses get all the information on industry figures but employees know none of it. I am now about to go into my yearly review. I like my job and I'm thankful to be working. However, not having the same information as my employer is frustrating. I'm wondering if there's a way to get my hands on data so I can better negotiate a pay raise.\n\n**Specific questions**\n\n1) Does anybody work for one of these industry consulting groups or payroll offices? Can you share your experience? (I haven't seen any of these reports on wages in the industry myself.)\n\n2) It seems like industry data should be public or accessible in some way.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: My weight-loss journey so far has been like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube\nPOST: I've recently realized that my journey to a healthy weight has been a lot like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube. Whenever I try different approaches to get there, it seems some aspects just don't line up and I have to backtrack and try a different approach/combination of things. Here is my story:\n\nMy journey to lose weight/become healthy started about 3-4 years ago when I decided I wanted to look better for my wedding. At that time, I jumped on board the Herbalife bandwagon and ended up losing quite a bit of weight. This was through 2 shakes a day and a \"healthy\" dinner. Shortly after the wedding, I stopped with the shakes and gained all the weight back, and then some. \n\nI let myself go for about another year or so until I saw a picture of myself from November of 2014 at my heaviest (~215) and decided that enough is enough. Starting in January of 2015 I got a gym membership and became really active with cardio. I didn't change my eating habits at all so I really wasn't losing any weight/fat. \n\nAbout May of 2015 I found this subreddit and decided to start counting calories and nix the exercise for awhile. Lost some weight, but didn't quite have the progress I was hoping for. Added in more exercise later that summer and FINALLY saw some progress!\n\nA few months later, life happened and I wasn't able to really count calories or exercise so my weight loss stalled. A few months later life reversed itself and I was able to try again. \n\nThis time I chose to start on a really low-carb diet and go easy on the exercise. Saw some really great results the first couple of weeks but quickly realized that it was unsustainable for a long period of time so eased up on the strict carb-restriction. \n\nCurrently, I'm fully invested in C25K and strength training but haven't been as diligent on the calorie counting as I should be. For some reason, I just can't get all of the pieces to fit together at the same time. But like a real Rubik's Cube, it will take me awhile to fully solve the weight-loss puzzle, but when I do it's going to feel amazing!!\nTL;DR:"}

Let me kick it off.\n\nIt was just weeks into my junior year of high school. In Spanish class I sat right behind this girl, let's call her Trouble. Me and Trouble have a strictly platonic relationship, although her boyfriend felt otherwise. Words were said about me to Trouble who then, playing the role of the instigator, relayed this message to me. Full of psuedo-machismo and bravado I speak to her boyfriend and arrange to meet outside of school grounds the next day. The next day after school a good 75-100 people are gathered at the park where the slobberknocker is to occur. I'm the last person to arrive to my own fight and tensions are running high. We stand face to face (I was approximately 5'9\" 120 lbs. at the time, he was about 5'0\" 120 lbs.) and he attempts to throw the first punch. I dodge this and we start scrapping. There was a mutual friend that sort of stood as a referee of sorts (stand the fight back up when it went to the pavement, stop anyone from getting brutalized, thwart bystanders from jumping in). We stand and bang for a good while and it's for the most part neck and neck. Towards the end of the fight I'm hitting him and although he's still standing he's not returning fire, So with one hand clenched on his shirt to keep him steady and center I throw about 4-5 straight lefts and prepare to set him down and walk away victorious. Things didn't go as planned. Everything went black and in a flash I was picking myself up off of the cement (with the help of a friend). When I asked what happened a few girls present just instructed me to get in my car and take off. I oblige and later on find out that one kid jumped in hit me square in the mouth while another came in and threw a few body shots. The kid who popped me in the face quickly jumped out, got in his car, and took off. The other kid was hit by one of my friends, who was then quickly hit by another person.

I've talked to my neurologist and he said that I still have weight to lose so I am okay. Wtf. I don't want this to get serious. Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

I am not from the area, originally, so thats the best way for me to meet a room mate. \n\nI have had great luck with craigslist room mates before, actually. One of them still remains one of my closest friends. This recent one? Not so much. So, it has me a little cautious on how to screen the next ones.

I missed the mark on the last one. \n\nSo..\n\nLeads me to my questions, as I am starting my craigslist search again:\n\nHere is what I would consider to be a good candidate: \nnon drug user\nfull time job\neducated\nminimal drinking\ndoesn't bring the party home\nideally late 20's - early 30's. \nNo drama\ngo with the flow kind of person\nresponsible (pays on time, takes care of their shit)\n\nI feel like its easy to meet someone, lie to them, and tell them everything / anything I want to hear. \n\n**What are some good questions/ Indicators I can look for to let me know whether someone is a legit candidate or just another fly by night flake?\nTL;DR:"}

I've never ever been separated with them but I can't help but feel angry and hurt that they're deciding to do this. Now this whole neighbourhood/city is going to make me feel depressed and nostalgic.

We moved in together about 6 months ago. He's great. Perfect, in fact! I couldn't be happier with this man.\n\nHere's the issue: I get extremely emotional and high strung at times, especially when it comes to a change of plans. If we have plans to do something and he has to cancel or alter them in some way, I completely lose it. Rationally, I know it's not a big deal. But somehow, all that goes out the window and my emotions take over. \n\nFor example, we had planned to go to dinner tonight. This morning he got invited to something that would be really helpful in the midst of his search for a new job. Rationally, I'm super excited for him and us going to dinner is not nearly as important. But somehow, I also felt myself tearing up in sadness because our plans got cancelled! The thing is, I'm not actually sad or upset. The emotional outburst following a change of plans is more like a knee-jerk reaction at this point.\n\nAlso, a few months ago my SO brought up that I was not giving him enough space and making him feel guilty for every time he wanted to do something without me. I took steps to make sure that I wasn't doing that because I do want him to have his space, as I want to have mine. \n\nHow can I change my behavior?

I have known this girl for about 5 years now and we have always been pretty good friends, always hung out with the same group of people and all that sort of stuff. She went to college in another state and had a boyfriend for about 3 years and they had a nasty breakup within the last year.She came home for summer and we hung out for a bit, as friends do, before she left the country.\n\nWhile she has been away we have talked some, but not too terribly much. Suddenly a few nights ago she sends me a message saying that I was in a dream she had. Naturally I ask her what the dream was about. She tells me that its indecent. Thinking it to be something humorous, she was always dirty in a funny suggestive way, never explicit, I tell her it wouldn't be the first time she's said something indecent to me. She then proceeds to tell me that she was giving me a blow job in her dream. \n\nI was a bit confused and taken off guard by this. I had told her previously that I had had a crush on her in hs but not really now. We then talked for a bit more, I said that I wouldn't mind having her, relations and all that, and she gave me the \"you could get a so much more attractive gal\" thing. She then also talked about basically going to a party that was much like an orgy where she was and how she didn't do anything. She then went on to say how she didn't sleep around but if she was really drunk might have at one point slept with someone she knew and was close to. All in all the conversation confused me and I'm not sure how to take it. I just need some interpretation and advice.\nTL;DR:"}

To provide a bit of backstory, I am in a new city(been here a year and a half), with no friends, waitressing/in my first semester of college and he is graduated and working a big kid/40 hr per week job, so there are a few lifestyle differences. I have felt in the past that he is not as open about certain things as I would like such as past relationships. He has a policy that he prefers not to speak of them at all.\n\nI respected this decision, but tonight I was up late and on his computer. I had a moment of insanity and saw his gmail open so I decided to read his conversations with him and a long-time female friend whom he had previously told me he had never been involved with. It was an invasion of his privacy in entirety. But while I was reading, I saw that he and her referenced that they had dated some years(5) back. They still say \"I love you\"(which I knew but he told me not to worry about), and at the beginning of our relationship, he would describe our sexual experiences in full to her, and she would do the same of her and her SO. It all seemed pretty platonic besides that, but I can't help but feel hurt. I should not have looked through his messages, and am going to tell him about it.\n\nI've had far less relationships and sexual partners than him and this has brought to light insecurities/jealousies in me. I thought we had a healthy relationship, but I'm starting to see little pitfalls in our openness with each other. I'm lying here next to him considering ending it, because maybe I'm just not mature enough for this sort of relationship. \n\nYet the fact remains, I love him more than anyone I have ever loved, we have incredible sex, I feel magnetically drawn to him, he is supportive, understanding, and kind, and an all around amazing human being who I have a lot in common with. Advice from those with more experience? Feeling pretty damn sad and alone right now.\nTL;DR:"}

We drunkenly hooked up one night at a party. I was a virgin. I don't remember exactly how the first time went, because I was (we were both) very intoxicated.  When I sobered up a little bit, we proceeded to have sex again that same night, and we've been hooking up casually roughly a year since. \n\nI have dated someone else before, but we only had oral sex but no actual intercourse. \n\nI have developed feelings for this guy I'm hooking up with, and he knows because I've told him few months back. He told me he doesn't want a relationship right now, and I said I understand. Since then, we are still hanging out. We'd watch a movie and get a meal together etc, before sex. \n\nMy question is, should I tell him I was a virgin when we started having sex? I haven't because I don't want him to think of it as a manipulation tactic to pressure him to date me, and it really isn't. If he doesn't want a relationship, this isn't going to change how he feels. On the other hand, I feel like I should be honest about it. I almost feel like I'm hiding something not disclosing this information? The topic never came up between us of course.

Last year I applied to a bunch of colleges, ended up choosing one and paying all the deposits, reserved a spot on the dorms, etc...\n\nFor personal reasons I was not able to attend college, so I let them know by email that I would not be attending, and my admission and scholarship were both cancelled. I assumed this would cut all ties with the school. By the way, I did this back in July, before classes or orientation began, so I never even touched school grounds.\n\nThe $250 charge comes from a \"no show fee\" from the residential deparment. They say that because I didn't let them know specifically that I wouldn't be attending I have to pay this fee, despite the fact that other departments had no problem with it.\n\nI'm very reluctant to pay this fee. I already had paid a deposit for the room, and it feels stupid to me that I'm being charged because I didn't email every single department in the school separately. I've tried to get them to drop the charge, but they won't. \n\nSo now I'm wondering if anything would happen if I just didn't pay it. I have no plans to attend, or have any interaction with this college whatsoever. I never attended or enrolled, so they can't put a hold on anything.\n\nIf I don't pay, will this keep me from getting into a different college? Will the debt come back to bite me in the ass? Can they pursue it legally or something?\n\nI guess, what's the worst case scenario here?\n\nI figure best case scenario they just don't care and I go on living life normally forever. But I'm worried that this debt might keep me from graduating at another college or something. Does anyone have any experience with things like this?\nTL;DR:"}

If I bring up his relationship with his ex, he says he couldn't be himself with her and act silly like he can with me.

As such, I can't fully close my left eye \u2013 I can only get it into a sort of half-lidded state. When I want to sleep, I have to wear an eyepatch so that I can \"close\" my left eye.\n\nAnyway, so I woke up about 45 minutes ago, and flipped up my eyepatch so I could see from both eyes. The sight I was greeted by was a rather large spider crawling along the ceiling above my bed. Realizing that I did not want that spider in my bedroom, my sleep- and medicine-addled brain decided it would be a good idea to grab the nearest object and whip it as hard as I could at the spider.\n\nThankfully, that object was not a glass or a knife or something else similarly destructive. Instead, it was an empty plastic soda bottle. Miraculously, I also didn't miss the spider, and managed to hit it at such an angle that it was knocked from my ceiling. \n\nUnfortunately for me, the spider wasn't just gone \u2013 it had to fall to somewhere. That somewhere happened to be what was straight below the spider, which was my paralyzed-open eye.\n\nOne string of swears and seven tissues filled with spider parts later, I recognize my chances of falling asleep again are basically zero and my chances of getting an eye infection have skyrocketed. My immediate next thought was that this would make an amazing story for r/TIFU.\nTL;DR:"}

I totally blame those 18 year old hotties for my delayed reaction.\n\nAfter covering my hand in piss as well, I made a quick mid-shit clean up as I stood with my cheeks carefully spread as to not create extra unnecessary mess.

I pulled all three mostly because I was trying to identify any negative items.  Two of the three reports have a 'public record' which is a ~$400 judgement against me from something from years back I don't even remember what it was from.  There is no account related to this, only this 'public record' that is scheduled to fall off in about a year, November 2014.  All my student loans are in good standing.  I am making payments of approx $450/month and I'm making the full payment amounts. No extra, no income based payments, etc.\n\nThe only other thing on the reports is a paid car loan from circa 2005 that seems to be closed in good standing, and a closed credit card from that same time period that is closed and doesn't appear to be negative although it lists the credit limit as $500 and has a high balance listed as over $1000 so obviously it wasn't always a smooth ride.  \n\nThere's literally nothing else on there.  I signed up at credit karma and it showed [this]  A bit better than I was expecting I suppose.\n\nSo I'm looking for some guidance as to what to do about the public record judgement, whether or not to apply for a credit card (and what kind of application or card to go after), how to game plan for acquiring a vehicle, and how to start to improve my credit long term.\nTL;DR:"}

Then proceeds to complain to me that the cat wont cuddle with her... \n\nI convince her to cuddle with me in bed and say I'll leave in 30mins. We cuddle for like 50mins because I fell asleep. Then I'm like, since Im staying the night later anyway can I just chill here? And she says no because she has to \"clean her room\" and I would be \"in the way\". \n\nSo I leave and later get the text that she doesnt want me to come over and spend the night because she saw me Thursday night until Friday evening and now that day for lunch (which again I on a whim went across the city to have with her). And apparently that was too much time together. Then I guess that night she decided to finally end things.\nTL;DR:"}

The dog is awesome and has no behavioral issues save for how he's super cute and he knows it. The cats, on the other hand, are another story.\n\nThe eldest cat, Sable is declawed, aloof, and was an only cat for some time before the other two came along. Next in line is Dog (the cat). She was a rescue from off the street and had kittens soon after we took her in to our home. The third cat is one of these kittens. She's over a year old now and aptly named Lemonade. \n\nLemonade likes to make lemonade on the couch, on the carpet, in the sink, etc. At first we thought her marking was in response to moving into Sable's territory. We kept Dog & Lemonade away from Sable for close to six months - each area with its own food, water, and liter box, with D & L having access to outside as well. Once we stopped the quarantine, the marking stopped. But we have recently noticed it has started again.\n\nWe use Nature's Miracle when we notice the markings, but it doesn't seem to help. I'm currently in the middle of shampooing the entire house. And, yes, I know commercial shampooers don't really do the trick, but I'm starting to get really embarrassed by the smell and appearance of our carpets and it's all I can think to do!\n\nI've thought about surrendering Lemonade to the local area's humane society (she also has a big problem with bringing in and mutilating small animals inside), but when I see the cats currently up for adoption there, I get so sad! There are so many cats in the system already. And the fact my cats have a home makes me feel horrible for thinking I should get rid of them.\n\nI am becoming a jaded pet owner! If you have any similar stories, advice, or words on encouragement, please send them this way. I need a pep talk!\nTL;DR:"}

This is all possible because her current boyfriend lives 45 minutes away and he's going to be attending a college thats 300+ miles away, while me and her are going to the same school. She tells me she loves me and that shes confused and she wants to try ldr with her bf in college before she makes any decisions. Even though she cheated, I still think shes worth waiting for. Lately shes been having stomach aches and today she told me she felt dizzy after standing up too fast and she fell asleep randomly today. She had safe sex with her bf a couple weeks ago so there is a chance shes pregnant but she doesn't want to take a test. I know if I try hard enough she'll choose me in college but if she is pregnant, even if she gets an abortion idk if I can be with her knowing that. Any suggestions on what to do in the mean time? Her period is supposed to come in a week I believe. How can i win her over in college if she isn't pregnant?\nTL;DR:"}

He was informed when he got there that she had died three months ago. He was her only next-of-kin, and they've previously contacted him for incidents such as bumps, bruises, or accidents, so they definitely have his contact information.\n\nMy step father is a very religious man, and not being able to give his grandmother a funeral or even say goodbye is likely going to cause him a great deal of distress.\n\nWhat can/should he do in this situation?\n\nOk, so I'm here for an update on this. \n\nFirst, I live in California, I'm visiting my family for the holidays.\n\nSecond, my stepdad is about 50, and falls asleep at the wheel on long drives unless someone goes with him - necessitating that at least two people take a day trip to visit his grandmother. \n\nThird, whoever mentioned it was correct; she was not able to use a telephone. She was slipping for a while, and we're not sure she'd have even understood that a voice out of a telephone was a person.\n\nFinally, everything was resolved. It turns out that when the paperwork was originally filled out, my stepdad WAS listed as the person to contact in case of bumps, bruises, or anything like that, but it had an entirely different different place to put \"In Case of Death, Call:\" and when she checked in years ago, due to either personal error or just to have someone closer to her, a friend of hers that lived nearby and is similarly old, was listed in that spot. The friend was called when she died and informed, so they assumed she'd let everyone else know that needed to.\nTL;DR:"}

If this is the wrong sub, please let me know.\n\nI've taking Sertraline aka Zoloft for about a week now for depression and anxiety (worried my anxiety may have a role in this). I was getting over a minor cold when I started taking it. After a couple days certain spots began to become really itchy, it was mostly my ankles and ribs. I got really bothered by this, looked up side effects and found that it can be a rare side effect associated with Sertraline. The itches are gone now.\n\nNow this is where I think my anxiety might be fucking me over. When I received my prescription I thoroughly read through the health information. Reading about serotonin syndrome really freaked me out. Last night I started feeling things that were included in the warning about serotonin syndrome. Yesterday I started feeling really sick. My eyes started to ache, I was beginning to feel a sore throat, my entire body felt very achy. I also took my temperature because I was convinced I have a fever too. It was about 102 degrees. I took a very hot bath about 30-60 minutes before that and I have no idea if that would effect it or not. My mother also said your temperature rises during the evening?\n\nPart of the reason I'm concerned is because I had just gotten over a cold and it doesn't seem likely that I would get another one so soon. As for now, I'm not going to continue taking the medication.

We've known each other longer. We've travelled together, been in tight places, and been wonderful together for a long while. \n\nBecause housing is very expensive where we are, and we are students, we moved in with my sister and have been sharing a space for the school year. It's put a lot of strain on my partner and my relationship, especially since my sister doesn't treat him well: I have trouble standing up to her when she's cruel because I've grown up with her and learned not to react to her moods, but I do my best. I don't know how far I should go standing up to her and how much needs to come from him. It's obvious we should move out, but we don't have the money yet. \n\nRecently, it's been impossible to talk to him without arguing, and I've been getting very stressed out, unhappy and not myself. He isn't willing to deal with me being difficult on top of his concerns: school, money and my sister's contrariness - the latter of which he is beginning to project onto me. Even small discussions becoming passive aggressive and it's destroying my sense of self and impacting my schoolwork. I don't know how much of the problem is between us and how much of it is a result of our proximity to my sister. I am worried that us moving out together again won't be a magic cure-all. \n\nHe is a very headstrong person, and outspoken, and fiery. I am very laid back, but certain of my own convictions. I find it difficult to speak my mind accurately and well when I am frustrated, so I tend to turn off, and this only serves to make him angrier. I feel that what I say will be inevitably wrong, or will make things worse - and when I do speak this proves fairly accurate. It is becoming difficult to reconcile our opinions and still more difficult for us to explain ourselves because everything turns into an argument. Our libidos are low and it is particularly hard to find a point of reference with each other without intimacy. \n\nIf anyone has any insight, I would be grateful.\nTL;DR:"}

I stood by him when he had a drug addiction. Before I cheated on him that night, I had begun to suspect that he was being unfaithful to me (there was one flirtatious FB message he sent to a girl, and his attitude toward me had become distant. He started to take me for granted, I think. Not to mention we lived an hour & a half apart from each other). I was feeling super insecure.

So now I'm pretty much trying to convince her to have sex with me because I'm ready and willing and not because she doesn't think I am.\nTL;DR:"}

That guy and I got along pretty well, we were seeing each other for a few months but I wanted us to be exclusive so we could have sex and he said no so we stopped hanging out after that. Anyways I haven't dated anybody since then, but I've recently met this guy I really like and I want to ask him out or something, but I keep thinking back to something the other guy said.\n\nBasically, one night when we were cuddling and making out, he let slip that he could \"tell\" that I wasn't a very experienced kisser based on the way I kissed... when I got worried he tried to reassure me that it wasn't a bad thing, my kissing was just different somehow. At the time I was a little freaked out by that comment and got very self-conscious, so that almost every time we kissed after that I would wonder \"was this what he meant? was that what he meant?\" We broke up pretty soon after that anyway. \n\nSo I really really don't want this new guy I like (or any guy) to think I'm inexperienced. I like to feel confident when I hook up with a guy, and if he thought I didn't know what I was doing I would feel awkward. I still have no idea what the other guy meant... if it was one specific thing I could change it, but I just don't know. Any suggestions here?\nTL;DR:"}

Haven't had sex yet because he's inexperienced and wants to be cautious about moving in that direction because he felt like it can be a distraction from getting to know eachother. He lives in a house with four other dudes all in their early 20s. \n\nI on the other hand, crazy liberal and love sex but had to move back to my parents' after college. \n\nHe's not what I would have picked out for myself, him being sort of a conservative Christian, but he makes me happy and laugh till I'm tearing up and we get along pretty damn well. \n\nThe problem is, it's starting to feel like things are heating up but despite being two full grown adults, we can never be alone in a normal setting. Sure we can fool around in the back of his car, but it's getting cramped and old. I can bring him home with me and get nasty in my childhood bedroom while my parents watch tv downstairs, which I'm not above doing but is definitely making things awkward. \n\nHis place however is completely off the table. Allegedly the roommates have a deal where they can't have girls in their room with the door closed (found that out after the fact) and now I find out (again after the fact) that he can't even have me there in the house if a third party isn't present. Is this a normal thing among grown men? I'm sort of incredulous about the whole idea. \n\nAlso his roommates have never been particularly warm towards me (never been a problem with exes) and rarely talk to me or really acknowledge my attempts at conversations. I have no fucking clue what the problem is, some of these guys have girlfriends too, so it's not like their monks.\nTL;DR:"}

How to ease the pain?\nPOST: This is kind of an update from [another post] Long story short is that we were having problems, broke up briefly and then got back together several months ago after being together for almost 2 years. Except once we got back together, he had to keep it a secret from his parents. They hate me for ending it in the first place and hurting him, even though he forgave me.\n\nI can see where they're coming from, but I think it's not their place to dictate who their adult son is dating. I'm not some deviant, I have a full-time job and my own place and I think I do pretty well for myself.\n\nThey pay for his tuition, food and housing, and were also threatening that if he stayed together with me, he would not be allowed to see any part of his family or stay in their house at all. So really it was not much of a choice, since his family is very important to him and family is a huge part of their culture.\n\nIn short I'll say that he has been a really good SO - pushed me to be my best self, always there for me, and helping with my pet, kind, funny, gentle, basically everything I ever wanted in a partner.\n\nWe still love each other and had a tearful goodbye today. We agreed it was best not to talk or anything. It's very hurtful to go through a breakup neither of us want. How do I move past the pain? I know it just takes time but we said goodbye just today and I already miss him so much. Every few minutes I think of something interesting or funny and I want to tell him or talk and then I remember that we can never see each other again.\nTL;DR:"}

Also, I don't know if this is related and I feel weird talking about it, but last night when he got home at 2am he stayed up watching porn and masturbating for literally 3 hours. I don't know why but it kind of freaked me out, and it felt like a wakeup call that something is wrong. It just seemed so strange and compulsive to me.\n\nWe haven't been fighting, and he is generally a good husband. If I ask him to take out the trash or pick up dinner he always does without complaining. But I feel like something weird is going on with him, and he doesn't talk to me. He isn't really a \"feelings\" guy. \n\nI've asked him to do a couple date nights, just the two of us, but he often will end up inviting one of his buddies along, or if it's just the two of us, I try to talk to him and mostly we sit in silence. And after dinner he goes out with his friends.\n\nNothing is really terribly wrong, but I just have this feeling like he is really pulling away from me, and I know I can't force him to open up to me.

My husband hates his job, and it is really dragging him down.\n\nFirst of all--he can't quit without MAJOR repercussions (Military). He no doubt has physical and emotional damage, and absolutely wants out. It started after his first deployment began in early 2011 (but had already reenlisted), so his contract isn't up until December of next year. \n\nThere is a myriad of everyday things that have him fed up, and the demanding nature of the job that he hates just gets to him. To top it all off, he is stationed overseas and hasn't seen him immediate family or any friends in almost two years.\n\nHe has become withdrawn in the sense that he only wants to relax when he is home, and can't even think of anything to do that would make him happy. He plays his video games, we definitely make time for intimacy, and our relationship is good (minus some of my insecurities that arise from hormones and/or his apathy). I know that I am all he has to lean on, so I snap out of it as soon as possible (never longer than a 30 minute period) and remember how important it is for me to lift his spirits. But I can't get him to engage in what I think would be fun for him.\n\nHe loves winter sports, but when I tried to plan something for christmas time he shot me down claiming it's too expensive. I plan on dragging him anyway, because we are financially secure (but very frugal) and he of all people needs to let loose and have fun. I've noticed on the last few trips we've taken that he becomes unhappy when the tiniest problems arise. It is just obvious that he can't have fun, and I know that is a sign of oncoming/present depression.\n\nWhat can I do to help him enjoy life again?\nTL;DR:"}

She struggles with numerous mental health issues, and throughout her entire life I am one of the only aspects that's positive for her.\nThirdly, I want the experience and learning curve. I know a lot about living alone and would be capable of it, but I want to learn first hand how to pay rent and taxes and manage my finances. I think this is a great and affordable oppurtunity to do so.\nThere are many other reasons, my home environment is quite toxic due to my poor relationship with my step father and step sister. \n\nThe problem is, I'm really desperate to move out and see no other way of going about it. I'm just finding it really hard to  bring myself to leave my mother behind with my step father and step sister. The issue is I would be going to university shortly anyway if I hadn't chosen to defer. This means that mum needs to be able to get used to the idea eventually either way, but for her it is better later rather than sooner. She will be devastated for a long time and will fail to understand. If I tell her the reasonable reasons why I want to move and how sure I am it is affordable (I have calculated it all) do you think she will understand?\nI am 100% certain this is what i want and is good for me, but not for her.

He takes back what he said, says okay I believe you, but it came up again yesterday so clearly he's not getting it.\n\nI have been taking the pills continuously so I can skip my periods since before I met him, so he hasn't ever been able to see me off them and see for himself I'm exactly the same person. I can practically see the train of thought going through his head as ex girlfriend not on BC --> she was crazy --> this gf on BC --> must be why she isn't crazy. \n\nIt bothers me in 2 ways. Firstly I think it's just plain offensive to girls in general to think that we are all irrational hormonal bitches if not otherwise controlled. Secondly, it's offensive it's to me personally because we are in a serious relationship and he should freaking know me better than to think I'll go off on some crazy mood swing by now! \n\nThe last time this got brought up, maybe 6 months ago, I told him that although I would never do it (really never in a million years, just to make it clear), his comments made me want to stop taking them (I would tell him if I ever went off them, I don't want babies now either) so I could prove to him I'm not hiding any crazy anywhere. Our relationship is great and this is the only point of contention I have with him. How can I explain or show him that I'm not crazy because I'M NOT CRAZY, not just because I'm medicated?\nTL;DR:"}

The last and only time I have cheated on him was when I was a sophomore in high school, and him about two years ago. I thought that we had gotten past this, because since he has gone into the military he grew up (or so I had thought). \n\nI am very open to trying things sexually with him, and we have even gone as far as trying to do the whole swingers thing. He has been looking for a W4MM WM4M or W4M, which I have told him in the past that I would really want a three-some, but he always tells me that that is in the past for him, and he is not interested. \n\nLike I said, the sex has been scarce, and he has been masturbating instead of having sex with me (but I talked to him about it, and he still is doing it. I don't care about porn, but it's disrespectful to me when I have been begging for sex, and then he would rather masturbate while I'm asleep or in the other room). \n\nHow do I approach him about this?

In a recent argument, she said that i never stand up for her and that i never defend her. That hurt like a bitch but i took it in and thought about it. Im insecure, and im always afraid of speaking up. No one has ever done anything to her when im with her however, she says that in some classes a guy annoys her. I'm guessing that is what she is referring to when she says i dont stand up for her. As i said im insecure and im afraid of speaking up, but if i go talk to the guy what do i say, how do i address the situation seeing that i barely know the guy. Also people here tend to physically fight alot for stupid reasons and thats why i dont speak up much. Also a fight here is not a one on one thing its usually a guy brings his friends and the other does too. I dont have many friends and no older brothers so if it resorts to a fight i wouldnt know what to do. I just want to show my girlfriend that i love her and i truly do.\nTL;DR:"}

I won a very hefty art scholarship from the school, basically covers about half of all tuition for 4 years. Awesome, right? State is cheaper, but doesnt have anything close to what I want.\n\nProblem: During the first semester, I overloaded my schedule. I don't mind working my ass off, but I seriously underestimated the workload. I'm not a whiny 19 year old with no other life experience to compare it to - when I was in college before, I was going full time and working nearly full time (bio/fine art, dropped out because life). This was still more work and more stress than working/going to school - this college is very new, and is notorious for setting unrealistic expectations to prove its worth. \n\nANYWAY. I hurt my hand, gave myself RSI the first semester. Sore, but thought it would go away. Braced it, pushed through the next semester and it still hurt. Took the summer off from everything, used my hand an utter minimum. Thought it was healed, but starts hurting when I draw again.\n\nThis. Is. Terrifying. A sprain should heal in 6-9 weeks, not 6-9 months right? Well, I check my options. If I take a semester off, I forfeit my scholarship. Without the scholarship, I can't afford school (credit sucks, no private loans.) If I power through, Im afraid of hurting myself worse. If I hurt myself worse, Im afraid of this being career ending.\n\nI've just started seeing a physical therapist (yeah i know, but my insurance also sucks so there was a 6 mo waiting list for the hand specialist). I'm also talking to the disabilities councilor tomorrow, and will eventually go cry to the student council and department chairs. So I don't know what all my options are yet, and Ill yell and kick and scream if I have to, but the school is really bad about accommodating students. So I'm frustrated, in pain, and afraid.\n\nAdvice? Similar experience? Help?\nTL;DR:"}

I didn't discover reddit until some weeks ago so I thought of sharing this with you even if it's not a big fuck up.\n\nSo this happened in a small village in Greece where I come from. The people there all know each other and are friendly. I however don't feel that open with them because I lived in the city and wasn't there very often. \n\nHowever, one usual Sunday winter morning, I went to the church with my mom and grandma, wearing a big white fluffy jacket.\nThe thing about grandmas in that village is that they ALL look basically the same; short with short hair, black clothes and skirt to under the knees and gray hair. So when the liturgy was over, we all got out of the church and I realized I lost my mom which I later found out she was talking to other women she knew. But I also lost my grandma. \n\nI started the search for my grandma. After 5 mins of searching, I got a bit confused when I saw her talking to one of the famous families in that village (which included their son who was my crush). So I step forward in a very good mood to join their conversation since my grandma was there. I go from behind and hug, saying in a very goofy and childish way;\n\n\"Damn, I look like a big snowman in that jacket, hahaha!\"\n\nThe look that followed me after that poor old lady turn her head to see who was goofily hugging her was so embarrassing. She was not my grandma. And I had just embarrassed myself in front of my crush. They all looked at my very weirdly like I was a stupid 5 year old. \n\nWorst thing is I was totally frozen then and there that I didn't know what to do, I really became a snowman. I didn't know if I should leave without saying anything or stay and say sorry and start a small conversation. So I did what my brain thought was best; stay and not say anything looking like a total idiot.\nTL;DR:"}

He has relatively recently started snoring loudly and consistently at night. It has been a combination of drinking (even just a beer or glass of whiskey each night) and weight gain (we think?). Also, he fidgets a ton and his moving and rolling around shakes me awake. It ends up with me either getting very little, shitty sleep where I have to nudge him to stop snoring all throughout the night, or me moving to another bed or couch.\n\nWe do not live together and fortunately he has two beds and two rooms at his house, so I just sleep upstairs. When he sleeps at my place (no extra bed or room) I'm almost guaranteed to not get sleep.\n\nFor me, sleeping separately benefits me far greater than sharing a bed. Getting no sleep and being exhausted for the entire day is horrible. Unfortunately, my boyfriend is taking this situation personally, and thinks that it's destroying our intimacy and romance, and questions whether I love him anymore, complains about me sleeping in another bed, etc. It's sort of this \"how could you do this to me?\" attitude.\n\nAnyway, I would really love any suggestions from people who have either recovered from snoring a lot, or who have improved with sleeping heavier and not waking up at any sound/movement.\n\nThanks a ton.\nTL;DR:"}

I began personally paying my student loans in February 2012, my dad was handling the loan payments prior so i could focus on school but told me quite a bit late to begin handling them myself. When i began paying, it was about $26000 subsidized (5.3%,) $3000 unsub (6.8 %.)\n\nI fully paid off the unsub loan a few months ago, and have the subsidized loan down to $21000. I am currently looking to move and called my credit card to have my credit line increased (to buy furniture, pay rent electronically= easy reward points) \n\nThe increase was declined even though I'm self employed making about $140,000 annually now that I'm done with school. I need help understanding what I should do now. I plan on paying off the student loan in full Friday, will that fix the issue? I called Federal Student Loans earlier and they told me I need to write a letter explaining my situation. I will do it but it seems like a slow process. \n\nI am baffled the credit card company can see the past delinquency but not see I am no longer delinquent. All my credit cards and bills are always paid in full monthly. I'm not as concerned about the credit line increase, its the apartment applications that is worrying me because I assume they will check my credit. I can provide any needed information.\nTL;DR:"}

For those who doesn't know, NEET means 'not under education, employment, or training\". This was basically my nightmare before I graduated. I studied one semester last year but because of family reasons, I stopped. I could go into details if I am asked but the story is that my mother's cousin drove my mother to bankruptcy. My mom manages to keep us afloat though, she's a smart woman. She's good enough to keep us a decent house, internet, and the needed utilities. She just can't afford to let me continue my college education yet while she's trying to regain what she lost. The part that's killing me is that I feel like a fucking leech, a tumor clinging to her for sustenance. I want to do something, to help, I want a job but not any jobs that require social interaction. I'm agoraphobic and I can't deal with too much attention. I'm generally anti-social and I'm terrible at interactions with strangers, which is why the internet is basically my life. It took me over half a year to finally get myself to post this because it's just eating me from the inside. So I guess what I'm really asking for is advice on how to deal with this so I don't just mooch off of her forever.\nTL;DR:"}

BUT when i opened the door he shouted \"BOBA FETT\" and i couldn't help but just stand in confusion after hastily closing the door. So i just stood there for a second thinking \"Boba Fett? is this what he always says when having sex?\" or maybe that it was like a \"secret phrase\" between them or something. I actually have a huge poster of Boba Fett on my wall next to my bed (Im a huge Star Wars fan) and i wondered if he said it because he saw it and it just popped into his brain or something. When my brother gets outta my room he looks at me and says \"did you hear what i said?\" to which i replied \"yeah dude it was kinda random\" after wards he walked off awkwardly saying \" ok\". Im now alone in my house picturing situations where shouting \"BOBA FETT\" during sex would be reasonable as a way to cope with the awkwardness. Someone halp pls.\nTL;DR:"}

So, both of us suck at keeping house basically. We both ignore dishes, throw clothes everywhere, leave random junk just laying around; overall we're both just messy. Not so much dirty though, I vacuum often and it's not like food is left out, or there's physical dirt/grime.  It's just cluttered as all hell.  I think its both of us pretty equally; however, I will eventually clean up. I'll take a day and just go crazy, putting things away, organizing, doing laundry, cleaning bathrooms and taking out garbage. He won't do it unless I ask, he's not just not mindful of it. This doesn't bother me,  though, I don't mind pointing out \"hey, can you pick this up.\" \n\nBuuuuut, I'm just sick of living like this. Right now I know we have  problems with clutter because we're living in a place that is FAR too small for us and all of our stuff. We have zero storage space (not an exaggeration, we have one small closet that's packed with stuff).  We're also both balls tired after work, which is totally just an excuse I know, because cleaning isn't THAT hard, but it is a truth. I say I'll do the dishes but then once I get home I'm just done.\n\nSo, my question is how can we as a couple/team keep up the house better? Messy people who have been reformed, how did you change? Clean people who keep keep their houses like museums HOW do you did it?\nTL;DR:"}

When I'm with him, I really like him, but when I'm on my own I keep thinking about how I'd be totally fine with not ever seeing him again and my life would just go back to the way it was (which I was completely happy with and wasn't even looking for a relationship, just having fun).

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: A question about macros.\nPOST: So I've been lurking on /r/loseit, /r/leangains, and even /r/gainit for a while. My current goal is to get down to about 10% body fat and then begin to slow bulk. Currently I'm about 180 lbs and though I'm not sure what my current body fat percentage is my weight loss goal is to get down to 160. If I had to guess I'd say my body fat percentage is somewhere between 14-20%.  \n  \nSorry for the preface, I'll get right to the point. From what I understand, to maintain as much muscle as possible while on a cut it's important to eat 1g of protein per pound of your goal body weight minimum. This helps to reduce muscle loss while cutting. A simple formula I found that I really like is to eat < 10 * current body weight a day to lose weight. Obviously this is simplifying what can be a complicated formula based on your activity level and other factors, but when double checked against the calculator in the FAQ this number hits a middle ground between the weight loss number and the more rapid weight loss number so I'm going to give it a try.  \n  \nUsing this simple formula, 10 * 180lbs = 1800 cals a day. To maintain as much muscle as possible I'm going to be eating at least 160g of protein a day maybe 170g just for satiety and because meat is delicious. SO, if a single gram of protein has 4 calories that means out of my 1800 cals/day 640-680 of them are coming from protein. My question is does it make a huge difference where the other calories come from?  \n  \nI realize that getting those calories from nutrient rich foods like vegetables is ideal, but hypothetically speaking, once I hit my protein requirements for the day would I still lose weight if the remainder of my calories came from nothing but ice cream? (As long as I stayed under 1800.) Please don't take this example too seriously, it's an intentionally extreme scenario. I'm just wondering if a certain split between carbs and fat is more ideal for weight loss.\nTL;DR:"}

I was planning on visiting her like mentioned in my first post, **but everyday single day since she got back to college we would fight/argue about something.** We tried making compromises.

I decided to go back to counselling to avoid a toxic relationship with my girlfriend around the break. Despite my efforts, I think it's clear that i'm not emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship. I was on a path of being very controlling which does not benefit me or her. I woke up everyday in a state of anxiety. I don't have anything to do but talk to my girl. **I'm a fucking loser. I wasn't when I met her though, I worked full time at a nice little Italian bakery. But then came the sleepless nights when my girl decided to go clubbing. Sleepless nights meant me calling in sick, eventually resulting in me getting fired.

She has a memory that's starting to become a problem.\nPOST: Everyone forgets things. I couldn't care less about that. Although she is consistently forgetful, the real problem is that she incorrectly recalls events. \n\nFor example, yesterday we did a puzzle together. Today she mentioned how much more she thought she pieced together. I can't remember how all 500 pieces, but she went as far as to claim several things I clearly remember doing. I disagree and she gets angry. This leads to fights.\n\nDo I give a shit about a puzzle? Not at all. But this happens often. She claims chores I did, paying for things she didn't, etc. At first I would brush things off because I'd give her the benefit of the doubt since she was so certain. But I started to be more vigilant and I see the pattern. \n\nShe told me when we first started dating she had a bad memory, but with her pridefulness she doesn't admit things in the moment. I've tried to talk to her several ways and times about it. She turns it into finger pointing and a 'he said, she said' kind of fight devolves. In top of that she is adamant the her version of events on completely and infallibly correct. \n\nIt compounds into when we fight about other things. She recalls things differently. Let me admit I don't know something and everything I say is undermined. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Know a way to deal with it effectively?\nTL;DR:"}

We've met each other's friends, we tell each other our deepest secrets and ask and talk about our futures. However, he disclosed to me early on that he would be leaving the country in early March so our relationship had an expiry date. I never thought I would connect with someone on so many different levels, especially with the amount of failed relationships I've had in my past so I agreed immediately to the arrangement.\n\nSince then, although it's only been 6 months, we've grown together. He shifted his leaving date to the end of May for both work and the chance to spend my birthday with me and take me to another country for a holiday. Recently, we've also moved in together and he's been wonderful, putting in the effort to make the place we have into \"our home,\" as he put it. He's just become such a permanent and constant fixture in my life that the looming date of his departure is killing me. He constantly talks about how great his country is and is always encouraging me to visit but that could be years from now. \n\nI'm just so confused about my feelings and I'm trying to distance myself but when you spend every day together and you live together, it's just so difficult to decide what's right.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is, how do I get over his departure when he leaves and is there a reason to maintain contact with him after he leaves in hopes for a relationship in the future?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/askwomenadvice\nTITLE: How would you react to receiving a letter from an ex?\nPOST: Thanks to anyone who reads and responds.\n\nI broke up with my ex girlfriend a little over three months ago. Ultimately what led to the end of our relationship was a lack of communication. We really liked each other a lot but little issues snowballed into bigger problems and eventually things went to hell. Our sex life was non-existent for the last month and a half of our relationship and she always had an excuse whenever I tried to make plans with her. I got frustrated and broke up with her. She didn't seem to take it well. Two weeks after the break up I told her that I still liked her and I was willing to make things work. She said she still liked me but it wasn't what she wanted right now.\n\nI kept busy over the summer. I worked, travelled, and dated other people. The problem is that it's three months later and I still have feelings for her.\n\nI saw her on campus recently and I decided to text her. We mostly just made small talk but she seemed receptive and happy to talk to me. I asked her if she wanted to catch up over a cup coffee last weekend. She responded eighteen hours later saying she had to work all weekend and that she felt hesitant about meeting up. I responded by saying the invitation was open.\n\nThe point of this is, I want to send her a short two paragraph letter. I want to start out by saying that I thought about her and the good times we had together often over the summer, but I understand why she wouldn't want to meet up. The second paragraph would be an honest apology over my role in the break up and assuring her that I still cared for her.\n\nYes, I want her back. Yes, I know that I'm only setting myself up for heartbreak. But our relationship started out perfect and I can't shake the feeling that it ended prematurely. I've heard people say that the only way an old relationship can work is if the problems that led to the break up are resolved. I think that our problems can and are being resolved.\n\nI need to know for sure that it can or cannot work. I can't rest until I get some kind of closure.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been having some problems and I want to know if I deserve a second chance. \n\nThe problems began after four months of dating when she fooled around with my best friend, (He didn't know we were together). She confessed the next day. I forgave her and days later we slowly started getting into the relationship again. She joined the Air Force and we got married eight months later. We fought like any newlywed couple would, but in the back of my mind I resented her. \n\nShe got an honorable discharge and we moved back to my parents to save some money for a nice place of our own while we went to University. For the past two months that we've been back home, I've been cold towards her. When she gets me angry I would call her horrible things, things I never did before. And the past week it reached its pinnacle when I walked into the bathroom and she was naked. \n\nWhile I was getting things in there I noticed she was covering up her body, and I said, \"Don't worry, I don't want to look at your nasty ass body\". Last night I angrily told her I wanted to get a separation and she agreed. And today I told her why I've been really mean towards her. I felt like she didn't find me attractive because we didn't have a lot of sex. And she never did anything sexy for me during the time we were married, even though I was incredibly loving and supportive before this cold streak.

When we are together, I feel like Im with my soulmate. But I haven't been happy and neither has she. So I finally ended it. I feel that my heart needs to heal and I need more respect for myself and I will not get that by holding on and continuing to get hurt. \n\nHowever, I do regret it. I do love her with all my heart. I long for this girl, to hold her and hug her and whisper to her that I love her. To tell her everything will be ok. But I don't know if I believe that anymore. \n\nI wish there was a simple way of healing the pain we've felt and stay together, but there isn't. I honestly believe that I need time away from her. Without reminder and without contact. \n\nI need to stay strong and stay away from her. Is there any other way?\nTL;DR:"}

We last went out for a meal last Thursday and had a walk by the canal. I told her I liked her and she told me she liked me too. When I dropped her off home, she sent me a text saying 'I like you more and more every time I see you!' and on Friday morning she started being ice cold with me (blunt messages, no kisses or emoticons) so I was a bit confused. \n\nThen, she came round to mine last Saturday and she was showing plenty of interest in me, and mentioned me going to see her when she goes to University (in 5 months?!) and how she had a free house in a couple of weeks and she wanted me to come over and keep her company. Then on Monday she was being blunt & cold again and told me that because I told her I liked her it was too much and too fast and it was too much for her to take, I accepted this and then she text me again saying 'it's not that I don't want to I'm just busy' and I've not replied for a couple of days.

We get a little intimate without sex.\n\nWhen she comes home, she doesn't let me know, and when she plans on staying elsewhere, she doesn't let me know. Today, I sent her a simple text, requesting if she could simply give me a heads up if she plans on staying the night with me in the future.\n\nShe called me later in the night and aggressively told me that I was out of line for even asking. I made it known that it wasn't a big deal, I just thought it would be courteous if she could inform me if I would be sharing our room with her or not. I told her that it had nothing to do with me planning on bringing other women over, or anything like that.\n\nI don't mind if she stays somewhere else. I enjoy her company, but I realize things between us are up in the air and I want her to take the space she needs.

She says I'm trying to control her, and that I want her to \"check in\", which is not what I want.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting this information?\nTL;DR:"}

I honestly tried my best to be the best boyfriend, I was there when she needed comfort, I was there when she needed tough love. Even still, Im still in this position. I put my all into it and got literally zero to nil affection back. Even she said that I did nothing wrong and it was her fault.

I know that her and this guy are friends, and she has told me before how she is sure he has a crush on her. \n\nThe constant texting wouldn't bother me as much if she was still paying attention to me, but shes not. Shes sending like 3 or 4 page messages to this guy. Now I haven't read the messages because I don't want to snoop. I just noticed that she was taking 5+ minutes to type out this message. \n\nI have also found out about many occasions that she has hung out with just him. Also she was showing me pictures that she took for her photography class and about 70% of them were of him. \n\nSo here is my question, why would she make it so blatantly obvious that she is interested in this guy? I interpreted her actions as saying, \"talking to this guy is more important to me than spending time with you.\" I have talked to her about it and she told me that she has no feelings for him at all. I don't believe her at all. It doesn't make sense. She knows that I don't care if she has guy friends, as long as they know their boundaries. I have also tried talking to her and telling her how hurt I am and how shes making me feel like I'm less important and she apologized but didn't try to do anything to fix the situation.  She also has flipped the fuck out on me for even reading a text from my best friend (A girl) while in her presence. yet alone me hanging out with said girl.

There was a hint of possibly working things out but it was never communicated to me so I continued to hurt and lash out. The very next day, she was found by a friend of mine on OKC: open to new friends, short-term dating, and long-term dating. When I brought it up, she stated she was just looking for people to talk to.

When he was a little younger there were times when he just didn't want to be held by her or talked to by her, which I contributed to him acting out due to other emotions (hungry, not feeling well, etc.).  However, now that he's communicating more, I can tell that he gets extremely angry when she comes around.  Example: I came home with him last night and when my mom greeted him, he said \"No! Get back!\" and ran off.  Later, he wanted a cup of water and went to the kitchen, and when she offered to get it for him, he went into level 30 rage and ran out, demanding that I did it for him.  \n\nI've tried being extremely patient and talking through the issues with him - explaining that it makes his grandma sad when he acts this way, and he needs to try being nice to his grandma because she loves him.  This has worked in other situations, but with my mom it seems to be ineffective.  I've read on some sites that it could just be developmental, and that it's a phase where he's trying to establish boundaries.  However, I don't understand why the behavior is isolated to my mom.

I haven't snooped in a long time and don't want to do it again as I understand it causes relationship strain.  Curiosity is what did it to me in the past.  Is snooping a common thing?  Is it normal for a person in a marriage to value privacy and be as stand-offish about it as my SO is being?\nTL;DR:"}

So one of them a year after college is getting married - at this point though they're still always out and never do anything really unless every one of them goes - and they say to my dad that they're really sorry but their fiancee wanted a small family thing in a church but he invited my dad to the reception. \n\nSo my mum and dad go to the reception because the groom is one of his best friends so he wanted to give him a gift and stuff and he sees his other two college friends. One of them asks my dad why he wasn't at the wedding and my dad explains he wasn't invited and senses something amiss. \n\nTurns out the two other college bros were the grooms best men and my dad hadn't been invited because the bride was insisting that her brother's toddler be a groomsman instead of my dad so instead of telling him this, he just didn't invite my dad to the wedding. And these were his three best friends in the whole world. Ouch\n\nThen my mum and dad went to see Hook at the cinema because the reception was insanely dull and the bride was a bitch xD\nTL;DR:"}

When I was 18 I left but I went back to visit every few years and this girl stayed in my friendship circle even though we were never close and we would never communicate otherwise.\n\nRecently I went back and visited and ended up spending two or three days with her hanging out and Ive developed a thing for her. The problem is while I was there she was super friendly but since Ive come home ive found it incredible difficult to stay in touch with her. I message her on facebook but she so rarely uses it that theres no real point and I don't know whether texting or whatsapping is too.. imposing. Its the first time i've been in a situation where im always over thinking things and im not used to it. It will come across as arrogant but usually its not this difficult for me.\n\nEvery day that passes makes me want to talk to her more but i don't want to come across as some obsessive individual. So I don't know what I should do. We've exchanged 3 or 4 messages on facebook since then but thats about it. The last message i sent her hasnt been read according to the facebook message thing but its been two weeks! When I left she said we should stay in contact and keep in touch often but since then its been the opposite.\n\nAm I just over thinking things? Am I just missing a major hint here that she was being friendly and thats it. Halp!\nTL;DR:"}

We ( I 23M, her 23F) dated in high school and all through college. When we first started dating I truly loved her and made a lot of promises I shouldn't have. After High School our relationship was almost exclusively long distance. I almost feel like this contributed to the length of our time together. For that past year at least I found myself drifting away. We were talking future plans and the more we discussed the more I realized I didn't want to marry her. \nI told myself I would wait until after I saw her in person to decide for sure how I wanted to progress. She visited from school for a week and we hung out, went on a date, and had sex. But I just felt like I was going through the motions. \nShe is absolutely in love with me and that is why it was so hard to do this. I crushed her and I feel like absolute shit. we broke up over the phone which is also not how I wanted this to be. I wanted to do it in person but we had some conversations that inevitably lead to our break up. It was on Skype so we were \"face to face\" but it's not how I envisioned it. \nThere was a lot of crying but as we spoke I believe she understood where I was coming from and that she noticed me drifting but was in denial. We decided how to give our stuff back and that we still want to be part of each others' lives. I suggested we not talk for awhile.\n\nI guess this is just me getting it out to someone as it just happened and my parents aren't home so I can't talk with them yet. I know it will get better but this was hard and I am sad. She was a big part of my life for a long time. \n\nI have one question; should I still make it a point to see her in person for finality's sake? I feel like I owe it to her. She did not want this. Also any advice or words of encouragement from anyone who has experienced this would be nice. This is in fact the hardest thing I have ever done.\nTL;DR:"}

My parents have never liked Robert mainly because when we dated we got into some trouble. But I mean come on we were really young and immature high schoolers. My parents for the longest time never approved of me dating anyone until my senior year so that's the other reason why they don't like him. Because I hid the fact that him and I were dating.

Around 3 or so years ago after I got my own computer, I started to get really into the internet, and would spend hours at a time in a Skype group chat talking to some friends I'd made online. After awhile, I started to slowly come to the realization that I was bisexual. Apparently, my other friend (19M across the globe in Aus) was starting to realize the same thing. We started to get closer and closer until we finally said \"fuck it, we're boyfriends now\".\n\nThings have been going pretty steady for the past few years. But now, I've been put under a lot of stress in my personal life, and I just don't feel as strong of an attraction to him as I used to. Within the past couple of months, I've noticed myself starting to get attracted to a girl (18F) on Tumblr that I met through a Homestuck group in my city. I'm fairly certain that she has a crush on me too.\n\nThe only problem is, the 19M guy in Aus is really invested in the relationship, and I feel bad because I don't feel like I could return those feelings. Right now, I feel like I need a relationship that's more intimate than just talking over a computer. I feel like our interests have started to segregate as well; he's really into MLP (yeah i know) and I'm not, and we hardly talk as much as we used to. And I feel like I have the opportunity for a closer relationship now. So, I'm not sure if I should stay in the relationship I'm in now, mostly for his sake, and not be as happy as I could be, or leave that and start a new one that has a chance to be the relationship I think I need. I'm pretty sure either option will leave him upset, especially when he finds out that I'm in another relationship so soon (he follows me on Tumblr as well as being friends on Facebook etc)\nTL;DR:"}

But as I age I feel more and more guilt about my desire to stay childless and stay in the relationship. As I age, I become more confident that I do not want children. I have always been honest about this with him though. I've told him since say one that I do not want children (don't want to have them, don't want to adopt)\n\nThe more guilt I feel, the more I feel like being with him is taking away from his time to find someone that he really fits with AND wants children. I don't want him to wake up at 35 wanting children, realize that I still do not, and feel like he's wasted all this time with me, waiting for me to change my mind and then start to resent me. \n\nWe don't really have any other major relationship issues. There's no cheating or abuse or anything. I'm having a hard time bringing this up with him. I keep putting it off because I'm scared and I feel like he's putting off thinking about it or discussing it because everything is good. Everytime I've tried to talk to him about it in the past he's said, \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\" I'm starting to think that we need to have an honest conversation about this though.\n\nAnd I'm terrified of losing him.\nTL;DR:"}

They were having a \"girls night\" and my buddy and I went over and started talking to them. Of course, the one Im talking to and working on has a boyfriend, but she is cool, so Im talking to her anyway. It turns out that they are having drinks as a make up thing, because the girl im talking to (girlfriend) heard from another mutual friend that other girl (cheater) slept with this girls boyfriend. Cheater denies it up and down and they are getting to be good friends again...\n\nIm sitting close to the bar, facing the girls so Cheater asks me to order two shots for the girls on her tab. I tell the bartender \"This girl wants two shots on her tab\" and turn back around. They do their shots and Girlfriend gets up to use the restroom. Cheater at this point says \"You know, the funny thing is I DID sleep with her boyfriend, and it was good! We were at a party and flirting with each other. He should be with me anyway, their relationship is almost over...\" \n\nGirlfriend comes back and Cheater keeps saying things about how happy she is that girlfriend is back in her life and stuff. Cheater gets up and walks to the bar. Girlfriend is a really sweet, trusting girl who is just taking this all in. Im one to let bygones be bygones, but I got girlfriend's number and was talking to her about some other stuff so we could touch base later on. \n\nMy buddy and I get up to leave and the bartender tells me \"Hey, you didnt pay for those shots.\" I said \"Cheater said they were on her tab, I told you that.\" He said \"She came up and said you were paying for them.\" I say \"Im not paying for that.\" At that, Girlfriend gets up and says \"Ill pay for it\". \n\nThis girl is too sweet and is getting shit on by her (supposed) friend and her boyfriend. Should I call her and tell her what happened when she got up to go to the bathroom? Oh, and apparently she and her BF are engaged or getting engaged...\nTL;DR:"}

What's my recourse?\nPOST: I hired a roofer to evaluate roof and address issues prior to selling a home. His evaluation came out to $2000 to replace a small water damaged soffit and an entire eave of shingles and underlayment and everything involved in whatever had caused the leak through the roof and onto the soffit. I thought it wasn't water damage at all but an animal. He stated it was water and needed replaced. With a buyer pressuring me to make deadlines, I agreed to get it done.\n\nAfter completion of work I see that half the soffit has been replaced and there is no evidence of other work. The soffit is unpainted and uncaulked so I have my siding guy finish it. I take pictures before he does this and during.\n\nWhen I called the roofer regarding the work order, he stated that it is complete and when he took the soffit down it wasn't water damaged afterall and was clearly damaged by a raccoon or squirrel. He inspected the roofing material and found it didn't need to be replaced. He said he would send a new bill over and would take our payment then.\n\nAdmittedly I haven't received the new invoice but the figure he threw out there off hand was to knock it down to $1000. I didn't accept or argue at this point because I want to see the invoice before doing so but what are my options? I have other quotes for the soffit work (which he replaced only half of and didn't even paint) from other companies for between $250 and $500. I would never have allowed him to do 1/6 the work order for 1/2 the money had he reported his findings to me.\nTL;DR:"}

Nothing ever happened, but she did have a boyfriend at the time. Now, I have a loving boyfriend and know that I am 100% straight. She is still with her boyfriend, but has admitted to him that she is bi and she has cheated on him with several girls. He is fine with this, and thinks it's 'hot'. Well, recently me & her got drunk together for the first time. The past came up, and we ended up making out. I felt super guilty, but thank god my boyfriend forgave me for it. Ever since, it has been very obvious that those feelings she had for me never went away, as she is acting the same as she did back that (nonstop chatting, hinting at it, etc). Anyways, today she said we needed to talk. I think she wants to actually say it to my face and ask me how I felt when we kissed. I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I feel mad at her for almost ruining my relationship with my boyfriend. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Our dates have been along those standards.\n\nI, however, have not been text/communication-savvy enough to keep talking during the weeks.

I'm highly interested in the country's conversations over different topics but one of the conversations has me highly alarmed.\n\nA few years ago, I could walk around town and see people from my town. Notice their new hair cuts, change of style, maybe they got taller. I just saw THEM as the person they are. I saw police officers and would tip my hat to them because they are doing the civil duties for our city keeping us safe. When tragedies came about, a murder or high profile arrest, the tragedy was that a person did harm to someone else. A person. A person did the illegal act, and another person was the victim. \n\nNow, the view is different. It wasn't a PERSON. It was a BLACK person, or it was a WHITE person. It was a MUSLIM person, a CHRISTIAN person. These labels are defining these individuals in a way that is supposed to generalize this person to a race or religion. The actions of one person does NOT apply to the actions of a whole community or any type of generalization that you may try to associate a person to. \n\nThis rambling all started with me passing a man being pulled over by a police officer on the interstate. I saw the man in the car being pulled over, and he was black. I was imagining the fear he must have felt with all of the media covering the incidents with some police being corrupt and violent for no reason whatsoever. Then I see the police officer walk out of his car. A white police officer. I could imagine his fear as he was approaching a black man, again for the same reason. All of the media covering the senseless killings of police officers by black men. It just gives me a sickening feeling to know that a few years ago, this scene would have been nothing. It would have just been a man getting pulled over by another man. No attention to race, no attention to fear, nothing that would raise alarm.\nTL;DR:"}

Granted she had improved significantly from when we started dating to the end of our relationship, it still put a strain on it from time to time. \n\nWell, the dilemma starts here. Girls of my background & I don't seem to develop the same level of chemistry as I do with girls of other backgrounds. There will be a mutual level of attraction, but that's about it.

We very likely could have flipped and been hurt, maybe critically. \n\nThe truck was towed to the shop were the trans was originally put in and as of this morning the owner is refusing to fix it. My bf is an avid car guy and is pretty adamant that it wasn't put in correctly. A new transmission doesn't just blow apart when your driving leisurely down the highway. \n\nThe BFs aunt was told that there is a 30-day warranty on the trans that won't be honered either because it cracked. BFs parents and aunt are collectively out $1800 and are not the type of folks to have money to spare on this stuff. \n\nThis all seems ass-backwards to me. I've told all the family members to record everything they can when they are dealing with the shop in hopes that a paper trail may help. \n\nAny advice here would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I love people carefully, but when I do, I love them unconditionally. He is one of those guys that every girl wants to date but no one believes exists.

He was meant to come home (USA) with me in December for Christmas to meet my family.  When I asked him about it again just two days ago, he really freaked at the thought of meeting my family (though I lived with his for 2 months), thought it was too much to invest emotionally and decided that he can't 'give me what I deserve'.  So yep, its over and I am now residing in a country where the number of people I know I can count on half of one hand.\n\nReddit, I'm searching for 43 ways to mend my broken heart over the next 43 days - until I go home (alone) for Christmas and am back with my family and closest friends.

We moved in with each other in August.  She has an anxiety disorder and has been depressed as of late because of work.  I try to be there for her as much as I can, but recently i've been feeling bad about certain things I don't know I should feel bad about.

Recently I just purchased my first vehicle by myself, a 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee with just over 70k on the ODO.  Before buying I looked over the CarFax and didn't see any problems reported - no accidents, parts being replaced (outside of tires, filters, and other small things) or vehicle damage to be seen.  Everything looked great.\n\nAfter about 10 days of owning the car, I turned it on one morning to go to work and started hearing an incredibly loud ticking noise.  I did my research online and found it could honestly be a multitude of things (oil too full, one of the o rings in the engine loose etc).  So naturally I took it to a local mechanic to get it checked out.\n\nAfter his inspection, he called me and let me know that the engine was actually replaced with a salvage engine, and that the work under the hood was shoddy.\n\nMy question to you is this - is there anything I can do?

He's a full-time programmer and works pretty long hours the majority of the time. He was raised in an environment where emotions/thoughts weren't expressed in conflict, and has rather authoritative parents. I am very close with my parents and am able to discuss issues, feelings, and thoughts calmly when we don't see eye to eye. \n\nMy husband compartmentalizes issues, but has trouble facing them, if that makes sense. We can discuss and sometimes do come up with a solution, but major issues are put away, often not being brought up again. He can go to bed and the next morning he'll forget about the previous days' conflict. \n\nI think it's his self defense mechanism. He often clams up, and/or will become increasingly desensitized to the issue. He never raises his voice at me, and I have NEVER seen him cry. It doesn't help that he feels that he needs to be strong for the both of us, because of my depression and anxiety. I want to be there for him, but he places my well-being before his. \n\nMy husband is very kind-natured.

She's a really cool friend, we have a few shared views, and get along okay in small bursts.

I don't know if I should communicate my worry or if it will be like picking at a scab and making it worse. As the one without bipolar disorder, I have the responsibility to maintain maturity and calmness. I know bipolar people see things in extremes, so maybe something I did was taken the wrong way, or maybe she is testing me to see if I still like her as a friend.

At the beggining she had plans to go study abroad, but changed her mind for various reasons since then. Three days ago a friend of her parents told her to go study abroad and she completely changed her mind. Her mom is hesitant, her dad supports it. And I suggested to complete her bachelor here and go abroad for her masters degree because I will be able to go with her in that case (cannon go now due to financial issues). All in all, it is 99% certain she will go there. I know I need to support her because I really want the best for her but I just break down and start crying like a little bitch randomly... please help me cope with it. We are talking about 3 years... then I'll move in with her. I am lost...\nTL;DR:"}

But the past few days have just had me wondering...\n\nI've been with the same guy for a year and I couldn't possibly be happier with the relationship overall. Periodically though, he goes through a rough patch where he doesn't act like himself. He'll start acting somewhat careless and standoffish whereas he's usually a big sweetheart and will go out of his way to do adorable little things for me and ensure that I'm happy, and I do the same for him. In the past, this weird behavior has lasted anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. Sometimes I have to sit him down and ask him what's going on before he goes back to acting like himself again (usually after saying he hasn't noticed anything being different). Other times he snaps out of it by himself.\n\nHonestly, I don't feel like I'm acting differently. Could it be that I'm doing something that sets off this weird behavior from him? Or maybe I'm imagining things? With my past and my insecurities, I get so scared that something is wrong with our normally very strong relationship. Do any of you Redditors have any idea of what could be going on? Have any of you gone through anything like this? Any advice or help is greatly appreciated...\nTL;DR:"}

We didn't have to stop at a rest stop and we kept going from breakfast until lunch. \n\nAll of us were starving so we stopped for a strong meal that would keep us satisfied for a long time... And being young, we stopped at Waffle House. \n\nPerhaps you've been to Waffle House or something like it. They are small and greasy but cook delicious meals. Although the food tastes good... It's not the most sanitary. \n\nWe decided to take the risk anyway. \n\nAfterward we all felt satisfied and began driving again but within the first 30 minutes my friend made us pull over. He had food poisoning. We waited for him to do his business and made fun of him for the next hour or so. But because you reap what you sow... 1 hour later my other friend and I started getting the rumbles...\n\nWe stopped at the next exit and rushed into the bathroom. But lo and behold, there was only one toilet and one urinal. He shouted dibs and sprinted into the stall, I briefly considered using the girl's restroom but decided against it. Then, suddenly, my stomach couldn't hold any longer. I had to go. My only options were my pants, the floor, the sink, or the urinal... Not wanting to defile anything else, I chose the urinal. \n\nAfter today I am sure I will be more careful about A) when I mock my friends, and B) where I eat food\nTL;DR:"}

He's still waiting for our reunion, but will it ever happen?\nPOST: I studied for a semester in Madrid in the spring of 2013. I met this Spanish guy who went to the school I was studying at, and he soon confessed his feelings for me. I was hesitant since I knew I would be leaving after a few months. However, he was very charming and we more or less fell for each other. \n\nAfter a while he started (jokingly) mentioning a marriage proposal. He said he \"just knew\" when he met the woman he wants to marry (me). You're probably thinking by now, \"wow, this guy is ridiculous\" and/or \"he only wants one thing.\" Here's the thing though -- I did leave Spain, and even broke contact with him for a while (Facebook friends but no talking), but he still has the same convictions he had when we met. \n\nDue to his seemingly everlasting patience, we have since talked on Facebook and Skype plenty. But the distance hurts. Time and time again I have tried to move on, telling myself I don't love him. I've even outright rejected him a couple times, telling him it'll never work out. He just says he'll be there if I ever want him back in my life again.\n\nThe thing is, I'm lying to myself. I do want to see him again. I think about it a lot. I want to know if this is meant to be.\n\nSo, why not visit each other? As for me, I'm a dead broke college student. So is he, but in a different way. His family is extremely wealthy (not a lie, I had dinner with his mother) but they are very demanding that he finish his education before they let him ship off to see a girl. We both have 2 semesters left. Should I wait this out? Give up (again)? Continue to wallow in self-pity/disgust?\nTL;DR:"}

I can be standing still for one minute, and I'll find that I just start clapping a beat to a song, or clapping a rhythm of some kind, or just clapping randomly. Sometimes, I also tap my hands on things such as tables, walls, my person, and most recently, other people.

I don't know what to do though, because I really do love him.... If I weren't in love, it'd be so easy. \n\nBackground: We dated for just 5 months over this past summer, but had an amazing connection. Same sense of humor, same sense of adventure, same tastes in everything... When we met, he was still seeing someone else the first month, even though we had said we were exclusive. He admitted that when we broke up later in the summer. \nI then found sexual text messages from 3 other girls over the time we were dating, which is why I ended it. \n\nI broke up with him in September. Around Christmas we decided to try again (like I said, I connected with him like I never have with anyone else). and I decided, \"forgiveness, why not give it a try?\"\n\nAnyways, things have actually been really good. When we got back together, he said if I ever wanted to go through his phone, to put my mind at ease while we try to rebuild trust, he would let me.\n\nSo last night, I dropped by his house unannounced.\nHe acted funny, so I asked to see his phone immediately, and he completely refused. I said I'd leave if he didn't show it to me, and then he told me to leave, and basically shoved me out the door. \n\nHe says he was mad I was accusing him of cheating, and also that he had had a bad day and I was making it 10 times worse.... But swears he wasn't doing anything inappropriate. \n\nWhy do I even want to forgive him now? Was I out of line? Is something wrong with me? \n....A couple of close friends say he's emotionally manipulative/abusive. Like yesterday he had a bad day, and then was telling me I made his day worse... stuff like that. \n\nThoughts on rebuilding trust? And when to just walk away?\nTL;DR:"}

We're in the same highly competitive career field, and went to the same grad school about three years ago, where we were both high achievers.  In short, Dave is one of the smartest people I know.  Games, both board and video, are his primary hobby, and since we're long-distance, he's often looking for games we can play one-on-one in the evening. \n\nThe problem is, I suck at games.  It's never been a natural hobby of mine, and while I enjoy them, I can play a game for about 2 hours, and then feel sated for a week.  Even if I try to put some effort into mastering a game, I just can't keep up with Dave.  In addition to having logged a lot more hours over his lifetime, he has a natural affinity for understanding game logic that I don't.  We've been dating for nine months, probably tried at least ten or fifteen different games, and as far as I can recall, I have never once won a match against Dave at anything.  Not a single time in any game.\n\nDave's very patient and always a good sport \u2013 he'll give me pointers if I ask for them, but doesn't get frustrated or boastful or anything else.  I try to shrug off my losses as lightheartedly as I can, but the reality is that I feel like an idiot that I can't keep up.  I've generally felt like there's an intellect imbalance between us, especially since he's older and is further along in our chosen career path than me, and every time I flunk a new game, part of me worries that Dave's going to get bored and call off the relationship.  Even though he's always been pretty chill, I can't entirely believe that he's enjoying the experience when there's no challenge for him.  Constantly losing is embarrassing and disheartening, and I'm not sure what to do or say about it (if anything). If anyone has advice, I'd appreciate it.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not sure exactly what the reasoning for it being an issue is; maybe that the body will just burn the sugar you just ingested, instead of burning body fat. \n\n- That carbohydrates are bad (such as white bread, pasta, rice etc), because the body will process them to sugar, which .. is an issue for some reason (due to the above). \n\nSo, in short. As long as I eat within my max allotted amount of calories per day (1200-1500, depending on my level of exercise), does it matter in any way what I eat (other than how full I feel)?

She is moody a lot, and tends to take her rage out on me, but I still take it and try to calm her down most of the time.\n\nNow, normally, I would be at her house an average of 2-3 times per week. She lives about an hour away from me, so the driving definitely brings up the gas bill quite a bit for me.\n\nShe had previously asked me if I was going to come over for Thanksgiving, and I hadn't planned on doing so because we both have large families that we need to \"hang out\" with, so I told her that I wasn't planning on it, and she became very distraught. She asked me again a few days later, and I said I **MAY** come over if I leave my own family in time.\n\nSo here we are on Thanksgiving, and my own festivities hadn't started until about 5:30. I was expecting to eat at 4, but that didn't happen. So a few hours later, I end up telling her that there is no way that I could make whatever was happening over there. I hadn't left my family's event until about 9PM, which would put me out there around 10. \n\nAfterwards, she has been ignoring me ever since. A few texts here and there telling me that she is very angry and blah blah blah. \n\nThis morning, she started blowing up at me telling me that she doesn't want to be with me for Christmas or any of the holidays, and it all seems rather childish to me.

Using the percent breakdown from 2015, I estimated the number of applicants are in each application year category (wser.org/lottery). Then using the 2^(n-1), I calculated there will be 9166 tickets in the bowl at the start of the process. \nYear 1: 1981 applicants with 1981 tickets\nYear 2: 890 applicants with 1780 tickets\nYear 3: 390 applicants with 1561 tickets\nYear 4: 189 applicants with 1511 tickets\nYear 5: 79 applicants with 1266 tickets\nYear 6: 33 applicants with 1066 tickets\n\nFrom here,\n I used the formula of 1-(n-# of tickets)/n for each of the 270 rounds (wser typically uses an expected draw of 270 wser.org/lottery). For each subsequent round I reduced the total number of tickets by 4 (using a weighted average for the ave year to be selected). So the odds for a single ticket to be selected in round 1 is .02182% round 2 is .02183%. \n\nI then summed the percent chance of being selected in any round to find that for each ticket you hold you have a 3.1% chance of being selected.\nTL;DR:"}

We met in June last year and have been a couple since October 2014. We lived about an hour apart and visisted each other maybe once or twice a week, until this August when she moved across the country to start studying. Basically, this is a long distance relationship.\n\nI have visited her four times since she moved in August, and things have seemingly been great between us. We text daily and call maybe 2-3 times a week. She's very, very dedicated to her studying and spends most of the day at the uni, sometimes up to 12-13 hours.\n\nThe last time I visited her was four weeks ago and we had a great time as usual. We have not had a single argument over the course of the relationship. Three weeks ago I started noticing she was replying more vague on texts and wasn't as eager to talk. Then, in the following week she gave me a call and told me she was very unsure about her feelings. I tried to tell her that all relationships have ups and downs, but she responded with that she didn't think this was anything like that. She asked for a break until she comes home in December so we can have another chat face to face. I have a strong feeling she has already decided that she wants to break it off, but just doesn't want to do it over the phone. \n\nI have tried to respect her wish of having a break, but she has sent me numerous snapchats and texts after this, and we are now back to talking. Albeit only about everyday stuff like school and exams and the like.\n\nI'm sorry if this is boring to read because it feels like it might be, but I have been thinking about writing this post for quite some time, but when I have finally started writing this it seems like I have forgotten all the good points I had planned to type out.\n\nWhat do I do, reddit?

Their loss, my gain, etc.\n\nI didn't receive a copy of the actual lease until October, when I also received a document billed as a \"transfer of rights\" that would transfer the lease from the old tenant to me.\n\nI never signed the lease transfer agreement.\nI was originally under the assumption that the rooms were rented separately, but months into the thing I've found that we are all together on 1 lease.  1 of the other 2 roommates is notoriously low on funds, late on bills, etc. So the landlord consistently hounding me about the rent balance is what made me aware of the actual terms of the lease agreement.  So we've all been essentially paying 1/3 of the rent separately out of convenience.\n\nThe late-paying roommate seems to have taken his things and vanished, 2 weeks before the lease is up. He has an outstanding balance for the last couple months. I assume he won't pay because he lied about establishing some sort of payment plan with the landlord, \n\nSo, having not signed the lease transfer agreement but essentially living as an implicit subletter for the last 9 months, will legal recourse come back to me when the landlord goes after the lease-holders for his back-rent?

Today I decided to move back home with my parents while I search for a job teaching art. \n\nMy deciding factors include: \n\nHe is extremely depressed and angry because he can not find a job (3 interviews/68 applications). I first blamed his depression on the stress of writing a book and a dissertation during the three years we lived together. When he finished one accomplishment I told myself now he can relax and be happy, but he never was. I am afraid that I will keep telling myself \"as soon as he gets ____ he will be happy and then we will be happy.\" \n\nA few months ago he confessed to me that his life has been one embarrassment after another. He also told me that it had crossed his mind that after graduation we no longer have a commitment to be together.  This broke my heart because I thought after graduation we could get jobs, and he would finally give me the ring I've been waiting for. I realized this will never happen so today I decided I didn't want to continue going on like and started packing my bags.  \n\nShould I help him through the depression with hopes that things will get better or should I follow through with the threat of leaving for good?\n\nDuring the first month of student teaching I made many empty threats because I didn't have the confidence to manage my own classroom. My co-op said \"I bet you do that in your personal life as well,\"   she hit the nail on the head.

Yes, I was cheated on by someone I thought wouldn't and it has had deep impact on how I function in relationships. \n\nMy current girlfriend (23f) of almost a year is very understanding about it but I can tell it's frustrating her and she's getting tired. I totally understand if she can't handle it. Though it would break my heart, I know that she can't continue doing this for much longer. It's just not fair to her. \n\nMy thing is that to address my issues I need the triggers of being in a relationship. In the past I've always blamed my significant others for my break-ups \"Oh, she's crazy...\" or \"She was probably cheating on me anyway\" but the past few years I've realized that, though I've had issues with past SO's, the break-ups were almost always due to me not carrying enough trust, accusing and arguments.\n\nI understand that this does not paint me out to be a decent person. And that's what I've been struggling with. It's a cycle of not trusting, arguments, me feeling like shit for accusing, feelings of worthlessness, then back to square one. I realize how shitty this is, not only to the person I'm with but I've hurt myself a few times with the intention of putting an end to it. \n\nI'm at my wit's end and really don't know what to do. I'm seeing a therapist now but it's going really slow and I need some suggestions from people that have lived it, are living it or also need help.

Ideally I'd love to move to the US straight after I finish University and live with my gf but that would be a dream come true and possibly asking too much i guess. \nI understand to be able to get a working visa in the US I'd have to have secured a job before applying or be recognised as an \"artist\" and i'm not sure if that's going to be easy. \nI saw her this Christmas Holidays and I'm going to see her again soon but after that I'm not sure when I'll be able to see her again\u2026 We've been very patient so far but I fear it could only go so far.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Girlfriend keeps me and her friends separate.\nPOST: Me 23, her 23, been together 8 months.\n\nThings are great, overall.  I love her, we talk about our future together, we both are on the same page about everything. The difficult part is that she can't really handle hanging out with me and her friends at the same time. She says that when I'm there, she can't be present for her friends and that it changes the dynamic.  Which I totally understand.  We usually do one night of the weekend where we are together, one where she's with her friends.  I have no problem with her hanging out around my friends. I generally have a large group of friends, and we can just hang out with whoever is there, and nothing changes that much.  I mean, guy time without her around is different, but I am comfortable asking her if she wants to come out with us, which is fine by all my guy friends and we still have a good time.\n\nShe, however, has a small group of friends. She really never invites me to do things with them.  She hangs out with me most nights, but she'll be like, Friday, me and my friends are gonna go to ____.  The problem is, her friends are in my extended group of friends, and often are going to the same place where my friends are, and it's weird, because I feel like I shouldn't show up because she won't be able to handle it. I don't know, it just makes me feel odd that it's so dividing like this.  I'm friends with all of her friends, and one of them even invited me tonight, assuming that I'd be with my girlfriend, because her and my girlfriend and the rest of their group already had plans to hang it.  It's just weird getting an invite from my girlfriend's friends, but not my girlfriend.  My girlfriend is extremely loyal, which is what I love about her.  But it's just annoying when I feel like I have to avoid places or am missing out on a get-together because my girlfriend and her friends are there.  How can I deal with this?\n\nMy girlfriend is also amazing about giving me time.  I always feel like a priority and I know she loves me. It's just weird when I feel weird about going places.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25F] with my boyfriend [35M] of about a year, his pre-existing trust issues are coming in between us. Advice?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year.  Prior to dating me, he was in a long term relationship that ended in a nasty way, resulting in him having major trust issues.  As with most couples, we have had some ups and downs, but nothing that communicating hasn't seem to work out.  Until now...\n\nLately, I've been having questions that can't be definitively answered by him (things pertaining to the time-line of our relationship).  Due to this, my thoughts have been spinning out of control.  I tried talking to him about it, and it helped very little.  I tried talking to friends and that didn't help much more.  So I installed the app Whisper to post things in the hopes that the immediate nature of posting things could help me settle my thoughts. (It is worth noting, that this is how he and I met, then we both uninstalled it shortly after seeing each other).\n\nThis weekend, he was putting music on my phone from the computer.  When he plugged my phone in, he saw a folder for Whisper.  He then, for a lack of better words, shut down.  He didn't tell me to leave or stay, so I stayed, but he was distant for the rest of the day.  He didn't touch me at all, which is not normal for us.  Sunday morning wasn't any better, and he told me that it all feels like a dream and that he's just numb even though he feels that he should be upset.\n\nWe talked, I told him everything that I had posted, I was even willing to show him my phone and have him go through it, but he refused.  But he's struggling to believe me even though I did nothing wrong.  I'm giving him space in the meantime, which isn't the easiest.\n\n \nIs there anything else I can do to help make this situation easier?  How can we/I deal with this pre-existing trust issues in the future?\nTL;DR:"}

I did the SOP and filed a report to the local police department, my land owner, and the HOA. At that time they apologized and said that they were already planning on putting up security cameras because I wasn't the first one to complain. I move on with life and think that this was a one time thing. Lo and behold, my brother's car got broken into also just a few days ago. He called the HOA and they gave him the same answer they told me four months ago (that they were putting up cameras and that he wasn't the first one to report the incident). Now, I admittedly don't know much about the HOA and how long it usually takes them to get things done but it's very disheartening to live in a semi-gated community and feel unsafe. I wanted to talk to the HOA directly but my brother told me not to cause he knows my temper. I intend on calling them in the next few days but wanted to ask for advice first. What can I do/say to make them be more proactive and move quicker? Knowing that you live in an unsafe place is really disheartening and depressing. Thank you!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm pretty damn skinny, and I'm totally OK with it. Rock climbing keeps me pretty slim and strong. The only problem I have with my body is my 16 year old looking babyface, which I'll admit is frustrating, but nothing can be done about it. \n\nNow the problem, but first let me preface. I don't believe I have my standards too high, I'm not looking for a supermodel or anything of the sort.\n\nAll the girls I seem to attract, granted usually through Tinder, are overweight. I've only dated one girl I was physically attracted to, which was amazing while it lasted. That relationship has been done for 4-5 months, and I've seen a few people on and off. Of course using Tinder, the catfishing is rampant, and every single one has been significantly heavier than me and most have personalities I don't get on with. \n\nThe sad part is that I still go along with it because I'm so god damn lonely, and sick of third wheeling that I can barely handle it. The conversation sucks, and eventually when sex happens.... its a huge turn-off. I find myself either being so drunk I don't care, or faking enjoyment. Usually the former.  \n\nI can't do that to myself anymore, and I definitely don't want to hurt anyone's feelings by leading them on. Its not their fault I'm this way. I dunno reddit, I feel hopeless. Like I'll never find something that works. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Is there anything that could allow a credit card company to add a charge past the statement date (details inside)\nPOST: So here's the deal:\n\nLast month I purchased a shiny new power supply ($90) from newegg.com.  I used my \"Preferred Account\" which is their financing option and is run by \"Bill Me Later\".  After the order goes through I immediately remember I forgot to add my gift card to the purchase, so I call them up and they cancel the order for me so I can repurchase.  They mention the refund will go through in about a week, and I go and repurchase the item with the giftcard for a total of around $40.\n\nTo my understanding, this should have left the account with a $50 credit, expressed as a balance of -$50.  However days go by and my account remains at -$90.  About a week later I buy a desktop case for about $50, which goes though and brings my balance to -$40.  Both the case and the power supply are in my possession and are recorded in my order history as successful purchases.\n\nI just received my statement for the month of April, with the balance of -$40 still displayed.  I called up the Preferred Account Hotline, and the CS rep notices everything as I had mentioned and explains that since the account is managed by a third party, it is possible the mistake is on their end.  She also told me that to her knowledge there is no incoming charge to the account that is invisible to me, nor is there a flag of any sort indicating an error.\n\nSo my question: is it ok to assume that the credit will remain as is until I spend it.  I noticed a deal on an item I was interested in, but would not otherwise have the money for without the $40 credit that is in my account.  Is there any sort of definite rule or law that states once a statement is released, it can't be altered?\n\nThanks for your Help\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by having to drop out of my University program.\nPOST: Some backstory. I'm not the most smartest kid, I get middling grades, but I usually do allright. My university has a policy that to continue in my Engineering program, I need to have a 60 average over the year. Coming from highschool where I didn't really try or study at all, I ended up royally fucking up during my first year of University and only got a 55 average. The school ended up giving me a break, and let me retake any courses I didn't get a 60 in(most of them) and ended up getting above a 60 average. That was 3 years ago. \n\nFast forward to today. I've been done school for the past month and a half, but haven't checked my grades since I've been scared shitless I've failed all of them. So today I told myself everything would be fine, and checked my grades. I passed all of my courses. Now a pass is anything above a 50. Everything looked good, I was happy. Then I saw the little fine print under the grades. \"Must drop out of the Faculty of Engineering.\" I was frozen for a good 2 min, not really grasping what I had just read. Then it hit me. I didn't get a 60 average. I had too many 58's and 59's. My average ended up being 59.2, and since I had already been given a break in my first year, I am fucked. I don't know how to tell my parents that I've basically ruined the last 4 years of my life. That I've wasted thousands of dollars for nothing. \n\nNow I know I could have prevented this. I could have studied harder. But I tried my best. And now I have to live with the consequences. I know all this, but it's still hard. It doesn't help that I've had a minor case of depression since highschool, so this really hurts. I don't know what to do. I'm just straight fucked.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Employer wants a four year contract, or will charge departing employees for any training - NY\nPOST: I recently gave in my notice at my current job. My manager expressed frustration that all of their experienced employees leave*, and they end up having to take time an resources to train new ones, as there is a lack of skilled, experienced people in my field, in my area. \n\nWhile I did have prior experience, my current employer has very exacting standards, and requires everyone, including myself, to be trained. There are no schools in state that offer programs in this area, so on the job training is the norm for most staff. There are several functions that an employee can be trained to perform. This is beneficial to both the employer and the employee, but is always done at the whim of the employer. There is no guarantee of training in more than one function, though their stated goal is to \"cross-train\" everyone. it is usually a necessity for people to be able to perform more than one function.\n\nApparently, my impending departure has them trying to figure out how to keep employees, and the solution they have come up with is to have an employee sign a 4 year contract for each new function they are trained for, or else pay an undisclosed sum for their \"training.\" As an example, I myself serve four functions currently, which potentially would be a 16 year commitment. This seems insane to me, given that their goal is to \"cross-train everyone.\"\n\nI personally feel that the training of new employees is their cost of doing business, especially when their very exacting standards require training even experienced professionals. I know that they want to protect their investment, but four years is a long time, especially given that the training periods are usually about 3 months long, and during that time the trainee is performing at about 75% of full capacity. This seems strangely close to indentured servitude to me, and I'm wondering, is such a contract legally enforcable?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: \"Don't make someone a priority in your life when you're only an option in theirs.\" Sort of a follow-up.\nPOST: Late 20s, male, US, very small town\n\nI read this quote somewhere when I was in the midst of struggling with a relationship. I had been seeing a girl that I found myself becoming strongly attracted to, beyond the physical sense, and thinking I wanted to date her. Trouble was, she made it clear that she wanted no sort of relationship, and at the same time was very aware that I strongly wanted a relationship. We did all the things bf/gf's do, including physical intimacy, texting each other all day, talking, hanging out, meeting one anothers family and friends, etc. A couple times I pressed her to make it official, but she constantly resisted.\n\nI posted here for advice, and got some good stuff. Then I read this quote, which I though succinctly summed up the gist of the advice I got on reddit.\n\nBut it wasn't easy to try to put this into practice. Being such a small town, I didn't have the option of just \"finding someone else.\" There are only a handful of single girls in my small town, and most of them are outside of my dating pool. So we still did the same things together.\n\nFinally, last weekend, I met another girl who took an interest in me. I contacted her this week, and she took the initiative and asked me out! \n\nThat's what it took... suddenly it all made sense. I had been pining for a girl who only wanted me around when it was convenient for her. She was aware of my desire to make it something more, and not only did she say no, but she toyed with me for months by keeping me around -- leading me on, so to speak, even though her stance on relationships was always in the back of my mind.\n\nBut finally, on this other date, I realized this is what it's all about. You can chase the things you can't have, but it will never work. The idea is to find someone who wants to be in your company just as much as you want to be in theirs. That's how it's supposed to be!\nTL;DR:"}

The last girl I was dating told me a few months ago that she had been cheating on me, and I didn't know how to react at first. We tried to work our relationship out. She seemed ashamed of it, and acted like she still wanted to be together. I stupidly bought into it, and we worked things out for about another month. We broke up, and the next day, went out and had a fling with the same guy she cheated on me with, and shortly after is now seeing another guy. I know it's all stupid, and I really shouldn't care, but I've been really down lately. My relationship with my parents haven't been that great since middle school, I'm in my first year of college, facing academic probation because of my GPA, and my friends only really seem to talk to me when they have some sort of problem with their life. Throw the whole cheating situation in, and... I just don't know what to do. It makes me wonder if something is wrong with me? I don't know.\nTL;DR:"}

Things have been great. When we're together, the world is awesome. It's when we are apart, that I begin to get this anxiety. I can't describe it. I can't get her off my brain. I think it's because I recently quit smoking and my brain is trying to latch onto some other addiction. I don't know though. \n\nI've NEVER been this way about a woman. Ever. She's completely different than any other woman I've dated. We're kind of opposites. First off, she's older and more mature (but just as silly as me behind closed doors.) She doesn't text me back a lot. I get that she's busy. She's a boss (literally.)She's not a very feelingsy person (but shows affection). Very strong and independant. I think it's just trying to adjust to a new relationship/person and getting the dynamic down.\n\nShe's already said I love you and that I'm her rock during a this very very rough time in her life (Her house burned down two weeks ago. I was there and still am there for her every step of the way). She says she loves my affection and truly does.  She's wonderful. \n\nWe're truly comfortable with each other. She's already brought up little tiny slivers of marriage type talk (small comments such as \"You should have told your boss you're helping the woman you're going to marry\") and in no way does that freak me out. I trust her to the fullest. She's been honest every step of the way and even chided me on a small, needless fib. I don't know, guys. Why am I freaking out? Over stupid shit? and What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

One day I have a mishap with my father (whom I recently had to move back in with) and he kicked me out of the house. The same day I came out to my sister, and later told this guy that I told my sister I had a \"boyfriend\". Ever since then he has been going through some shit of his own, getting sick and whatnot, and he had been really distant. We haven't had sex in over a week, and text for five minutes a day and then don't speak. He told me he wasn't ready for a relationship because he \"needed to get his head above water\" and I accepted it. But I miss him, and what we used to have.

We were really close and became close with another girl, B. After a while, B got a SO and stopped talking to us. A is really bitter and likes to talk about people behind their backs, and proceeded to do so. We drifted from B, mostly because I listened to what A said and just tried to avoid confrontation. A and I moved into a place with a bunch of people, and she proceeded to be a horrendous bitch. The stuff she pulled was beyond low, and I still have horrible nightmares about living with her where I wake up panicking. She shit talked everyone, turned everyone against each other, took over half the house, threw fits, and basically made the apartment super stressful.\n\nSo we politely kicked her out. She proceeded to shit talk all of us nonstop, and of course went running back to B. Fast forward to years later, and I'm living very far away. They are the furthest things from my mind, except for my occasional sweaty moments where I remember how stressed out I was at that time and how terrible I always felt and how she always talked me into the dumbest shit.\n\nB is talking to a couple mutual friends I barely talk to, but I think about how I'd like to be her friend again. We used to collaborate on projects and it was really fun, but I was told A is still really close to her...TOTALLY not worth it. \n\nBut I find myself mourning the loss of our friendship.

She has set up rules about not letting anyone from my family over in the apartment when she is there. I want to go and at this point I'm thinking that it should be alone.\n\nWhat is the right way to handle this? We live together right now and she has a job here. She's unstable as well; threatened/attempted suicides before, threatened to call the police on my family (my brother has a drug problem, it's one of the reasons I'm moving home -- to help them deal with him). My family suggested that I just pack up and go and leave her there. Only my name is on the lease. The lease expires after Sept 30, so she'll have to be out by then. I think that's just going to create a stalker or some other situation that is not going to leave me alone. The last few weeks she will wake up some nights with panic attacks about being alone and homeless. I don't know what I should do; being a dick and being a nice guy are both crappy options.\nTL;DR:"}

We were a small company, so there was room for a 23 year old in an entry-level job to get noticed and have an impact.\n\nWell, I got a good resume from that.  I ended up doing quite well in the long run.  But, I had a couple months of shitty unemployment.\n\nIn my new job, I have control over many large online ad campaigns.  It's quite easy to block websites.  Only a few mouse clicks.  Campaigns can easily run across a few hundred thousand websites without anyone ever looking at a single domain.  My campaigns do well, so no one needs to double check anything.\n\nSo, I've gone out of my way to block said major media company a few times.  It has taken me longer to write this post than it has to block them.

Have three daughters. A few months ago. She had to go out of town for a work conference. The last time i had talk to her that day was at 8am. Just before she left. The conference is about 3 hours from where we live. I had texted her through out the day with no response. I figured she was just busy and couldn't reply. 10pm rolls around and still no reply. So i am getting really worried at this point. I ended up finding an Android app i could download to her phone and get the GPS location. By this time it is 2am. It shows she is at the Hotel she is suppose to be at. So im like WTF. Than i started browsing the app i had downloaded. And i am able to record the voices that are around the phone. So i do some recordings. And there is a mans voice in her room. I can tell whose voice it is and its one of her coworkers. This was a person she was suppose dislike. But the way they are talking and some of the stuff that's being said. Its like they're a couple. I cant make out a lot on the recordings. But at one point she says she has to pee. And he says i thought you went before you got in bed? And there joking around if some one had seen them going up to the room. I finally talk to her around 2:10am. She denies there is any one in the room. After telling her what i had heard she finally admitted he was there but they were just talking.\n\nBasically within the recordings there is no true smoking gun saying they did anything. But a lot of it is hard to make out. I would be long gone by now if we didn't have three kids. And no real proof. All she admits to is have a guy in her hotel room. I've confronted him. He just says nothing happened and i would be a fool to leave her over this. I've tried enhancing the audio my self with no such luck. From my understanding. She was with this guy from 11pm till 2:30am. And all they did was talk.\nTL;DR:"}

I want to be in a relationship again, and so I've started approaching more and more women that I've found attractive.

So I diluted the gallon/4 liters or so with cold seawater until it felt like a good temp.

We've taken a scared dog class that he did well in, but it's different outside of the classroom. \n\nBasically, I have a couple questions/thoughts:\n\n1) Will a dog that is this anxious be able to adjust to a fourth home?\n\n2) Will he be able to trust other people again or will he feel that we abandoned him?\n\n3) Is his situation going to improve or might he be worse off after leaving us?\n\nOverall I'm just unsure about keeping him or giving him to a more experienced owner. I do want what is best for him, but I'm not sure what that is. We do live in a city with a high crime rate, and it's nice to feel safe with him in our house. However, it is also very stressful not knowing if he will react aggressively around our friends and family. \n\nThank you for any help or similar stories.\nTL;DR:"}

I head to class and I find out it's been called off because of some confusion which lead to most students heading home thinking no class was on. Well apart from me and a girl I'll call Emma here.\n\nWe both had an essay to complete in class, and the class being cancelled was a lifesaver as I hadn't revised for the essay. She's a bit miffed now because she can't go home yet as she has rehearsals in an hour. I've known her for a long time but we've been nothing more than casual friends. \n\nAnyways, I get ready to head home again and we walk together back to the common room so I can I sign out and leave. As we're walking back I joke about school and work and she's obviously enjoying the conversation. We reach the common room and turns out it's bloody empty as everybody else is either at home or in their last lesson. \n\nAs I'm signing out she reminds she has nothing to do for an hour and asks if I've got any ideas. I don't have anything to do for an hour apart from sit in a shite London commute, but it doesn't occur to me that maybe she wants to sit and talk more. \n\nInstead I just say \"right, I'm off, see you.\" She responds with \"*Oh,* err... bye?\"\n\nOnly as I'm walking alone in the pouring rain, to catch the bus and do fuck all for 40 minutes do I realise that maybe I could have used that hour with her. Clearly we had a lot to talk about, I could have even asked her to go through some of the work for the essay we had to do for the cancelled class - or we could have just continued chatting.\n\nI'm home now, and she probably just spent the last hour completely alone in the common room waiting for her rehearsals. My question is, **am I an idiot for not staying and talking with her today?\nTL;DR:"}

Ever since I went from 145lbs to 175lbs my first year in college\u2026 the only problem is that number never went down. It only grew and at 200 lbs I told myself, \"This is it. I'm changing.\" Now, 22 years old at 235lbs I hit rock bottom. I tried lots of different things but ultimately the number only grew. It wasn't until my best friend - then my mom - then my fella's cousin all decided to get married in the same month that I really kicked myself into gear. \n\nI joined a 24 hour gym (I work a shift schedule) and downloaded the app Loseit on my phone. I'm watching my calories and carbs and making sure I get enough protein and fiber. I've been going to the gym 4-5 days a week after work. It's cutting into the little amount of time I get to see my fella (who has been extremely supportive) because he is still a student and our schedules are opposites. But so far it seems worth it. I'm happier and more active. \n\nI am down **10 lbs** to 225 and already am starting to feel better. Pictures will come later. I'm posting to ask what kind of exercises you all recommend. I have been doing 40 minutes on a treadmill a night.

However, I've always battled with feelings of jealousy. The relationship has been long distance for most of this time and with my overactive imagination, I can't keep from imagining that when she parties on the weekends she's messing around with other guys. I know she is a good and honest girl, and so I'm trying to get over these feelings. Any advice on that front would be helpful; however, my main problem is that I accidentally found out what her facebook password was a while ago and, though I know this is wrong, I somehow got into the habit of logging in to her account every now and then and looking around a bit. This can only end badly for me, and I know that, but I'm having trouble breaking the habit. It's so enticing, especially considering that I've found things in the past that fed my anxiety (nothing really worth worrying about, but small things like messages to friends that could be interpreted the wrong way). I need to force myself to stop doing this, but I can't tell her that I know her password and ask her to change it, because that would create a whole new set of problems. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nTL;DR:"}

It was graded and I received enough to secure an A in the course. However, this morning I check my email and their is a notification that my grade has been changed. Investigating it further reveals that the grade is now a zero and that the professor wonders why another student submitted my assignment (exact copy).

The papers were about 8-10 pages of text (analysis) and neither of us copied each others work.

I have been barred from any chance of properly doing so by my ex's lack of maturity. Let me begin by asking you to take a moment to put yourself in my shoes as I guide you through my personal Hell: \nYour spouse leaves you mid relationship, finds another man, and kicks you to the curb without consulting you about it. Her new guy gets to reap all the benefits of a life you help build which includes influencing the lives of your children. All the while, you get wildly unfair restrictions on child visits and have to pay child support. Child support which goes to feed 3 other children, 4 dogs, 2 turtles, 2 rabbits, erratic spending and her mother's soap business (which is run from her kitchen). This is but a mere sample of it, but at least it can help empathize. \n  Flash forward 5 years\u2026 you rebuild yourself from the shattered being you once were and found someone that makes you feel like you can take anything on. You introduce her to your children and they hit it off. Baby mama gets jealous and stirs up a shit storm of envy and tightens the grip on the already ridiculous restrictions you have with your children and this is not the first offense by far. So let me ask you all a question? Why does she get to live her life as she sees fit, but think that she has control over mine?

Need advice\nPOST: You guys have always helped me with relationship advice and I'm not sure who else to talk to. I have been dating my SO since second semester of college and we both graduated and now live together in an apt. I know I still love him a lot, but I feel like it's changed. I also noticed my libido is different and we don't have sex as often. We both work full time now which could be the cause as well. I am trying to switch my birth control too to a lower hormone one. I am just so scared that I am falling out of love or unsure if I'm just feeling depressed lately. We moved to a new city so I don't see my friends or family as much. The thought of breaking up terrifies me because we have so much history and I really see myself with him in the future. I think he'd be a great dad. I just notice that we get into little tiffs more, but I guess that's common when you move in and are in close quarters. \n\nHe's my first serious boyfriend and I think I got lucky with him but I don't like these thoughts. He is a great guy and hasn't done anything bad to me. Never violent and doesn't yell. He's nice to my friends and we have a lot in common. Am I just overthinking this all? Have any of you gone through the same thing? I am just tired of feeling like this.. There are days when I'm really happy and optimistic and then I just feel like nothing.\nTL;DR:"}

Previously, I was in solid LTRs (explanation below) for roughly 6-7 years and I'm completely out of practice as far as the dating scene goes. My recent experiences show that I have a tendency to get friendzoned before anything happens.\n\nWell, my sister had the idea to set me up with a girl my age that is in her performance group. I agree and get a name, do some facebook stalking so I know who to look out for, and a few days later I go to a performance. Then after the performance I go to where they're cleaning up and my sister introduces her to our mom and myself. I couldn't think of anything I could do or say in the situation with the overbearing-ness that was my sister and mom standing right there. So I introduced myself and that's about it. I am sure I came across as shy. We made eye contact for only a couple seconds.\n\nI'm definitely interested and don't want to mess it up.\n\nSo basically at this point I don't know any of her contact info and we're not friends on facebook. I'm looking for tips on how to proceed. I found the [how to flirt guide] this morning, is there anything similar I could reference? Should I let my sister continue to set us up or should I step in? When should I take the reins?\n\nLTR Explanation: For the last 6-7 years I suppose you could say I took the \"easy way out\" and simply started a relationship with an old girlfriend from high school or something. From what I remember, very little was needed in the way of flirting or building attraction, as I already knew them fairly well before we started dating.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: Tifu by listening to rap...\nPOST: Okay so to start off, let me tell you that Big L is my favorite rapper of all time. If you've never heard of him, I HIGHLY suggest you look him up. Anyway so before I actually begin with the story let me tell you that about a week ago I hooked up with a really beautiful girl I've always had a crush on. So after a few days of getting to know each other a bit better, we went on our first date and everything was so perfect. I learned she liked ACDC a lot, and she learned I loved rap. I didn't state any one person though, so she may have assumed I liked Eminem and/ or Snoop Dogg (which I do.) Everything is going fine and dandy until yesterday. During school I told her she should come over to meet my parents. She called her parents and they were fine with it too. Great right? Wrong. Here comes the tifu. So I got home yesterday and decided to listen to some music before she came over. I plugged in my headphones, the ones that really suppress outside noises, and started singing along to Big L's '98 Freestyle. Well it was getting to the end of the first verse, and my mom let in my girlfriend so we could all talk. They walk in, and since I'm facing away from them I didn't notice either. Right when they walk in I sing the line, \"If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool.\" I hear a door slam and I quickly turn around. I see my mom standing there with the most disappointed look I have ever seen. I took out my headphones and asked what the hell just happened. She explained they just walked in to hear me sing that line, and then my girlfriend burst into tears and ran out. Shit. Turns out she left, and now she won't answer my calls or texts. I'll need to show her the song tomorrow at school. Hopefully she'll understand.... Hopefully.\nTL;DR:"}

The recent bout of adviceanimal memes about people who had their wives/husbands suddenly screw them over after long and apparently happy relationships has only served to intensify this fear. \n\nWe are past what would generally be called the \"honeymoon period\" and have tried to be fairly diligent about analyzing our relationship (using contracts that chart expectations/norms and frequently communicating any trepidation we have about our stage in life), but the feeling of happiness we have with who we are and where we are in life just seems to keep growing. As the happiness grows so does the sense of dread that it can't last forever and we are just biding time until some fault line forms in our relationship. \n\nWhile she has never dated anyone before me, I have dated a lot of people before, so I know perfectly well you can't make someone promise not to fall out of love with you and that just because you love someone today doesn't mean you will in a few years. A big part of our original planning before we decided to get engaged was to ensure we would be happy being married to each other even if we fell out of love ... but maybe we weren't and aren't able to be objective in making that decision. \n\nSo I guess my questions are:  \n* How long does the happiness last in your experience?  \n* Has anyone here been in a relationship that didn't have the happiness end?  \n* Is it possible to make an objective judgment as to whether or not you will be compatible with someone you are presently in love with after you fall out of love with them?  \n* Are you in a relationship with someone you no longer love but are still happy being with them?\nTL;DR:"}

As this happened his arm wrapped around me so we were basically cuddling and I instinctively scooted closer and we kinda laid there like that for a good 30 seconds. After that he rolled onto his back (me still laying on one arm) and we started chatting and it was cool and I wasn't trying to hook up or anything, but I enjoyed hanging out like that and getting to know him a little more. So we kept talking until I referred to the girl that was still in the room, but then we both realized that she wasn't even there anymore and I was like what and he kinda freaked out and ran out the room saying something about seeing who was out there (As if anyone was awake at 4am). A while later the girl comes back and she lays in the bed on her phone so I just kinda get on my phone to wait for the guy but he's just like gone so I decide to just go to bed. \n\n>Maybe 10 minutes later I come back out to get some water and hear the guy back in the room with the door closed.

I saw a post earlier about a mini/micro-home and it brought up container housing which seems like it would be perfect for me.\n\nHowever, it seems like these homes are pretty much price equivalent per square foot to traditional housing and I can't understand why.\n\nA new container can be had for $10,000 per 300 sq. ft. and used ones (which are hard to find suitable ones) for $2,500 per 300 sq. ft.  The cost of shipping can't be that astronomical (they are shipping containers for Christ's sake).  I know a lot has to be done for insulation and what not, but it still seems like $40 a finished sq. ft. should be an attainable figure.  But, all the options I've seen have been around $100 a finished sq. ft.  But, they are all a lot fancier than I would want...\nTL;DR:"}

We started talking and haven't stopped since them. She has been making most of the effort to keep the conversation going. We used to talk a lot about relationship advice and we used to both be in a relationship with others before we parted ways for a while. Now we are both single and I really want to make a move before she ends up with another guy. However two problems. She thinks I am still in a relationship with someone else but I ended that a few days ago. And I haven't told her for fear of her thinking that I broke up with the other girl for her. She also made a comment about us not developing feelings for each other so it wont become awkward and we wont stop talking because she values the friendship a lot. However part of me thinks (or wants to think) that she is saying that to shield herself from falling for me.\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend also works for the company but at another store as a manager. A couple weeks a go she worked 48 hours in one week the other week she worked 38 hours. On her check all she received was 1 hour of overtime. This happened to quite a bit of people at all the stores. There's 3 in my city. This isn't the first time its happened either but now everyone is fed up. Because the company says that they will not pay anything over 40 hours. But that they will be back paying everyone back up to the April 17th. Also one pay period about a month ago these douches paid everyone at my store only half there check. We got paid the rest like 3 days later. Yesterday one of my coworkers confronted two owners of the company while they were at our store. The two claimed to be mostly ignorant but that they need to make some phone calls. About an hour or so later. The area coach and another higher up chick came and talked to my coworker privately saying things like you don't have your facts straight and stuff like that trying to intimidate her.

So instead of sorting them from highest value to lowest value, left to right, I went by diameter, largest to smallest. The pennies messed up the line of shiny so I put them back on the far right, proud of myself (remember I was stoned) for my new method of sorting by color AND shape. I cannot stress enough that this was about sorting shiny things being moderately stoned, or how impressed my moron ass was for sorting by two dimensions.\n\nSo someone comes to switch registers with me so I can take my lunch break, and notices my change cups. She asks me what's up with my change, so I explain that I sorted them from widest to thinnest. She asks why the pennies are separate, and with no clue what she was getting at I answer simply \"because they're a different color.\" Her eyes go wide, and with this insulted-but-I'm-better-than-you voice she just goes \"okay, take your half.\" \n\nI didn't even know what she was mad about until someone asked me about it later. Apparently she complained to a manager. We watched a workplace sensitivity video at the next all-hands.

I'm able make her orgasm and do so very consistently. She isn't as skilled at pleasing me, although she is willing. \n\nI'm not overly fond of her family or friends. She likes mine but I struggle connecting with hers for the most part. I flat out disagree with some of her family.\n\nI realize I am in my prime years. I'm told I'm am handsome and I'm pretty smart.

A couple bumps in the road from work and school, and she drills into me one night about slacking off. I force her hand and its over in 5 minutes.\n\nMy question is how do I get closure? She doesn't seem interested in re-talking the breakup because its been done before. I honestly was thinking one way (marriage) and she was thinking the other I guess.\n\n5 days after the breakup shes tagged in a photo with a random guy at a bar. I know that this is typical her, going to bars hanging with friends after we break up. Its just so weird because she never was interested in that while together. She swore up and down the only reason for the breakup, which \"wasn't planned\", was because she was tired of me slacking off.\n\nI understand that some time apart will be good for us. But 5 days? I feel like she cheated on me. I just found out about that today, and pretty much confirmed my thoughts. Something about her story just didn't add up. She refuses to speak to me on the phone or see me. She isn't mad at me, just knows that we talk and always end up back together. \n\nI feel so bad, but I have finally picked my self up a few days ago. Its like she is disgusted with me, but why can't she just say that? Why can't she just say, you're great but I want to try something else. She is blatantly rude, short, and wants absolutely no closure. Up and gone.\nShe has only been with 3 guys that I know of, so this is really out of character.

Night shift finished at 6:45am in the morning, I was working with one other AIN. My coworker told my manager that *I* left a patient on a bedpan (she specifically used my name even though there were two of us on night shift). She told my manager that she found the patient on the bedpan after three hours.\n\nNow, the manager has dismissed this claim as ridiculous because (a) why was a patient left unattended for three hours, one of those hours was during breakfast time and (b) the patient in question can use her nurses' call bell if she needs help- she wouldn't just sit there for three hours on a bedpan.\n\nMy issue here is that I will presumably have to work with this woman at some stage and I don't even know how I should handle this, this has never happened to me before- I've never had someone lie about me to get me into trouble. I don't mind someone trying to get me into trouble for something that I have actually done wrong, but trying to get me into trouble for something I didn't do makes me feel sick to my stomach.\n\nHow should I approach her when I work with her? Should I bring it up? Should I pretend it didn't happen? Should I just introduce myself to her if I see her around? I can't just ignore her...\nTL;DR:"}

Not so little as a thanks came from this. I also didn't hear so much as a peep from them the entire time they lived there. They didn't want to hang out or spend time with me or our mutual friends. They pretty much had me move for them and dumped me until they needed me again.\n\nAnyway, no surprise, they asked me again to help them move, this time from the house to her mother's house. I agreed to move their bed since they don't have a truck, but left everything else behind and pretty much left it up to them. I told them I might be able to help more, but couldn't promise anything, and left it there, and they didn't come asking at all after I dropped the bed off.

He had never had an OkCupid account before. I naturally flipped out on him but kept my cool while at the restaurant.\n\nWhen we got back to his apartment I of course confronted him and tried to make him delete the app. He told me that he was using it to meet friends, and showed me his profile where it says \n\n>My self-summary\n>I just moved to the area and I know nobody. I'm just looking for friends. Sorry, if you're looking for something else, then move along.\n\nNow, the issue is that I know he used to be into the whole 'seduction' game and he posted on /r/seduction  more times than I will be comfortable with, but he stopped that in the past year.

There's a lot more history, but what's happening now is pressing. \n\nI found out last Friday she had a date. Apparently, I went and got plastered drunk out of sorrow and kept talking about it. That's probably because I know she's been starved for affection recently. She's been despairing that no man wants her, and I have no doubt she'll be all over this guy soon. \n\nMy question isn't about what to do in the long term, because I know I'll have to just get over her eventually. But right now, I really care for her. I want her to be happy, and I'm glad she's found someone, it just tears me apart that it's not me.\n\nI can get away from her for awhile, but I have to come back because we're officers in the same student organization, and we're both part of the music fraternity/sorority scene around here, so we can't really escape each other. I'm going to take a break anyway, but I'm facing a dilemma that I need to resolve quickly. \n\nI want to tell her how I feel, but I don't know if I should or not. I want to, but I'm not sure about whether it's actually a good idea or not. Like, if it will only crush any chance I still have, then I don't want to do it, on the hope that eventually I'll get another shot-which I won't hesitate with. But if she has a moral right to know, or if there's just nothing wrong, I want to, because I want the closure and relief of being able to tell her. \n\nIt's not really about getting over her. I just want to know what I should do with my feelings right now: bottle them up and lock them away, or express them? \n\nAll comments are welcome, additional information will be provided if necessary and asked-for.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been waiting for a good opportunity to talk to her but I never managed to pull it off (I'm super shy around her, especially with parents around). Our parents know each other and probably would like to see us together (my mom definitely would). Unfortunately, I've found out today, that she's leaving for college tomorrow, that's 6 hours away. She might be coming back for weekends and holidays, but she's going to stay there for the next 3 years. I feel really miserable now and I deeply regret not doing anything for such a long time.\n\nI haven't added her on FB yet because I wanted our first contact to be in person and now I see that was a mistake. I was wondering, however, whether it might be feasible to message her now, tell her what I feel and, at least, try to start a friendship. I don't want to hold her back when starting relationships or, God forbid, feel guilty for leaving. I am very happy for her that she was accepted, but, at the same time, I really wish she was still here.\nTL;DR:"}

So there is this girl that I received feelings for, most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my entire life, we share a whole bunch of interests and shes really sweet. So right at the beginning, 5 months ago, I started to message her through facebook. Got her number later and we started to text almost every night. She would text me first just about half of the time. She found out that I liked her through mutual friends but still talked to me, which is a good sign.\n\nI gained enough courage to ask her out for lunch, which she then did not reply for a day. After that I texted her \"So is that a no?\" and she replied with two paragraphs saying that she is sorry and that she is nervous when someone asks her out. Then I said \"Maybe instead when you're ready we could go to tims instead to get to know each other more?\" She agreed and said \"Sounds great!\"\n\nSo weeks pass on, we still are texting and I never talked to her in real life so I'm thinking that its been 5 months, it's about time we meet up. So I text her saying \"Hey, so do you think you're ready to go to tims next week so we can get to know each other a bit more:)?\" and then she never replies. She snaps me through snapchat just saying \"streak\" to keep our snapchat streak... but says nothing about me asking her to meet up. So I then snap her 2 days later saying \"Have you my text??\" and she opens it and never replies. She then starts snapping to me like nothing happened... This has been going on for a week and basically me asking her to meet up is out of the picture now. I really don't know what to do, I don't want to bring it up again because I feel like this time I am going to be totally rejected. Please reddit, help me):\nTL;DR:"}

Since moving into my SO's house last year I've been dismayed that he will never let me turn on the heat - never, no, not ever.\n\nI recently visited my parents in the Midwest and my dad said their heating bill every month was only about $80. He suggested we set our central heating to 60F and just let the house heat itself. I bet my SO that if we used the \"Hold Temp\" function on our system at a lower temperature we would have a much smaller bill than if we just turned the heat up whenever we were cold. I was wrong: last month our PG&E was $400. Here's the problem: everytime the heat kicks on, my SO turns it off. So when it gets cold (which it has been recently), I turn it on. Third roommate freaks out and turns it way up. So instead of never using it, we're constantly fussing with it.\n\nIs it true if we set the house to a low - but reasonable - temp, we will save money? Is it possible the inefficiency of an older central heating system won't help with this?\n\nSubmitted for all Redditors who are cold this winter - whether it's 5F inside your house or 50F.\nTL;DR:"}

My mom is very religious, like \" the holy ghost sends me messages\" religious. She was talking to herself while washing dishes. \"Mom, who are you talking to?\" She shoots me daggers and says \"I'm talking to Jesus\" ok mom. Jokingly I ask her \"So does he answer back?\" Again with the daggers, \"Yes he does, we talk all the time.\" Yeah ok mom. Me and my sister start laughing our asses off. \"Mom, are you crazy?\" I should not have said that. \"No I'm not crazy! Jesus is my saviour, and hopefully he'll come to you and save you too. One day he'll come to you in a dream and tell you that he's the god that talks to me.\" I love to fuck with my mother's head all the time because it's hilarious. \"Yeah ok, the only one who ever talks to me is Satan.\" I really regret saying that now. For some reason I rolled with it. \"WHAT?!\" \"Yeah, Satan is my best friend. He visits me in my dreams.\" I laughed maniacally and walked away. I thought that would be enough to notify her that I was joking. Nope. Next thing I know she's calling her mother and asking what to do. The next few days were weird. I started noticing things in my room were being moved around. My skull necklace was missing, and so were some of my Darren Shan books. Instead there was a \"teen\" bible and a children's book called \"Jesus loves me\". I have no idea where my books went, I'm guessing she threw them away. Today I came home from class and fell right asleep. I wake up to holy oil (she doesn't believe in holy water. Holy oil is just EVOO) on my forehead and her praying over me. I told her to get off of me, but she just said \"shh, I'm healing you\" I'm guessing she was referring to the fact that I'm really depressed because of college and my SAD. Apparently mood disorders are signs of demonic influence. Now I bet she's telling everyone at church, and they'll be bribing me to go with cupcakes.\nTL;DR:"}

We grew up in a alcoholic, drug-fueled, abusive household. He was 13 when we were moved out of our house and into other family members' homes. We were separated, but remained somewhat close.*\n\nNow we are in our 30s. My brother has struggled with substance abuse since his teens. He has been in and out of rehab, mental facilities, jail. Every time I think he is getting his shit together, something happens - loses his job, can't pay his rent, etc. \n\nWe have helped him out with his rent a couple times before. A few months ago he loses his job and his rent is behind yet again. He was already living in an apartment that was way out of his financial means, but chose to stay there. We gave him a game plan (find a new place, dammit!) and help him with his rent one last time. We didn't want him to get evicted as that would have made it hard for him to find a place in the future.\n\nNow here we are a couple months later. He is getting evicted. Still living in the same expensive apartment. His part time job gives him enough money to pay the rent with absolutely no money leftover. He has a food card, so he can still afford to eat. Instead of giving what he can to the property manager right when he gets paid, he buys a case of beer and smokes (according to a friend of his).\n\nFinancially, we are done - that's a given. Emotionally and mentally, I can't get over this guilt/need to help. I know I shouldn't feel this way as I didn't cause this situation, but I do. Is there anything I can say or do to help? Is this a lost cause?\nTL;DR:"}

A great person, very kind. We've known each other for over a year and I adore him.\n\nI know I have oral HSV. I believe I got it from kissing an ex who was asymptomatic. I had three outbreaks in rapid succession two years ago and haven't had any since. \n\nKnowing that I have the virus has affected me terribly. I take a lysine supplement and I don't eat chocolate, nuts, or shellfish. I can't look at myself in the mirror because I'm scared of what I might see. I have told my potential BF that I have the virus and he said that he doesn't think it will be a big deal. For the first month or so of seeing each other we didn't kiss much, which I was fine with because I was so anxious. But now we've started kissing more, and it's as thrilling as it is frightening. \n\nI would be devastated to give it to him. We live by the beach and he loves spending time in the sun, which I know is a trigger for the virus. It would kill him if he couldn't enjoy the outdoors like he's used to. He's been sexual with only two other women. He divorced his wife a couple years ago because she was unfaithful a lot and with multiple men. Statistically, I figure his cheating exwife probably exposed him to the virus from being with her various lovers, but we can't know for sure. He's never had a fever blister to his knowledge.\n\nI guess I am wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and what ended up happening? I know everyone's situation is different, but the last thing I want to do is give him the virus and he has an outbreak, especially after all the bullshit he went through with his exwife. I want us to have a stress free, trusting relationship; something he didn't have before, but it's hard when I feel like a ticking time bomb.\nTL;DR:"}

I am a college student. This summer I decided to attend summer session and needed a place to stay. I found a room in an apartment for less than 500 dollars (the person (Person A) I was renting from said that they would pay half the rent so that I could afford it). Since most people leave the town I am in for summer, there's low demand and a surplus of housing so it's not unheard of for people to sublease for so little. I was to stay in the lofted part of the apartment, though it's specified in their lease that no one is to say up there. (So they are already in violation of the lease)\n\nThe renter and I agreed on a price. They said they told the landlord and that I was approved to stay there. She said the landlord would email me a contract to sign. I never heard from the landlord or signed any contract. It was merely arranged through Facebook chat. \n\nAfter a month of living there, I received verbal permission from one of the year round renters (who wasn't subleasing) to bring my kitten to live in the apartment. After having the cat for a month, BOOM fleas. It didn't make sense. The cat had never had fleas prior to moving into the apartment. It had never gone outside and it was dosed with flea meds monthly. I was later told by my renter that pets weren't allowed but by that point the animal was already living with us and, at the time, I couldn't take it anywhere else. I sent it to a friend's house as soon as I as able.I then flea-bombed the place and moved out two weeks early because I had finally found a place to live.\n\nNow the renters want me to pay for extermination ($700) and cover the cost of furniture ($300) that they \"had to throw out\". They also want the last month's rent ($450), which is fine. I'm willing to pay that. \n\nDo they have grounds for a law suit? Should I pay them? What should I say to them, if anything?\nTL;DR:"}

So here's the deal.\nMy boyfriend has just gotten a new job, but before this he had been unemployed for 15 months due to his anxiety. \nI know he's trying very hard, but his uncertainty is what is making him anxious. (Uncertainty about if he'll be able to keep the job, as well as feeling like a burden on me since I'm working to support us both). He won't get paid for another month due to his new job's lack of organisation so he's feeling the pressure as I have to pay for all bills etc.\nIt gets to a point with his anxiety that he will isolate himself in another room because there is \"less to worry about\" in there and he can just focus on himself. Meanwhile I know that he's crying and having a panic attack and that I feel helpless. \nI do try to talk to him about it, and he has booked an appointment to see the doctor and will start counselling in a month. But for the time being, I feel like I'm either making matters worse or at least not helping at all. But I don't want him to isolate or try to hide his anxiety since I can see it straight away.\nAll in all, any advice for those who have been in my situation? I don't know how to support him when he gets like this.\nTL;DR:"}

When interview time comes, I've been in debate about how to approach a particular condidtion I have.\n\nI am ridculously sensative to fluorescent lights (including compact fluorescent bulbs).  They give me migraines.  Head pounding, crawl in a dark closet, curl into the fetus postion and pray for death inbetween vomitting, migraines.  Depending on various factors, I've had them last anywhere from 4 hours to 4 days, but I've kept them pretty well under control for the past year, and only had a couple of serious attacks (both less than a day).  This was accomplished mainly by avoiding fluorescent lights.\n\nI have some special sunglasses that I wear for quick trips to the store, but I would never be able to spend an entire day in an office lit by fluorescent lights.  I would require a separate space that is either lit by incandescant or LED lighting.\n\nI'm in debate about whether or not I should bring this up during the intial interview.  \n\nIf I bring it up, I am concerned that I would be taken out of consideration over worry that I would be excessively ill or concern that they wouldn't be able to accomidate me.  I don't want the interviewer to be thinking more about the freak with the the light problem rather than assessing me as a candidate for the position.\n\nIf I don't bring it up initially, I wouldn't want to be perceived as a liar, and still taken out of consideration for the job.\n\nTo tell or not to tell, that is the question.\nTL;DR:"}

My family went out to eat at a nice non-chain Italian Restaurant, with middle of the road pricing, that is a nice place to go for Father's Day. There was a family sitting next to us and they were having a great time, seemed to enjoy the server (which was also ours - she was great), liked their meal, etc... When they got up to leave they handed their kid the tip money and had him give it to the waitress (he was about 13). As they were walking out the kid goes, here's your tip, and held out the money and gave her 5 bucks. She smiled and graciously accepted and said thanks so much. Our meal was a little over $70 and we didn't have drinks (we are water drinkers) or dessert . They had much more food then us, sodas on the table, wine, etc... so their bill must have been at least $100 (guessing). It made me wonder, is it right to go out to eat at a nice restaurant when the servers are expecting a tip as it is their primary source of income?

We were a seemingly oddly perfect match. We shared almost all the same interests, same morbid and offensive sense of humor, hell we even looked similar aside from height. We were in a relationship for a year and then she dumped me so she could pursue someone else. I dont hold a grudge because i understand long distance relationships dont have a high success rate.\n\n     Pretty much since she left me i have felt an overwelming emptiness that other women cant match up to. Ive been in 2 relationships since and i just havent felt that \"wow, she is perfect\" feeling. i go through them without feeling genuine fufillment. I want to believe i will feel that amazing feeling again but i have a worry that i just took the first breakup so hard that it made me cold.\nTL;DR:"}

She previously explained to me that the classes were $10/each, and I would be invoiced after the fact by the studio, which was great and very convenient for me in terms of being able to pay. \n\n*Today:*\nI messaged her this morning to ask about participating in upcoming classes, and she told me that she had it wrong initially and that to continue classes I would have to pay upfront for either a 5- or 10-class package as per studio rules. I told her that I would have to get back to her about that (holidays coming up and all), and she later texted me to let me know that she was getting me a Pilates package as part of my Christmas gift. \n\n*Why I'm posting:*\nI don't know if that's weird or not, so I'm looking for some objectivity. I've really enjoyed the three classes I've already taken with her and our family member, but I really don't know how I feel about being gifted her services as part of my gift. Is it similar to being a chef and making a dish as a gift for someone?  I love her dearly, and part of me just thinks her reasoning was she knew paying upfront would be difficult for me and knows how much I've enjoyed going so far, but I thought I'd ask to see if I'm missing anything.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Trying to get a mortgage and found out about an old charge-off/collection. Need advice on how to handle.\nPOST: My wife and I are looking to buy a house. We applied and found out that my wife still has an old charge-off/collection from 2010 showing on her credit report. I spoke with our potential mortgage company, and they said that in order to proceed with the application, it would have to get taken care of. Little back story. My wife was married previously. When her and her ex-husband divorced, her financial situation fell apart. She could no longer make payments on her auto which was financed with United Federal Credit Union. Her checking account was also through United and the payment was auto-drafted. The end result was her checking account ended up overdrawn $600 and they repossessed the car and auctioned it. This resulted in a deficiency of $4412.57 that was charged off and sold to Evergreen (collector). My wife called Evergreen to try and start the process of negotiating a settlement. They told her the following. They will accept: $4444.57 ----and the account will be closed $4060.46-----paid in full $3530.05-----settled in full He said that most lenders will not accept settled in full He said he could try to knock it in half but it would only be considered settled. The account will not be marked as closed. We can't afford to pay this amount, especially on a debt that is nearing it's SOL (We are in Arkansas where it is 5 years). We could use advice on someone who has gone through something similar because we don't know how to proceed. We can afford to pay a lump sum of $1,100-$1,300 which is 25-30% of the original balance, but don't want to do that if it won't end up helping our situation as it would deplete our down payment fund on the house.\nTL;DR:"}

We invariably are court partners when possible, and chat before, during, and after class.  Our interactions have been flirty and friendly, and he seems to be interested.  I find myself inordinately excited for tennis class, just because I get to see him.\n\nI invited him to come with me to a women's varsity tennis match this past weekend (we get extra credit in the class for this) but he was busy.  He expressed interest in instead going to the next home match, which isn't until the beginning of April.  Frankly, I would like to get things moving a little more quickly, as I don't want this to go into the friend zone and then fizzle at the end of the semester.\n\nThe class is only twice a week, and is early in the morning.  To compound the difficulty, I don't have time to stay and chat with him after class as I have to rush to my next class.  We are facebook friends, but I kind of dislike facebook and he only checks his every 2-3 days.\n\nSo, my question is, should I ask him out on a legit date?

Later in the same conversation, she said that this weekend, her friends are trying to set her up with some guy (who had already graduated, but wants to go to the prom for some reason), and if they get along nicely, she's going to go with him.\n\nNow this came across as weird for a number of reasons. When she was telling me her friends were setting her up, she almost sounded disappointed and apathetic. I imagine this would have been a great time to ask her out, but I decided to let her run her mouth while I nodded and smiled, heh. Another part of me thinks that, by her openly telling me about her plans to meet up with the guy for the weekend, it was her way of subtly telling me she wasn't interested.\n\nAbove everything though, this girl is really cool. Totally girlfriend material. It would really suck if I did ask her to prom, only to find out she's still considering not going/already committed with that other guy (or at least committed enough to give him a chance).\n\nSo my plan is to ask her later this week, and pretty much tell her that I'm really tired of high school drama bs and that we should just have a lot of fun. I am almost convinced this is the right move, but should I worry that she already apparently has plans to meet some other guy?\nTL;DR:"}

People cheated on me though, but that's in the past.\n\nRight now I'm in my best relationships so far and my current girlfriend is great - I basically have almost nothing to wish for despite some interest differences but I'm uncertain if it matters that much. \n\nAnd yet I cannot help thinking about sex with other girls - not relationships, not love, just sex, and just for a change. Every time I see a beauty out on the street or at work or online I start daydreaming about having a sexual intercourse with her.\n\nI have tried masturbating (yeah, *furiously*) in hopes that it would provide me with the experience/emotions I seek, but it's been not much good so far.\n\nI suppose a lot of men would consider this normal (natural polygamy and all that) but the feeling is new to me. What should I do? If I fall for it, will I be able to look her in the eyes or think about myself the same way? Perhaps I should talk to her about this? She's pretty open in this sense (we even thought of doing a threesome someday).\n\nI thought that someone older or with more experience, someone who went through the same, could share a helpful advice with me.\nTL;DR:"}

We have a very...connected relationship, and me staying home while he travels is not an option.  So, since he'll be getting a raise from his current job (and the travel will usually be within a few states from home), we've decided that we're going to buy tickets for me each time he goes on a trip.\n\nAs it is, I don't make much money; I'm a part-time receptionist and I only bring in about $800 a month.  But while his raise will pretty much cover the money that I won't be making, there's still the issue of the plane tickets.  Now, it's not IMPOSSIBLE for us to make this work without any income from me, but it should would be a HELL of a lot easier if I could make even a couple hundred dollars a month (after all, we do have a wedding to pay for next summer).\n\nI've thought of a couple ideas of how I might earn money, but none of them would bring in a sure, steady income, and they all would take a little while to get going.  Feel free to skip this paragraph if you don't care what I've been thinking of thus far!  I was an English literature major in college, and we've tossed around the idea of me starting up a book review blog and eventually putting ads on the site to bring in a little money.  I'm also fairly crafty, so there's been thoughts about making handmade things and selling them on Etsy or something, but...that just doesn't bring in a lot.  It takes a long time to make things and there's only so much you can reasonably sell them for.  I've also recently become interested in developing applications for Windows Phones, but since I don't have a background in programming, etc. it's going to take me quite a while before I can actually make any money off of it.\n\nAny thoughts?  I know a lot of money-making ideas depend on the person and the skills they have, but I'm willing to listen to anything at this point!\nTL;DR:"}

They would both go hours or even days without talking to me or replying to texts (I'm not the clingy type either) so I was always waiting for their contact in anticipation and pretty much had anxiety attacks. This new guy I've been seeing for a month is the opposite! He texts everyday telling me what he's up to, and calls me at least once a day. He's the most handsome guy I've ever been with, has the same music taste as me (the other guys liked completely different things, and I'd always force myself to to like it), does the cheesy things I always saw in rom coms and dreamed of etc. \n\nThe problem is, my heart doesn't rush when I see his name on my phone, or just him in person. The only thing I know I hate about him is how he always says he's tired/sick. I don't know if I'm pulling myself back because I'm scared of someone actually liking me, or if I'm not attracted to him because he doesn't challenge me.

I, too, criticize people, but I feel I criticize people that are hateful towards me and others. I don't really criticize strangers or people I feel are harmless and kind.\n\nLong story short (or not so short), I hung out with two friends/roommates for the first time in awhile. I felt super irritated when my roommates would bring up this certain other friend and speak negatively of her. I know this certain friend is overall a nice person and works hard in order to apply for medical school, yet my roommates only speak ill of her and one of them even said \"my sister doesn't like her and hasn't even met her!\" I know the reason for this is because my roommate speaks negatively of this certain friend to the sister. They totally badmouth this girl, also calling her na\u012bve and saying they can't believe she is going to be a doctor. It irritates me! They talk shit about other people, yet they also have flaws.\n\nFor example:\n-Roommate calls these two guys \"too religious,\" yet she herself is a practicing Jew that regularly says prayers and goes to temple.\n-Other roommate calls the people in our early-start medical program \"trash.\" I know the reason for this is because she used to be pre-med, but could not pass the pre-reqs for it. This roommate also preaches about being nice to other people and how she thinks people are mean to her, yet she can be vicious to other people. \n\nHow can I personally deal with it? I want to confront them because it's unfair for them to say these things, but they are rooming with me for the next year. I don't want bitterness.

I didn't have my car at that time and I was too embarrassed to ask go up to a random house to ask them if I can use their washroom. So, I called my dad to come pick me up.

Turns out that my friends that I was playing soccer with have all seen me take a crap. They all saw it falling down my pants. And one of my friends decided to take a picture of the aftermath of my crap beside the school. They all laughed it off and now I am 18 and they still remember it. So every time we want to go play football again, they all remind me to bring a diaper with me :) By the way, I latter found out that when I was running up the stairs at home, some of my crap fell on the stairs, and my mom stepped on it.

Previously, I haven't been very engaged with the girls I've dated, and leaving was done pretty much overnight. Almost always it's ended with us not being friends anymore, primarily since I never give a good enough reason for breaking up. \n\nThis time it's different however. The girl I'm with is extremely manipulating and I am a big pushover nice-guy. In short; we own an apartment and a dog together, so I can't just pack up and leave like before. \n\nRelationship-masters of Reddit; How do I end a relationship gracefully like a mature adult? \n\nBackstory: \nThe problem I'm having is that I don't really have a good reason to give her that won't be offensive to her. The core problem (or cancer) of the relationship is her lack of interest in me, and the fact that she uses me to supplicate her every need. I have to go shopping because she can't carry the shopping bags, I have to walk the dog because she is tired / sick / feet hurt / headache / whatever, She gets to decide whenever we're having sex, and whenever we do, which is eyebrow-risening seldom, it's a big bucket of boredom. I also do all the cooking, primarily because she sucks at it, but secondary because she wringles her way out of it. She's been using me for her every desire while giving me absolutely nothing in return and it's simply gone far enough. \n\nHowever.. If I ask her: \"Are you happy in the relationship?\", her reply will of course be \"Yes, of course i am\". She has no reason not to be. If she asks me and i say anything of the reasons above.. well, then she has all kinds of great ways to make me feel guilty about myself.\nTL;DR:"}

We've become friends too, but I'm hesitant to get too close because I feel like she has a lot of unresolved emotional issues (don't want to say too much because she is a redditor and might see this post). I've been bugging her to find a therapist, but like I said, we're not too close so I don't push it too much.

I'm not looking for anything serious any time soon: I'm not really in that phase of life.

We'll usually hang out beforehand, and she's been a lot more PDA with me than she was in the past. I've reminded her a couple times that I'm not interested in a relationship, and she always says that she isn't either right now (she's been sleeping with a lot of other guys too). But last week she also started complimenting me in a way that made me feel a little uncomfortable, and I'm worried that she is falling for me. While the sex is fantastic, I have zero interest in a relationship with her.\n\nSo, the question: is it wrong for me to keep hooking up with her if I suspect this? Do I have an obligation to try getting her to see a therapist?

(Corpus Christi, TX)\nPOST: My Brother went through a messy divorce the last year. He went over to his Ex-Wifes house, threatened to kill himself and she said he pointed the gun at her. She called the cops and told them he threatened her and was going to kill himself.  Cops came, he admitted to it and they took him in on a \"Mental Health Warrant\". He was released early after speaking with a doctor there for all of 10 minutes. Two weeks later he broke into his ex-wifes house and tried to kill himself with sleeping pills/booze. He was taken to the ER and was in ICU for 3 days because the Pysch Ward was full (He was physically fine, he threw up the pills and they just had him in the ICU because the hospital is dumb)  3 days in the ICU cost him about 14k pre-insurance (once again no surgeries or anything was done, they just gave him an IV of saline the first day and then valium after that) Now he's getting a 4k medical bill for basically sitting on his ass for 3 days. Clearly this dude wasn't right in the head. Is the Pysch ward doctor liable for releasing him early after doing a poor job of evaluating his mental health (He talked with the doctor for 10 minutes max) ?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My cat managed to catch a baby mouse, but I saved it before it was killed. I put it back, together with his mouse sibling, in what I think was their underground construction. May I have done something wrong?\nPOST: I need mouse experts now. Backstory: My three cats were in the garden when something caught their interest. Before I could see what they were doing, the youngest caught a mouse. First I thought it was a spider, but  then I could see a little mouse head sticking out of his mouth. He immediately brought it to the next carpet and placed it on the ground. I then first saw it was very young, its eyes hardly open, but with fur already. I carefully took it away from him (he managed to hit it once again because he`s a dick sometimes) and then placed it in the bed where he found it. I brought all cats back in to see if the mouse was hurt. It didn't really move for about 45 minutes. I found another baby mouse quite close to him during that time and put them close together. They quickly got close to each other and fell asleep under a leaf. After a little internet research I took both of them and dropped them in a 6 inch deep vertical hole which assume was their underground construction. I couldn't see them well, but I think they walked into a small tunnel.\n\nThe mice [looked similar to this] They were probably of [this kind] I assumed the entrance of their tunnel was the right one, and not just a vertical hole, after seeing [this picture](\nOne was carried away, but saved [from this guy](\n\nSo, may I have done some mistakes, for example touching the mice? If they are in their tunnel now, will they get \"picked up\" by their mouse parents, or could it be that they do not accept them anymore? No adult mice showed up as long as they were outside. Why could it be that baby mice are outside their tunnel?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by not taking care of myself for a few months.\nPOST: This fuck up began about 2 months ago, when I managed to get myself my first job. I thought it was going to be an easy job, just stacking shelves. Boy was I wrong, I have to do almost everything in the store except heavy cleaning. My hours are at strange times and I'm worked very hard. I normally cycle to work which is about 5 kilometers away, all this exercise and strenuous work began to take its affect, without me even knowing it.\n\nFast forward to earlier today. I had stayed at my girlfriends flat in Edinburgh overnight. We were on our way to the train station so I could go home. But an interesting thing to note about myself is that if my blood sugar is low, I feel like absolute shit. It happens all the time and eating some high calorie food normally perks me right up. And so on this delightful morning on our way to the train station I began to feel pretty bad. So i stopped at a small bakery and had a doughnut and a slice of pizza. Just as I was leaving the bakery my body suddenly had a large spasm and I got a little bit of a fright. But I brushed it off and kept walking. We passed the iconic Greyfriars Bobby and that's the last thing I remember. I woke up in the middle of the road with my girlfriend crying and a paramedic looming over me. I was very confused. He then informed me that I had taken a seizure in the middle of the road. And I, in my state of confusion and hunger asked where my pizza was, trust me to be that guy. I was taken to the hospital and I waited for the usual NHS waiting times and was eventually told that they didn't know what happened to me, but they think it was my low blood sugar.\n\nThis is where my work comes into play. Apparently I have been pushing my body too hard. Going without breakfast and lots of vigorous exercise had led to my body crashing after one night of no sleep  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)    and hardly any food. So there's a lesson for all you other lazy people out there, always make sure you are eating and taking care of your body.\nTL;DR:"}

She said that me saying that made her feel stupid and that I don't recognize when she's trying to do nice things for me. When I try to talk to her about these things she just says she'll get over it and doesn't like talking about it. However she will be very rude to me sometimes and it's supposed to be ok because that's just the way she is, but because I'm the \"nice one\" I'm held responsible for the things I do.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22F] with my BF [22M] 5 years duration, Might be showing signs of dumping me suddenly, has anger issues, need advice\nPOST: Ok, so I've been dating this guy, (we'll call him Paul) for 5 years. I totally adore him, he is smart, funny, ridiculously attractive, and I don't think I've met anyone else more perfect for me. He's been really supportive through a lot of terrible shit in my life.\n However, his temper is a huge issue, and possibly a deal breaker. He suddenly gets mad about small stupid stuff, and often belittles me personally to win the argument. He is totally incapable of apologizing or saying when he's wrong, and he doesn't even understand why he gets so mad but when he decides to pick a fight he sticks it to the end. \n\nSo recently, he took the LSAT, and the past year of studying and stress have been hell, but I've tried to push through because it's a stressful time so I've been really forgiving of his behavior. He got his results back a week ago, and they were definitely subpar, so now he has to take it again. He's been on the warpath since he got the results, and last night we got into this huge argument and i'm not sure there's a recovery tbh.\n\nSo it started because I was on the phone, asked him to hold on a second, spoke to someone else, and got back on the phone. This, for some reason, set him off about how i don't respect him, and it turned into a whole argument where he called me all kinds of really horrible insulting names, like a fucking maniac and a crazy deluded cunt, and even insulted my looks. \n\nHe knows that i don't have a lot of family support and all our friends are mutual friends who will definitely take his side. He often uses that against me in arguments, and btw, this has happened before (he dumped me the last time he took the LSAT, for about three days and then reached out to me and we got back together.) So far it's been two days since the argument. I don't know what to do. Should I reach out to him? Should i even date him after what he's said?\nTL;DR:"}

Now we work together.\nPOST: We would argue a lot about small things and I think this is what eventually led to us breaking up. I was caught off guard, but I should've seen the signs. She wasn't happy, and neither was I. I believe that there's a lot I could have done that might have made things different, but it's too late for that now and I have to accept that she might be moving on.\n\nFor the first few days after the breakup, I wouldn't leave her alone. I would plea with her to talk with me and try to work things out. I came to the conclusion that if we were going to have a future ( and even if we weren't ) I had to give her space. For two weeks we didn't talk. We saw eachother once in passing and we didn't speak. When I got ahold of her I let her know that I was interested in having coffee or lunch and she told me she wasn't ready to hang out. \n\nAfter that I decided that I need to try no contact again. However, I go to work the following Monday and she's training for a position in the same office as me. We go to the same school, so we might run in to each other anyway, but now we're basically forced to interact.\n\nOur old relationship is over, and I was at first devastated by this, but maybe it's a good things. Some elements of that relationship were definitely unhealthy. My concern is about the future. Moving forward, how do I balance no contact with working together? I'm not trying to salvage our old relationship, but I've been working on improving myself and I'm hoping we can build a new relationship. \n\nSome sort of reconciliation would be nice, at the very least, but I think if we both own our pasts and plan for the future then we can have a better relationship than ever. I can provide missing details.\n\nThoughts? Advice? Thank you.\nTL;DR:"}

I was worried that my libido wasn't what it should be, so I went off of Prozac about 2 weeks ago.  Fast forward to tonight and during an intense make out session where she was grinding on me, I had an orgasm (i'm fucking cringing just typing this, fuck me).  Anyway, I was really embarrassed and apologized profusely, but she took it really badly.  She found it extremely disgusting, like I was some kind of pervert, and basically asked me to leave shortly thereafter.\n\nI'm really broken up about it.  I didn't mean to do it, and I immediately went back on to Prozac so it won't happen again. I told her about the medication and why I think it happened since I was used to the side effect of genital numbness from the Prozac, but she became even more upset that I had been on an antidepressant and never told her I had been depressed.  She told me that I should leave since it was late anyway and I asked if we could do something another time so that I could make it up to her and she said she needed time to think about it.\n\nNeither of us are very sexually experienced if that matters.  I don't know what to do, I'm kind of drunk right now and I'm really fucking sad because I liked this woman and I feel like I have completely fucked things up without meaning to.\nTL;DR:"}

A girlfriend of mine on the floor thought it was just him being him, and I kind of took her word for it.

I don't know when you go from giving someone space to talking about feelings. Ya see, I've never had this happen with someone I lived with.

We met through mutual friends and I asked her to accompany me as a as a \"date\" to a wedding, expecting to be nothing more than friends and didn't take it too seriously. To make a long story short, we had an amazing time together. I ended up sleeping over at her place that night. We fooled around a little but didn't have sex (which I am happy about--a girl that fucks on the first date isn't usually good relationship material and has low self-esteem, in my experience anyway).\n\nI had to leave the following day (this past Sunday) and return home. I live about 2 hours away.\n\nFor the most part, I'm a pretty typical guy, but with a weird streak (like everyone here on Reddit). I'd consider myself a bit quirky, but nothing too strange. This girl is a bit more quirky than I--she is the artsy type, and somewhat of a hippie. This is probably the reason I don't quite know what to do. Most girls I've dated have been more average in their personalities than me, which eventually left me bored.\n\nBasically what I'm wondering here is how to play my next move. Should I text her and tell her again what an awesome time I had and that I'd like to see her again? Or should I not contact her until I'm in her town in a week and a half to see our mutual friends? I don't want to scare her away by telling her how much I like her and creep her out, but I also don't want to play it off and make her think I don't like her at all.\n\nSo, what would Reddit do?\nTL;DR:"}

About 8 or 9 months ago, we started flirting pretty heavily and she would often talk about how we were going to get married and all sorts of lovey-dovey stuff. At the time I was lonely and I liked to think about that sort of thing, so I considered it and played along, but admittedly I was never serious about it. I never communicated that to her. That is where I fucked up and the root cause of the issue.\n\nFast forward to now, I haven't talked to her in about 6 months, and I have a new girlfriend who has been in Europe for a while, and she will be back in a couple of weeks. I really want to talk to her about this, but wifi is hard to find and she won't be able to talk to me for a few days. \n\nSo here's the problem. The girl I knew from high school just texted me saying that she picked out a ring and a wedding venue out of the blue. I have always been pretty bad at communicating with women how I feel about them, so with my current girlfriend I changed all of that and laid it all out from the start. We talk about our feelings all the time and it is refreshing.\n\nSo here is my question: Since I have no interest in this other girl, do I message her back (I would be very clear about my mistakes because I want to hold myself accountable for leading her on in the past) or do I ignore her? I don't know what to do and the fact that she messaged me about marrying me out of the blue has got me very freaked out. If I should say something to her, how would I go about it? How do I tell her that I never really thought the marriage thing was serious? I am fairly new to dealing with these sorts of issues. Thanks in advance for any advice.\nTL;DR:"}

This obviously annoys her but she doesn't exactly have a stellar track record of being right and has come out with some downright ridiculous assertions. For example she once asked or asserted (I don't recall) that jesus existed before dinorsaurs (she's not super religious or anything btw - just a lack of basic general knowledge and/or brain-farts).\n\nShe knows she says stupid things some times and her friends used to (and presumably still do) tease her about it some times. Even granting that these silly assertions might be (and are sometimes) a simple lapse in judgement/general knowledge, it does not exactly lend weight to her credibility in any future assertions. Despite this she doesn't like that I don't usually trust her opinion. I can't blame her, despite the above she's obviously not always wrong and at times it transpires that she was right about something but I didn't believe her. But she doesn't seem to care for proving her points in the same way as I do. She doesn't look for/demand proof but rather accepts things. I don't know how better to explain it - the above is by no means a concise summary of the situation but that's the best I can do for now. Any suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 23[M] and I'm very desperate for some objective advice on how to handle my situation.\n\n- Obvious one out of the way first: extreme social anxiety and a bit of depression has left me with about 2 \"friends\" and I barely (want to) speak to them. To be honest, they just keep me around because they feel bad for me or something. (Overheard this.)\n\n- My parents and I barely speak anymore since I moved out. They were always fairly abusive and manipulative so they didn't like when they couldn't 'abuse' me whenever they wanted.\n\n- I was recently fired due to being an 'inadequate' employee, this despite being pretty much the top employee of the company for about a year. I was one in a batch of 12 fired employees who were, seemingly overnight, 'inadequate.' No explanation, just a pink slip. \n\n- The school I applied for last month called me this morning to notify me that I'm not being accepted. They had me take 2 tests (I scored 96% and 87%) and I had a pretty good talk with the head admin about my peculiar school history (I hadn't gone to school for about 4 years due to medical reasons). They even unofficially showed me the 'you-are-accepted' document which they signed in front of me. Now whenever I call them and mention my name, their administrative department is 'busy.'\n\n- Student debt. Behind on rent. The usual financial shit.\n\n- I barely do something for 'myself', like a hobby or a skill to master. I'm so used to just working fulltime that I don't have any time for me. Now I have too much time and I don't know what to do except push out resumes and go job/schoolhunting.\n\n- My girlfriend and I are having some relationship issues. I know, I know, I should go over to /r/Relationship_Advice for this one but it's just worth noting that on the love-end of things, it isn't peachy either.\nTL;DR:"}

We went with it and enjoyed the night because, why would he lie about that?\n\nFast forward a few months. I'm seeing this girl that has lived here(Quebec) her whole life.

I set up to deposit $500 per paycheck ($1000 a month) into my savings account.

These kids come through to pay for their food completely wasted. I look into their backseat and see something that looks very familiar to me. A second look confirms it to be mine. It was a photo holder like [this] My friend had made it for me in the 8th grade with carebear fabric and little bear buttons where the ribbons crossed. I asked them if they had just come from the Sunflower house and they said \"uh yeah, why?\" and I said \"because that photo board in your backseat is mine and you stole it from my house\". They just burst out laughing and passed it to me through the window without so much as apologizing and drove off. I wasn't really upset because of how funny it was. My door was locked when I got home, so I'm still not sure how they got it.\n\nAnother story: I was at a concert at the very front and a lot of people were crowd-surfing. At some point a very drunk person with huge boots on was crowd-surfing and flayling the whole time for some reason, he kicked me in the face and knocked my glasses off and I couldn't find them. Pissed me off so when the security guard put him down I punched him in the arm and called him an asshole, I almost got pulled out for that. He just turned around and looked at me really confused.\n\nThe very next night I was at a house party and telling that story, some guy turns around and says \"hey that was me, you totally punched me last night!!

Happiest i've been for ages - didn't get to see her as much as i'd like, but I was really keen on her. Was a bit annoyed that she was going away for the weekend last friday, stupidly got really drunk, went out and kissed a girl in a club. And like, 2 of her mates saw. Didn't realise at the time. Figured i'd let her know about it before they did, texted her saying what happened the morning after. She blanked me all weekend, then met me in a bar on monday, where she was sitting with some of her mates (Clearly been gossiping about it - women, huh). She broke it off, I hadn't really prepared anything to say. Guess it was naive of me to think she'd forgive me. I was her first proper boyfriend, and I realise in retrospect how much I betrayed her trust.\n\nAt the time I had an essay to write pretty urgently, so I tried to push it out of my mind. Would have got an extension but I don't think 'heartbreak' is a valid excuse. I've seen the new girl a few times this week - she's also really nice, but I don't think she's up for a relationship. Anyway she's probably a bit wary because i'm clearly rebounding. Had a bit of time to reflect on it today now that i've finished all my work, realised how upset I am about it. Seeing this other girl has helped, but I can't brush away my feelings for the ex that easily. Meant to be going for a drink with my ex tomorrow. Not really sure what to do. Is it unrealistic of me to think I can win her back? Another thing - she's chinese, so i'm guessing loyalty is a big thing for her.\nTL;DR:"}

We moved in together when we got engaged and spend most of our time together. \n\nWe're both in very demanding fields and the stress level is high. We both have to take work home with us. I can tolerate the stress pretty well, but he has been struggling with both the workload and the high expectations of the job. We both also have student loans from undergrad, with his being a little bit higher, so he is not willing to switch fields due to how much longer and how much more money it would take to retrain. It's a very specialized field so it would be hard to transition to any equally (or slightly lower) paying job. \n\nHe's really taking any flaws in his work personally and hates his job. He's also lashing out at every little thing and often angry, which is often a manifestation of depression in men. That and his talk about how little he wants to live and several other signs makes me think that he has depression. I've urged him to go see a therapist, if not a psychiatrist (since he doesn't want to take meds), but he's refused by saying that therapy doesn't work on him. His view is that therapy doesn't work unless you believe that it can and he also doesn't want to put in the mental effort. \n\nI'm pretty exhausted from constantly having to sympathize and calm him down. I'm a well-adjusted person, but even I have limits to how much extra emotional weight I'm willing to take on.

Then we broke up when i went to college because she said she couldn't handle the 45 minute distance. A few months later she told me she made a mistake and we started on and off seeing each other. I was interested in forming a relationship and so was she. She told me she was really busy with her life and wouldn't have time to focus on a relationship until summer.\n\nFast-forward, it's now summer and she told me she won't have time at all for a relationship, that I would be her last priority and that she thinks we won't work out anyways. I was strung along by my best friend and it really hurts. For months, I was just waiting for her to be ready for me\n\nI think we are a little too different and our goals have changed since we met when we were younger, but when she told me all of this, she didn't seem upset and almost as she's thought about this for a while but didn't mind keeping me around when she needed me. \n\nI'm trying to go no contact and we haven't spoken sense but she is putting pictures of her and another guy on snapchat, I assume because she knows i'll check and see it. It hurts that she seemingly moved on so fast and wasn't even upset that we were't going to be apart of each others lives.\n\nI know I shouldn't have let her string me along but I was clinging to hope I guess. My question is how do you get over someone you were so close with but who also didn't treat you well down the stretch?\n\nHow do I get past this? Thanks everyone.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [21/m] and I think the girl I'm seeing [18/f] wants me to consider an open relationship\nPOST: Hey all,\n\nSo I've been seeing this girl for almost two months now, and things have been going very well. Physically and emotionally I'm connecting and I really enjoy her company. Things have been moving in a more serious direction as of late, with me wanting to be in a committed relationship. When I've brought the subject up previously she's just kind of brushed it off and said she doesn't know me quite well enough yet, but we talked again last night and she told me that she was concerned that while she was attracted to me in the same way, she has a tendency to want to fuck a lot of people.\n\nThe way she explained it was that she's very much physically attracted to me and emotionally as well, but in past relationships she's had with guys, she'll find someone who she wants to have sex with and do so, then go back to being with her significant other. Not in an intimate way with the other guy, mind you, more of a once-and-done thing. It also isn't that her significant other isn't able to please her; it's that she likes experiencing sex with different partners.\n\nI've never really been in a relationship where my partner and I weren't exclusively committed to each other. I think ideally that is what I want to have, but I'm not sure that that's just me regurgitating what is socially accepted, because the more I think about it, the more I realize I'd be okay with her sleeping with someone else, as long as it wasn't an intimate thing for her. I don't really have the desire to be with anyone else when I'm attracted to someone, but I think I could respect someone who feels differently and still maintain a relationship with them, as long as we had some pretty clear boundaries. I definitely trust this girl; she has absolutely no need to tell me all this stuff. I mean, she could just go sleep with someone now and not tell me, but as far as I'm aware (and as far as she's told me), she hasn't, so it sounds like she's just kind of warning me ahead of time that this may be a possibility if I continue to develop things with her.\nTL;DR:"}

Also, I absolutely adore him and everything about him and would rather be friends with him forever than to try something and watch it blow up in a few weeks (as I am kind of crazy) and then never get to talk to him again. \n\nI get jealous(which is rare for me...), not of other girls, just anyone, in general  - even pictures of him and his cousin, because they get to go do fun things and I get to watch on facebook.  We both travel a lot for work and when I can't see him regularly, I just miss him so much.  I think about dating him all of the time, but I just know that, at least at this phase in both of our lives, we aren't ready for it and it would just fall apart.  \n\nMy question is how do I get over it?  I mean, normally if I legitimately felt this way and felt like we were a good match, I am really honest about everything and would say something to him...but since I don't want to want it, I don't think he should know because I don't know how he feels about me and telling him could make things worse if he feels the same way...right?  But so, how do I actually get over this?  I've tried giving it time...but I need some kind of technique or something...because the longer I go the harder it gets.\nTL;DR:"}

We became best friends and it came to the point where about 9 months ago she actually sat me down and told me she had feelings for me. We ended up dating for about 7 months before we both realize that things weren't working out between us. It was a mutual break up and we're still in each other's direct social circles, bible study groups, and we both go to the same church. \n\nThe first weekend after the break up she thought I was being an asshole because I was trying to give her space and so she felt invisible. \n\nI've gotten really busy the past year. Actually, a lot of the reason why we broke up was because I was busy with work, school, and balancing her in the equation. I admit I never made her a high priority and if I did it again, I would try harder to put her there at that priority. But with that being said, my overworking has also made it so that I couldn't hang out with my friends. And I've felt depressed about that. Recently I've scaled back at work and I'm re-investing in my friends again. \n\nThis time around though, whenever my ex is around there she doesn't really acknowledge me. And I feel invisible around her. I've brought it up to her and we're going to get coffee in 24 hours to talk things out. We've always been respectful of each other and I still would enjoy her in my life and community, though I know that her presence needs to be scaled back in my life for the sake of healthy friendships. \n\nI don't know if I have any questions. I just want general advice because I haven't been in this spot at all. I know we can't be looking for affirmation from each other and putting each other's feelings first anymore and that's fine. I'm probably just venting and reaching to see if anyone has any advice for me. \n\nI'll end the rant here. Advice anyone?\nTL;DR:"}

We are not huge on texting but when we do text it is always fun and enjoyable, but this past weekend she was very distant. So I sent her a text saying \"so you've been pretty distant as of late, everything ok?\" And she responded basically saying that \"her ex wanted to talk to her and he apologized for everything and the conversation with him went well so she was just providing herself some space to get her head straight\" (paraphrasing). Which makes total sense. I get that. And I honestly expected this to happen, they dated for almost 2 years or so, it's never a \"clean\" break.\n\nBackground: Her ex treats her like shit publicly and privately and none of her friends or family like him. He never made her feel attractive or wanted at all. She broke up with him a while ago and he apologized and promised changed yada yada yada we've all seen it before. Nothing changed and here she is again, broke up with him and now he talked with her again apologizing and yada yada yada.\n\nI truly like this girl and I know that she likes me as well. We attend the same college and are both music composition students. I've always had a huge thing for her and she has admitted that she has always had a thing for me as well.\n\nThe question I have is: Is it best to give her space (obviously) and really have no contact at all (unless, of course she initiates), or give her the space she needs but every once in awhile shoot her a text and see what she is up to and stuff?

Friends/family members of the said family must hold a celebration so that said kid can be revered and enjoyed by all the people who have come by to visit. Initially, I didn't care, as I thought \"right, I'm going to be in the UK, they can do what they want.\" Then I was told it was anywhere between 100-110.. That's where the trouble begins. I arrive back at about that mark..\n\nNow, This is the part I struggle with.\n\n1. I was raised TCK, so I never really bothered to learn up about Chinese culture, and now that I'm older, I just don't really care/I know fuck all anyway.\n\n2. I REALLY DON'T LIKE KIDS. AT ALL. I don't like when they cry, I don't like it when they come near me, I almost threw up when I saw a kid play with his phlegm.. I'm also afraid of children and babies in general and I really don't want to go.. but then the family will give me what I think is unwarranted amount of bullshit for not going.. I'm a Childfree/tokophobic person, and while no one is pregnant, I just don't want to experience that atmosphere. This is an issue with me and not the family, but I need to tell them a reason as to why I can't go. I told them \"I don't want to.\" but only to have my issues 'brushed off'. I'm not pleased by this change and I really don't want to be there.\n\nHow do I handle this so that I don't look like a complete wanker but not go at the same time?\nTL;DR:"}

I saw them argue a lot in middle school/high school and my mom has threatened to leave him many times due to his alcohol problem and his coldness. I'm extremely close to mom. I love my dad but I'm not super close to him.\n\n**NOW**\n\nI'm currently moving and my dad came up to help me pack and move. He got here today, leaves on Sunday. I'm talking to my mom asking her how her day went and we get to the point where we end up talking about how she wants to have someone to \"talk to\". I bring up emotionally cheating and she says my dad has \"someone he talks to.\"\n\nApparently this woman is a bartender he meets up with at midnight. He also goes home really early from work all the time. Also his phone is glued to his hip which he never does. After so many years of trying my mom is finally giving up and moving out.\n\nEven if nothing physical has happened I'm still really uncomfortable being around my dad. I don't know what to do in this situation. Do I talk to him? Ignore the situation? I need help moving up and all my friends are busy this weekend.

We don't live overly close to each other and even then the visits we have are just..awkward. I haven't seen her in months.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, my girlfriend asked for flowers. I promised her I'd get them for her, But to be honest I have no source of income (I'm 16) except what is in my bank (Which I can't withdraw until I'm eighteen) except for the \u00a315 a week I get for being in care, which has had to go on clothes and essentials.\n\nToday, I saw something she'd REALLY like. An Iron Man USB drive. She REALLY likes Marvel, DC, all that shizzle, so I thought 'Hey, I'll get it for her!' I scraped up some money and bought it off amazon, shipped to her house. I then swore to myself I'd try and get her flowers ASAP.\n\nI then messaged her telling her I'd gotten her a gift. What I said was \n\n\"Right I got you something small, there's more to come trust me, I also hadvent' forgotten about the flowers ;) (But thats not it...yet)...I love you x\"\n\nNow I think about it, she probably now thinks I have gotten her flowers instead of the Iron Man USB drive.\n\nMaybe I'm just overreacting a bit (probably) But I don't really want to disappoint her.\n\nShit.\nTL;DR:"}

I had never really talked to him aside from a \"Hey, how are ya?\" now and again. My company wanted me to find a young intern, and they were adamant that it was a male. Since he was the only male on my Facebook friends list that was on.. and based on his school work and the way he carried himself.. I got him an interview and he got the job on the spot.\n\nTurns out I can't even hold the simplest conversation with the guy. All he does is boast about his life, and finds the need to tell everyone his opinion. He refers to a meme every time he talks to someone, and he's overly loud and obnoxious with his voice/conversations.. totally ignoring that everyone is trying to work.\n\nHe'll spend half the day with cracked.com wide open on his screen, and will get upset whenever someone hands work over to him so he can process it. (Which is his job obv.)\n\nThis is a conversation that happened not 20 minutes ago.\n\nAnnoyer: Hey sifilus! What did you get for lunch?\nMe: Oh I just grabbed a turkey san-\nAnnoyer: Cool story bro, so I saw my friend at the store and she was.. blah blah blah.\nMe: Ah.. okay cool.\n\nMan I could just go on and on with the ridiculous hijinks this guy makes us go through. \n\nSo again Reddit.. help me help him realize that he's annoying everyone, including the boss, and could be in danger of losing his job.\nTL;DR:"}

In one of them there has been this extremely cute girl that walks by me at the exact same time every day that I'm cutting a certain area. We usually make eye contact and smile or something along those lines. Eventually I ended up getting off my mower one day and I asked her out. SUCCESS! I get her number and all that and we go on a great date that same night. This happened yesterday. Now today, I'm working in the same area and I'm on a decently steep hill. As usual, she walks by and we make eye contact and smile, but this time I decided (stupidly) to take my hand off the throttle on the machine and wave to her. Right when I do this my mower hit a bump on the grass and the machine goes flying right into some rich old dude's fence...\nSo... Because I'm an idiot, I now owe my company $3000 for a new deck on the mower, and the resident god-knows how much for his immaculate perfect fence that was probably worth a shitload of money as well.\n\nThat was an expensive fucking wave.\nTL;DR:"}

Friends for 7 years.\nPOST: I have this friend, let's call her \"Taylor.\" Taylor and I have known each other for about 7 years or so. We used to work together so we saw each other a lot and a big part of our friendship was venting about work and frustrating coworkers etc.\n\nI got a new job and we haven't been hanging out as much. I realized recently that every time I see her, I leave feeling worse. It's really hard to put my finger on it but I think what it comes down to is just that she feels very competitive and judgemental. I feel like she wants to hear about bad things in my life so she can feel good about her life, and she's not interested in hearing about things that are going well. She also is just like a deeply angry person, and I realize now that pretty much the only thing she's able to talk about is all the people she's mad at and how awful they are. I also have started to get the impression from mutual friends that she probably talks like that about me when I'm not there.\n\nSo it wasn't any one big thing but I'm realizing that I feel worse when I talk to her and I don't think I want to be friends with her anymore. But her wedding is coming up, along with all the associated events (bridal shower, bachelorette party). \n\nI'm wondering if I should just call off the whole friendship now, save myself the hassle of attending these events and save her the cost of me being at the wedding. Or is that just way too harsh, and I should wait until after the wedding and do a slow fade out?\nTL;DR:"}

Just a quick question, I was wondering how I can minimize making my boyfriend jealous/concerned about new friendships ((with guys mostly)). We've been in a long distance relationship now for about three or four months, and have been together for about 10 months, and it's been going well so far.

My boyfriend has joked about being jealous, and once got kind of mad/jealous that I was hanging out with B, my other friend that's a girl, and another friend of B that's a guy. I know a lot of it is on his (my boyfriend's) side, to trust me and to get those thoughts out, but what can I do to make sure and let him know that it's platonic for both me and B? I don't want him to feel negatively towards my new friends, and I don't want him to feel bad about himself that he can't hang out with me like they can.\n\nIs it better to talk about B in a cavalier way a lot to get him used to the name? Or is it better to not talk about him at all, or only mention him in group settings, like \"I went to dinner with H, B and A\" \n\nThanks!!\nTL;DR:"}

However, since we split and got back together, I'm really depressed.\n\nI've tried talking about my feelings with him, but he dismisses whatever I say because I 'owe' him for what I did, so whatever problems I'm experiencing in our relationship, his problems are worse.

It was quite frustrating having a lot of energy left, but not being able to do anything about the lead bricks attached to my hips.\n\nThis was in Austin, TX, and it was very humid and warmer than I normally like (by the finish it was low 70s).  I got plenty of carbs yesterday, and ate oatmeal with fruit for breakfast (I always do before long runs).  I drank some water or gatorade at each aid station, and had a gu every 5 miles.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar, or know what could have been the problem?\nTL;DR:"}

I am not fat though, not drastically fat. People tend to tell me I look cute a lot now, hell, people have even started to flirt with me, albeit online. This girl at the moment, who I have yet to meet (yes she is real, will meet her on Friday) finds me very cute.\n\nThe problem is, I have no confidence in my looks, at all. People have always told me I am ugly, so i feel as though people are telling me this stuff just to make me feel good.\n\nI have always thought I was one of the ugliest people around. Even now, I can't look in a mirror for too long. I can't stand the sight of me.\n\nSo, how do I overcome this? How can I trust people when they say I look good?\nTL;DR:"}

He broke up with me in October. We were having problems and arguing a lot since he went away. He started going out a few nights a week then eventually said he was done and didn't ever want to be with me.\n\nAfter 3 months he started begging to get back with me and saying it was the biggest mistake of his life. He said he would show he changed and that he wasn't going out anymore. \n\nAfter two weeks of talking and trying to work things out he just asked me if it would be okay if he started to go out again. I got really upset, it brought up all the old feelings and made me scared the entire thing was going to happen again. I asked him to call me, I was really stressed on the phone and said I didn't feel comfortable with him going out because I didn't trust him. He hung up on me. \n\nI know its terrible to try to tell someone not to go out and control them, I never did this before, but now I just don't trust him at all. Is this normal to feel that way and not want him to go out? Or should I just let it go? Part of me feels like he hasn't changed, the fact that he already is wanting to go out clubbing and he hung up on me. Should I forget him and keep moving on?\n\nNote: He is moving back to my city in May\nTL;DR:"}

Not just as a simple 'hobby', but an actual career and vocation. However, frankly, I'm scared to take the plunge. I'm 22, and halfway done with a university science degree. Recently, I've come to terms with the fact that this is NOT what I want in life. 'You should go to college' has always just been an idea pushed on me by others my whole life. I'm not struggling with classes or anything of that sort (always get A's and B's), but I have this constant persistent nagging ambition to make music.

It's been this way for years and years now, but I've always just pushed that ambition away. \n\nNow I've realized that if I really want to do this music thing professionally, I need to take the plunge now. I can't make my music as good as it needs to be while I'm going to school (time, energy, motivation constraints), therefore I'm considering dropping out of university. I want to get started on this professional music path while I'm still young and able to take chances and make mistakes (and before the student loans rack-up even more).\n\nI'm worried about how to get a career started with this music thing; getting recognized, promoted, having enough money to pay bills, etc. It's such an ominous path, and there's really no telling where it will lead to. I expect it to be quite difficult. However, I'm willing and ready to work my ass off to pursue this thing.\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation? Dropping out of your 'expected' and 'safe' life path to pursue an ambition? How did it turn out for you? Was is worth it in the end?

Its very well known that my college drops about half of the accepted students and because of this basically everyone is horrible. It's been three months into school and I've tried to make small talk and make some friends. My logic is that if we don't understand anything, we can help each other and have that support group. I'm not saying I'm the most outgoing smartest person here, it's very obvious that they're intelligent since they got accepted but everyone here is just rude and mean. For an example, my Chem recitation class where it's group work dependent, I don't understand a concept and I asked my team mates for help. They literally straight up said no. Even though it's a team grade instead of individual. I feel like an outcast here. Some people literally said straight up in my face \"the less people here the better\". My only \"friend\" aka the person that I have all my classes with blowed up at me because I didn't reply to her text under five seconds. The people I become friendly with only use me for hw,textbooks etc. but when I ask help in return they suddenly ignore me. Yes it's a bit of a rant but i feel like I don't belong and hate my college experience. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/college\nTITLE: Spanish or Sign Language? (Or something else?)\nPOST: For my major, my university requires 4th semester proficiency in a language. I am really interested in sign language, but I have high school background in Spanish. They have a Spanish placement test here and it is possible to place out of all 4 Spanish courses, but I haven't taken Spanish in 2.5 years, so I'm fairly rusty. I'm confident I can place out of two semesters worth, so that saves some credits/money.\n\nDespite all this, I am really interested in sign language, but I would have to take all 4 semesters of it (using up 12 credits I could put towards something else/graduating earlier) and the course sections are very hard to get into. Like, they only offer 35 spaces and one course section for each level every semester. \n\nI know Spanish is likely more useful than sign language, but I don't like Spanish at all. Any thoughts? Is there another totally awesome language I should consider instead of either?\nTL;DR:"}

At first I tried to resist the temptation because I knew it wasn't the right thing to do, but as time went by I started to want to do the naughty things with her.\nShe wasn't having any of that though. She was perfectly comfortable cheating on her girlfriend by doing inappropriate things to me, yet if I were to try any inappropriate things on her she would say \"That's not OK. You know I have a girlfriend, right?\" and she would say hurtful things to me.\n\nThis went on for about 4ish years until one day she asked me to \"Give her a hand\". After which she started to show remorse for her actions started taking her relationship with her girlfriend seriously. She still did things that would constitute as cheating, but they were far less frequent, that is until last month.\n\nSometime last month she felt sorry for me and finally threw me a bone. Her and I had the sex and it was awful. She wouldn't stop making jokes and telling me how sure she is of her sexuality now. Afterwards she apologized for all the stuff she has put me through over the years and she told me that she has never felt any form of attraction for me. She says that she wants to be just friends now and she says that she will be a better friend.\n\nWhat I want to know is\n\n* Should two people go back to being friends after years of actions that border on sexual and verbal abuse? I mean, I really care about her even though she was kind of a jerk for a really long time.\n\n* Can I be just friends with someone I've seen naked? \n\n* Can anyone tell me why she clings to the lesbian label despite the fact that she obviously enjoyed doing inappropriate things to my person?\n\n* Should I have told her girlfriend? I mean, they live together now.\n\nAlso I'm willing to elaborate further on anything that I wasn't very clear on.\nTL;DR:"}

I plan on getting a job, and have a trial tomorrow, the trouble is I desperately want to go home for my holidays, easter and summer. But, and what i didn't realise until now, from my employers perspective they are hiring me, only to lose me during their busiest season. \n\nLet me try and explain this situation the best I can. \n\nIm 19 and studying around 260 miles and a ferry ride from my rural home, so quick trips home are out of the equation. At home I have a part time job Waiting and as Kitchen Porter, I am close to my friends and family and I'm staying with my parents **(rent free!!)** \nAt Uni, I am paying rent, bills, groceries and studying. My course is only 3 days a week, so i have time to waste (work). \n\nSo i guess my questions to you are: should i take on a job during term time, and hope they understand i want to go home during summer (when they need employees the most), and risk them not letting me leave? Will I  have to quit/lose my job? Or do I find somewhere to live whilst i work here through summer, so I can hold down a job I might not necessarily have after summer during term time, and end up earning less than I would at home?\n\nI know that staying here and holding a job down through summer might be best in the long term, but i feel if i stay here through summer I'll be missing out on everything and everyone back home and will be insanely homesick.\n\nThanks for your time, M.\nTL;DR:"}

I'll start.\nPOST: Today, while driving home with a few of my friends, my buddy rear ended someone (not very fast. Only about 5 mph). No one in the crash was hurt and we all pulled over to exchage info and wait for the police officer to show up. Once the officer showed he did his usual buisness of checking what happened and doing his reports and what not. Well, while we were in our car waiting for the police officer to return. Another collision occures with two different vehicles going at much faster speeds. This is the first thing I regret. Once the collision happened I just sat in the car shocked not knowing what to do. I could have gone and helped or at least checked on the occupants of the vehicle but I just fucking sat there. Skip ahead a bit and more cops are there, ambulance, fire fighters you know the deal. Well the person that got hit was being hauled away on a stretcher and didn't look like he was in good shape. While he was being carried away, the guy that hit him was standing near me. This is the second thing I regret. This guy looked devastated and that is understandable but no one was there for him. Once they found out he was \"alright\" they just left him until the paperwork needed to be done. The guy was all dirty and looked exhausted coming home from a hard days work it looked like and I felt so bad for him. I could have went up to this guy just to check on him, to see how he was holding up, if he needed anything like water or food (we were ther for a while), but all did was just stand there and feel sorry for him.\n\nSo I ask you this reddit. If you could go back and help that person what would you do?\nTL;DR:"}

It was the culmination of a strange, depressed, quarter life crisis part of my life. She was my best friend and we were/are so in sync on everything. But I had a phase and I didn't realize what i wanted and I ended up breaking up with her and completely crushed her heart. She doesn't open up to people ever and she opened up to me and I ended up breaking her heart into a million pieces. I felt and still feel awful and want nothing more than to make it right.\n\nI approached her after not talking to her for 3 months and it wasn't awkward at all but she explained to me that she does not trust me at all and she doesn't know if she ever will again. I have to believe there are some feelings there otherwise she wouldn't have agreed to meet me, but I need to regain her trust and I don't know how to do that exactly. I don't want to force my way into her life, but I want her to let me back in organically. Other than breaking up with her I always treated her the right way. I never lied, I wasn't abusive, mean, or any of that. I just went through a weird period where I didn't think I was in love with her the way I should have been and because of that I felt like I needed to break up with her.

The next day I went in again (I train daily) and she was flirting with me again, so I asked her out. \n\nSince then we've been going out a couple of times a week. She's pretty relaxed and laid back, and we definitely have a lot in common, but I find myself getting frustrated with her communication style.\n\nWhen we first started chatting she'd text me a lot, was prompt in responses, etc. We both work full time - and both love our jobs - so I understand I'm not a priority, nor do I expect to be one. Last night I tried making plans and didn't get a response for 12 hours, and then her response was that she had work until late and \"might go out after that\" depending on how she felt. She didn't get back to me at all.\n\nStuff like this really pisses me off, because since we started dating I've felt like I have been making the most effort to instigate conversation or make plans. I normally would have just cut my losses and called it a day, but she has explicitly stated a few times that she is into me and enjoys my company/wants this to go further. In the same place though, I feel like we haven't known each other long enough for me to tell her I'd like her to make more effort.\n\nAnother element to this that bugs me is that when we're out she can instantly respond to work inquiries (which I somewhat understand), but go 24+ hours without even a, \"Hey, how was your day?\" or something casual. I'm a pretty laid back guy, but it's starting to wear me down.\nTL;DR:"}

I had a very happy childhood and honestly, never felt like anything was missing. My father's family would tell me stories about my mother and her family, and everything they told me portrayed her in a good light. So it's not like I grew to dislike her or anything. She would occasionally call me and when I was seven, she visited and spent the day with me (she moved to a different country after the break up). As I've said, these circumstances never upset me or made me look at her askance. When she'd call, it would be like hearing from a fun aunt in a distant, exciting place. \n\nI visited her once when I was 16, and we've spoken on the phone a handful of times. The last time we spoke was last year when she called me to wish me a Happy New Year. I said I'd call\nher again soon and then...I never got around to doing it. The thing is, there is no sense of urgency to do so, and that seems to be the dynamic between us. \n\nI wonder how healthy this is, and if I eventually come to regret this.

We thought that it must be an uncontrolled baby or toddler crying or screaming because of the turbulence. Understandable right? Well we were ok with it at first but fast forward 2 hour, not so much. \n\nIt must have been 2 or so in the morning without even a single 40 winks. Clearly us and many people on the plane were annoyed with the periodic screaming. However none of wanted to leave and tell the people off since they likely had the worst of it by having a screaming child right next to them. After hours of listening to the screaming it starts to sound like some baby dinosaur crying for its mother. This is when I open my big mouth and say \"I'm sick of these motherfucking baby dinosaurs on this motherfucking plane!!\" full Samuel L Jackson like. Luckily only my sis and some of my the people around and they start cracking up. We keep making these sort of jokes throughout the ride and I guess the air hostesses understand our pain and start the movies.\n\nFast forward to the end of the flight and I meet with my familam at the baggage claim area. Then we hear the screaming again, we found out who exactly was making the noise. It turns out it was a severely handicapped autistic child in a wheelchair with a bike helmet and all.

When I found out, I told the girlfriend of one of others who I've become friends with. She also has a zero tolerance and basically told her partner the same thing - one more time and he's out.\n\nThis morning I found out that her boyfriend is still very much doing it, making trips to the other guys house in which to do so. He lives with her in her parents out and he is still very much in the 'fear of missing out' stage of life. He's always asking my bf to go out during the week for drinks but as my bf has a professional job, he resists. On the occasion where they do go out, this guy is always conveniently broke, meaning my bf foots the bill. Im getting more and more agitated about this as I'm looking to buy a house, get married and all the rest of that stuff - but if he continues to help his friend out, it's not going to happen. Plus there's always the nagging feeling that they will do coke together again.\n\nWhat I want to ask is if I should tell my friend about her BF?

Now she's broken up with me and I'm in pain. \n\nDue to this being a long distance relationship and her not wanting to lack a physical relationship for another extended period of time she wants to breakup. I understand, but it's very hard for me to deal with. \n\nWe are different people, different age group, temperaments, and background. I was always interested in her life, and her in mine. Then after our last visit she started taking medication for depression and anxiety. \n\nThe medication I believe changed her slightly. She started working full time as well for the first time. She became confident and busy. She wasn't depressed anymore, so she didn't need me to help her. Now she wants to start exploring and getting to know other men intimately. \n\nIt hurts, but I don't want to lose her as a friend. How do I cope with this?\nTL;DR:"}

My landlord informed me today (after I complained to them that one of the kids decided it'd be cute to run down the stairs and knock on my door loudly and then flee) that they are also extremely dirty and have roaches everywhere.

Being in different timezones is fully possible to customer isn't thinking about my dad being at home and sitting down to dinner with his family at this time since the customer would be just getting out of work around then (5:30 cst), but being in a business that is nationwide is something he should consider when calling at this time nearly every day.  Lately him interrupting our family dinner nearly every night has really started to get on my dad's nerves so he decided to do something about it. Since it would sound rude and isn't good business to tell the customer to stop calling at that time he started letting all his after hours calls go to voicemail. After screening the voicemail to make sure it wasn't too important he started saving the callbacks till the next morning.  So when he gets into work (usually about 7:45am est) he calls his customer back.  He says hearing his customer whispering into the phone, trying not to wake his wife up, and having a scratchy morning voice makes all the trouble worth it.

In fact, I couldn't imagine a life without her at the moment.\n\nBut there's this one thing. We start to fight about my job fairly often in the last couple of weeks. I'm an entrepreneur and I still study at university at the same time. This basically means that I work 8am-6pm, sometimes with university in between during the day. I sometimes work longer hours (ie up to 9pm) but I try to limit those days and have them when we didn't want to meet up after work. I live in the city I work at whereas she comes from outside but also studies in this city. So sometimes she's done with university at 4pm whereas I'm still working in my office (just a little outside the city). She doesn't understand that I simply can't take my time off work when there's still things to be done and I need to work from my computer. She constantly mentions how much time I spend at work even tough I still have all the weekend to hang out with her. The point is, she's a student but she also works on the side (just not that much). I've never complained about that, I think it's a great thing.\n\nI'm worried about what will happen if I have bigger obligations in the future. I don't know if she can be there to support me and I also don't know if I'm being selfish by not being more flexible about my work.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: I don't know what to do...\nPOST: So a lot of weird stuff has happened to me the last few days. Okay, first of all, my brother was dating someone and they were getting along really well. But then she broke up with him, and told him she was a lesbian all a sudden. We were talking about it, and he said he didn't take it too hard, but one thing was really bothering him; he told me that she was trying to get him to \"become\" gay. I guess that was the other half of the break-up. Anyway, fast-forward a few weeks. Me, my bro, my cousin, and his friend were driving home from Providence. On the way home, we passed by my bro's ex's house, and we got to talking. Well, actually *they* got to talking. I was chilling listening to this conversation; \"She has something wrong with her.\", \"She is a walking sin, it is against the bible to be gay\", \"She think it's cool to be gay\", \"She is a fucking faggot.\", \"If you're gay, there is a screw loose in you.\", I bet you can guess where this is going. One thing they mentioned is that she is only 15, and it's just a phase. Now here is my problem; I'm only 14. I've lied about my age on Reddit already, but I have to tell the truth here. **I'm having gay feelings, and I want to come out.** Except, my family are strict Catholics, my cousins clearly won't be supportive, my friends are extremely un-supportive of gays also, basically shunning the few people that have come out at my school, and to top it all off, I find more than a few my friends attractive. I don't know if this really *is* a phase, if I'm actually gay, and if I should come out. I can't get any help from anybody I know. Maybe Reddit can help.\nTL;DR:"}

Well we decided to throw on Saturday for a friends birthday. We let him know ahead of time. Anyways, to make a long story short, we had the party then he called the cops on us for a noise complaint. At no time did he tell us we needed to turn the music down. There were no fights or anything belligerent happening at the party. Anyways, now we obviously want him out if he calls the cops on us.

What to do?\nPOST: Hey Reddit,\n\nI'm a 22 year old girl. Got married on papers in February this year. The guy lives in Canada. We haven't lived together for once as he had to go back for his job. My husband and I talk to each other via skype etc. He asked me if I had any previous relationships and I told him honestly that never in my life I had any interest towards the relationships before marriage (not allowed in our religion). I asked him too and he said he had 2 girl friends when he was in high school. I asked him if he had any in Canada as I don't have any concern with his past but just wanted to know but he replied no he had two when he was in his home town and that too not very vey serious one. \n\nHe is very sincere to me now and I trust him 100 % but few days back we exchanged our facebook passwords. He said he was stalking me and I felt good that he is concerned but when out of curiosity i opened his facebook inbox and read his old messages I got to know that he was in sexual relationship with a girl in 2009 there in Canada and that whole relationship lasted for less than 2 months. I wonder why dint he delete that conversation in which he and that girl have written details of their sexual activities after doing that. I am shattered.\n\n Our religion doesn't allow such things and we have to be virgin before marriage. I can't share it with ANYONE as it will give his bad impression. I always had framed him a decent guy with moral values. We ourselves haven't talked about sex and such stuff till now as I don't want to loose the attraction of proper wedding which we will have after my studies and paperwork. I can't respect him from my heart and can't talk to him properly. He is asking me what's the matter but I don't want to embarrass him either. \n\nWhat should I do? I never wanted my husband to be used by someone else before me and I always prayed to have a pure man. I am literally suffocating. Should I mention that whole thing to him? Tell my parents? or move on?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My girlfriend [20 F] thinks I [23 M] emotionally cheated, how can I get her to move on?\nPOST: Ok so here's the background:\n\nMy current gf (I will call her Jill) and I have been dating for nearly 2 years and things are going extremely well. We are young but our relationship developed quickly and we are very serious about being together for the long haul. Now, like a year prior to meeting her I began (very randomly) messaging with a middle aged woman (that I will call Sally) that I ran across via a Facebook comment board. I wasn't planning on ever doing anything with this relationship, I pretty much just wanted to experiment to see what random internet sex messaging was like with a stranger. Pretty simple, college guy is lonely. Anyways, over time that conversation with Sally got to be almost like a pen pal thingy where we she would message me (she always messaged me first, never vice verse) periodically every few months to see how I am and so on, and I would respond and ask how she is but I would also still throw in some explicit comments here and there because that ended up just being how I conversed with this woman. \n\nOk now fast forward to three weeks ago and Jill ran across one of these messages I received from Sally when she was snooping around on my Facebook account one day and got really pissed. I can see how Jill was be pissed as this looks very strange having not been a part of the conversation with Sally all this time. Jill considers this emotional cheating after seeing my comments but it was never any way emotional for me. It was purely experimental. I never once even masturbated to the thought of Sally. Let alone want to have a secret emotional relationship with her. I have anything and everything I could ever want/need in Jill and I want to fix this so we can move on. This is my last hurdle to get over before settling in for a long and happy life with Jill. How can I convince her that I was not in any way emotionally cheating in her with Sally? Jill wants an explanation as to why I did what I did with Sally and I explained it was all experimental but she won't buy it. What are your thoughts? All of your help is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

Apparently, the bank had instructed the collecting agency that my loan was now in default just HOURS before I made my payment and not to accept my payment...a fact that neither party decided to inform me of until well after.\n\nDuring my months-long back-and-forth with the bank I find out that my repayment schedule should not even have begun when it did (15 days after my graduation!) due to my school reporting an earlier graduation date to the bank. Even after presenting proof from my department head and the school's registrar of the mistake the bank continues to threaten me with having my loan defaulted.\n\nI have been working with a pleasant case manager for a little while now who keeps trying to help but I fear this is a losing battle. I'm afraid of the hit my credit will take if this huge private loan (~100K) goes into default. Every other aspect of my financials is being taken care of responsibly (2 other loan repayments that I am making on schedule, credit card almost paid off with early monthly payments, etc.)\n\nThe other problem is that I am engaged and don't want my fiancee's good credit to be brought down by my financial problems.\n\nSo 3 questions:\n\n1.

I honestly don't know what I should have made it.\n\nAround seven months ago I injured my left knee while running Track and Field (I do 400's/800's) for my College. The best way to describe it is whenever I run I feel a lot of pain behind my left knee and when If I put my hand on it I can almost feel like a tendon is \"pushed out\". While I was originally optimistic about my recovery... well... it hasn't been going so well. \n\nI've been through two physical therapists and the doctor I've seen already was useless (walked in, took an x-ray, said he didn't know what was wrong and left in less than 10 minutes). All of them had different ideas on what was wrong- whether it was a baker's cyst, tendonitis or an issue with my Gastrocnemius behind the knee (which I believe is the correct one.) I've been doing all the recommended stretching and running exercises given to me since late July/August and while they've helped somewhat I still feel like I haven't made much progress and I'm currently dealing with scar tissue that somehow appeared in my left calf. \n\nI can start jogging again which is great... but I need to roll out heavily and do stretching afterwards. For sprinting though it's just a straight up no and I will still feel pain during the night or when laying down in bed even If I only did stretching for the day.\n\nMy friends and family have been concerned as well as to how long this is taking, which, needless to say is starting to scare me as well. my season also starts in a few weeks and I just don't know what to do. I'm going to be seeing another doctor in a week and was going to go over the idea of a Cortisone injection (never had one before.)

Great girl, amazing personality, really understood / accepted the person I am etc. You know how that works. Well, long story short, she's been in an ongoing battle with depression and it ended up getting pretty serious so we're now taking a relationship break so she can sort out her issues. She said she felt like our relationship would turn into therapy for her. I respect her decision.\n\nSo, we're on a break currently with the stipulation that neither of us see or have relations with anyone else during the break, and that we'd talk every few days so I could see how she was handling things. The problem is, that hasn't happened at all. She has made absolutely no effort to stay in any form of contact with me save a text here and there. I'm getting pretty tired of not getting a return call back or even a text explaining she was busy. (which is once or so a week, not every day. I'm not the type to pester.)\n\nI'm currently considering moving 10 hours away to pursue jobs and eventually graduate school in a city that holds much more promise than where I'm currently at. It feels like the most difficult decision I've ever had to make because on one hand, I need to look out for myself and my future, on the other hand, I'm absolutely crazy about this girl. But hey, if she's not trying to meet me in the middle here at all, there's probably not a relationship to save. It just really sucks. I've always been of the opinion that if you want to be with someone badly enough, you'll do whatever you need to do to make that happen. I just don't think she feels that way about me anymore, and her actions don't reflect that either. But, maybe it's a depression thing?\n\nSo, feel free to give me your thoughts here.

I originally dated this girl in 9th grade for a long time and ended, then we just started hooking up our senior year of high school, which lasted 2 months. We then ended somewhat recently and we've been kind of on/off since. The second time we got back together this year, we hung out all night although didn't tell me until hours later that she had sex with her ex like a week after we ended. We weren't exclusive when it happened but still... it hurt; after hearing that we stopped. Recently she actually has been hooking up with my teammate from school which has also been rough yet she has told me she loves me and doesn't want to hurt me. We hooked up once again last week and ended shortly after, but this time it seemed more permanent (lol probably doesn't seem that way to you guys/girls). Anyways... do you think I'm being immature by not getting over the sex with the ex-boyfriend so quickly after we first ended, or how she's treated me by hooking up with people i'm close to or at times when she probably realized it would hurt. She says she only cares about me but I really don't trust her that much anymore. To be honest, I've been really torn up about everything and she has really hurt me, especially since I had very strong feelings for her, that I still somewhat have. I've never been this hurt by a girl before and it's been difficult. Do you think I should forgive her and be with her or just try to move on. We both are going to college though in August far from each other and wouldn't stay together for that either, it's just a matter of the next few months. Pretty much all of my friends think i should end it and move on as i deserve better but who knows. What do you all think? Thanks\nTL;DR:"}

It all started Junior year (before that I never really had a girlfriend) when I was put in the same 5 classes as this nice, pretty girl that I'd never really talked to before then. Seeing as I spent all day with her 5 days a week, we got to talking, a lot. It was pretty obvious that we both liked each other, but we both lacked confidence to do anything about it. So this talking went on for around 4 months, and we became really close friends. Honestly, I was afraid I'd been friendzoned.\n\nWell one weekend i decided to drop a pair and tell her I liked her. I did over text (remember lack of confidence), and she said the same thing yada yada. It took me a good week after that to ask her out, and the first date actually went pretty good. Stupid thing I did was assume she was my girlfriend without asking her to be my girlfriend, that was really embarrassing. So for the next month, we saw each other 6 or 7 days of the week, and anytime not spent together we were texting. Now she's the kind of girl that likes to take things slow; even went to our Junior Prom together. And I mean *real* slow. 3 months before kissing, and a month before holding hands. Looking back, that's extremely weird, but I didn't care at the time. \n\nNow the signs came pretty early, but I was kinda oblivious. She wanted to stop going on dates, we fought over stupid little things, didn't talk as much. Out of the blue, she dumps me. Heartbroken, I beg to get her back. But she moves on to this guy who had said some shit about me just cause I was dating her. So I spend the next 6 months trying to be friends with her. Sad and mopey every time I see her, cry when she gets asked to Homecoming. Really pathetic. Ended up we just hate each others guts now and probably won't ever see each other again now that we've graduated. But to hell with it I've never been better.\nTL;DR:"}

We have met in person, but due to lack of money, only been able to be in person 3 times total.  \n\nIt has been for the most part a happy relationship, no real big fights (except for one glaringly large one I'll get to in a moment), he's a kind and sweet man, we're mostly alike personality-wise, shared views, etc.  \nExcept, in those 5 years he has not gotten a job.\nIf I bring it up, he takes a stab at searching for a few days and then goes back to whatever he wants to be doing, usually video games.  \n\nWe literally cannot move forward until he gets a job, and I am so incredibly *tired* of this argument  and feeling alone and disappointed. But. I feel so guilty, like I'm being a crappy person. The stupid little voice inside is saying 'Maybe, maybe it'll be different this time. It could get better and everything will be fine'.  \n\nHe has sworn every which way he's serious this time, this time will be different. He says he doesn't know why he does this. And tells me he doesn't want to lose me as I'm 'the best thing that's ever happened in his life and I give him a reason to try' but I can't trust him to follow through. \n\nOn one hand I want it to work as I do both like and love him nor do I want to hurt him in any way, but I think he pushed my faith in him too far to go through this again. I'm so afraid of being stupid and wasting yet another year waiting for nothing.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Anyone interested in me writing a journal of my thoughts and discoveries while reading the bible for the first time?\nPOST: As the title says, you interested? The thought was to begin with the new testament (That's the one I have in paper form atm)\n\nHere's a taste on what I'm gonna be writing:\n\n\"So, started reading *the* book today.. Well, It didn't take long for me to start laughing like a bloody maniac.. Here's why.\nOn the first page they start by following Jesus heritage back to David, among others, and then this bit comes: *Matthan was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary\u2014of whom Jesus was born, who is called the Christ.*\n*So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon to the Christ.*\n\nAren't we forgetting something? Look at this:\n*This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place. When Mary his mother was engaged to Joseph, before they were married, she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Joseph her husband was a righteous man. Because he didn't want to humiliate her, he decided to call off their engagement quietly. As he was thinking about this, an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child she carries was conceived by the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you will call him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" *\n\nSo, Jesus is the son of Joseph, who is the son of Jac.. No wait, that's not right. Jesus is the son of **God**, not Joseph. She was a virgin when she birthed Jesus, therefore Jesus does not have any relation to Joseph, and not to David. Oh, unless Joseph and Mary was related.. But then that would be even more wrong, wouldn't?\n\nSo,\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by dragging a dead deer across my yard\nPOST: So I live in \"upstate\" new York, where is cold, windy, and snowy. Wild life is a normal thing around here. So I was out shoveling snow off the front walkway and porch when I noticed something odd, my heart skipped a beat and there at my feet a deer curled up in the corner. The poor little fellow must have snuggled down in the corner during the wind last night and died. I did not want to leave a dead deer next to my front door, so I took some garden string and wrapped it around the legs then dragged the dead deer through the snow to the street. As I did this I hear a yell and for some reason some family decides its a good idea to walk there dog in the -20 wind chill. I look up and the mother is notified as the little kid clings to her leg, and they walk off the other way. To top it off, I know one of my neighbors from school and I could see her watching me from the window as I was struggling to pull the body over the mound of snow by the road. So now I have to wait for the town to come take it, or maybe some random person, because the town offices reopen Tuesday, and its Sunday.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: Damage, repairs, and liability\nPOST: Location: Montgomery Co., Maryland, USA\n\nBackground:\n\nMy girlfriend (now wife) moved into an apartment in June, 2013. It is\nthe basement of a house in a very nice neighborhood. The owners live upstairs. The apartment has a separate entrance, and we do not typically interact with the landlord/lady at all.\n\nWhile getting adjusted to the new place, our dog tore up the carpet at the front door.\n\nInstead of replacing the carpet, the landlord chose to install tile to create a faux foyer at the door. On several occasions he stated that we would not incur any cost from this work due to: it was not a replacement, it was something they had been wanting to do, it was an upgrade.\n\nHis carpenter put in tile and metal flashing at the junction of the tile and carpet. While screwing in the metal flashing, a screw caught on the carpet and ripped a 2 ft seam extending away from the door; this happened on both sides of the door.\n\nThe carpenter came back and patched the carpet that was ripped, but, since it's very low-pile, it doesn't hide the seams of the patch. Landlady was very upset with the work. The carpenter offered to replace the carpet, as it was his mistake. Landlady declined. The landlords decided to then re-carpet the entire room (10ft x 15ft) at the cost of $695.\n\nProblem:\n\nLandlord is billing us for the cost to replace and install the carpet. The repair will happen when we vacate the apartment (lease ends June, 2015). The payment is not to come from the security deposit, but will be a single charge that must be paid within 60 days.\n\nLandlord claims we are still paying for the destruction caused by our dog. I think this is bollocks, since that damage was remedied by installing tile. I expect to pay for something, but I do not intend on getting robbed for shitty carpet.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My[18M] with my friend[18M] and his gf [18F]\nPOST: I am a guy. I used to flirt with this guy and was led on.

But whatever.\n\nI then only treated him as a friend, but whenever I text him occassionally since he is a nice friend, his girlfriend always tags him in some pictures or he updates his profile pic with his gf, etc. I know because he rarely uses FB and only after I text him does he post or his gf posts/tags.\n\nI am wondering why.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me[17M] and my friend [18F] are pretty close. I'm wondering if I'm crossing any lines?\nPOST: Writing this, the idea \"if it sounds rude, it's probably rude\" is running through my mind, so I figure I might as well make sure. So my I hang out with this friend a lot, and we talk or text the whole day just about every day (summer) and talk a lot on non-summer days as well. I'm not attached to her in any really intimate way, and honestly can't see her as anything other than a really great friend (honestly, thinking of her another way would be like thinking as such with a sister), but we do kinda share everything with each other and are really close. I think we've known each other for about three years now (first person to meet her when she moved here). \n\nBut here's the kicker. She has a boyfriend who's a great guy, and she hangs out with him most days of the summer as well. Now she clearly loves this guy, and I don't really care about the dating thing because I'm not into her like that and am glad she's happy. The thing I'm wondering about is if it's rude that I spend so much time texting or talking to her while out of state (and hanging out when in state) when she has a boyfriend? He doesn't care, so I figure I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill, but hey, doesn't hurt to be sure (I don't know much about relationships haha). \n\nWe don't talk about sex (well not with each other) or anything intimate like that and she knows I'm crushing on another girl (oof that's a whole another story; I should make a unique post about \nthat =p), so I'm wondering if anything is off here or if I'm just overreacting. I'm curious is all.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: Tifu by forgetting that I wasn't drinking Dr. Pepper\nPOST: I work in the control room for a corrugated sheet plant. We're a start up and working on getting a third shift going. Right now I'm training the guy who will be the third shift control room operator and relieve me of the long days. Until now I've been coming in at 5am and leaving at 4pm so I'm really looking forward to him being trained up. \nHe's a pretty cool guy and one of my friends at work I'd totally have chosen him for the job if it was my choice. This morning I left to go to the bathroom and get a drink from the vending machine. I almost buy Dr. Pepper but decide to get some mountain dew since he already had Dr. Pepper and I didn't want to drink out of his beverage. \nSkip foreword about an hour and I'm down to the last bit of dew and he's got an empty bottle. Seeing as our job involves a lot of standing around, he goes outside for a walk and a cigarette. When he comes back in he has a dip in his mouth. Naturally he uses his empty bottle as a spitter. This is when the day goes from mediocre to just bad. As we're dealing with some production issue I turn around to take the last swig of my soda. I unscrew the cap and make a joke to him. He's standing kinda close but I smell his dip breath strong. I tip my head back and as the liquid hits my mouth I remember that I didn't get Dr. Pepper. Also, my soda is still cold and not even brown. I had dip spit in my mouth. I try to spit it back into the bottle but then I panic and spit it all over the control panel and onto the floor. I and everyone else who was in the room gagged about it for about 20 minutes. Now I double check my drink before every sip.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: [PA] Opinions on Social Gathering Ordinances\nPOST: Hi [/r/legaladvice](\n\nI recently heard about a couple of city ordinances passed in central PA college towns, and want to get your opinion. Here is the actual text: [Lewisburg Ordinance](\n\nThe ordinance was mentioned previously [here] and [here](\n\nThe key points of the Lewisburg ordinance (as I see them -- feel free to correct me or tell me to add something) are as follows:\n\n* social gatherings with more than X number of people where alcohol will be served or consumed must \n\n  * be registered with the city/town.\n  * allow the police to do walk-throughs.\n  * have a portable toilet per 100 people.\n  * end by 1 AM.\n\nThe primary challenges I see to this are:\n\n* 1st Amendment (freedom to **peacefully** assemble): This is a bit dubious, since a party is hardly peaceful (as mentioned in one of the previous posts). However, the ordinance is so broad that it would require churches (esp. those serving wine for Communion, e.g. Catholic) to obtain permits for services. I also believe that it would require unions (another group with special legal protections) to register their meetings, though I'm not sure if unions are a good example.\n* 4th Amendment: The ordinance allows the police to enter the premises of a party without a warrant or exigent circumstance.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Bloomsburg, PA was considering passing a [similar ordinance] but seems to have dropped it after the ACLU of PA wrote them a [letter] The ACLU mentioned just the potential 1st amendment implications, which are remarkably similar to those of the Lewisburg ordinance.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, Reddit? Specifically, I would like your thoughts on the legality of the Lewisburg (or Bloomsburg) ordinance in general and in relation to the issues mentioned above. Corrections would also be greatly appreciated :).\n\nAlso, what are the appropriate next steps to challenge the ordinance?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: Clueless me (m20), looking for advice on getting a date?\nPOST: So, early disclaimer, I've never been so much as a date before. I don't think that there is anything wrong with me, I'm fit, decently attractive, intelligent- I mean, I like me...  but  still, I am somewhat shy. Not \"muttering unintelligibly\" shy but \"usually doesn't speak unless spoken to first\" shy. And I am completely oblivious to signals from girls, even if they were interested, so that doesn't help also.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to last week where we started class on campus. In one of my classes, we were assigned to a \"discussion group\" thing, and one of the people in my group is really nice, pretty, other cliche, etc. So, we traded numbers in the group as a matter of contacting each other.\n\nWe've talked (well, texted) a couple of times, but mainly about class stuff; though it dows always ends with a lot of that \"c u Thursday smiley face lol\" line of deep conversation.\n\nI was just curious, would it be in the realm of sane thought and action for me to ask her on a date - something casual, coffee, movie, something like that (I really don't know)- over the phone or possible by text? I know the latter isn't ideal, but it seems the best for me: I'm perfectly calm and charismatic up to the moment I try to ask someone out, where it all falls apart. But, hey, I've been rejected plenty of times and stood up once, so... yeeah.\nTL;DR:"}
