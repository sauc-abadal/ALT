Yesterday our parents sat the three oldest of us down and told us they had filed for divorce. I'm not really bothered by it since I saw it coming. My real problem is I don't want to go anywhere my siblings go.\n\nI don't have a good relationship with my family. My mum and dad haven't gotten along for years and have always taken their frustration out on me. They didn't want to parent us and wanted me to step up and take care of my siblings.\n\nMy siblings and I hate each other. My brother thinks its funny to wreck my stuff and steal my savings (summer jobs). My sister steals my stuff and is physically abusive (hits and scratches me). If I retaliate I get slapped and if I try to take my stuff back I get yelled at because \"I'm the older sibling and should be the bigger person\". The 6 year old is alright since he hasn't picked up any bad habits from those two and I wouldn't mind him staying with me.\n\nWhen my parents split I want to be away from them, I want to be in the custody of the person who doesn't have their custody. I wouldn't mind going to foster homes if it comes to that, I reckon it'll be better than having those two constantly ruin my days. I don't really want to meet them either if my non-custodial parent gets visiting rights.\n\nI don't know if I'll get asked for my preference when my custody is decided. I talked to me school counselor and she said she didn't know much about it (haven't had any kid come to her with that problem) but said she'd expect the judge to get that sorted. I don't really want to choose between my mum and dad, I just want my brother and sister to not be with me.\n\nHow do I tell the judge this if he asks me? I really want him to take me seriously on this. Thanks for reading.\nTL;DR:"}

I didn't really know how talk with other guys in my class, much less girls. Fast forward to the middle of the school year my English teacher places us into groups of 5 to peer review/edit our papers. Lucky me got grouped with 4 other girls including my crush. So the discussion began. First, we each read eachothers papers and made corrections, then we discussed eachothers main points aloud. It was then my crush's turn to discuss her main points in her paper. She talked about how the advancement in technology has made more people socially awkward and how the it would be even greater as more advancements take place. As with any discussion people would chip in their ideas or thoughts. It was at that moment I made an unfortunate decision. I tried to play along and add some of my thoughts only to tell the whole group I've experienced social awkwardness first-hand... with myself... I believe it came out as \"Yeah, I totally agree.

She only stayed about two days and then went back to her own apartment. This happened about 3 times before I started noticing little bite marks on my legs when getting into bed. My bedroom was in the basement and had a carpet floor, but the shitty carpet that's all flat and rough because the people who had the house before us used it as a sewing room (old lady). Then I noticed that there were little black things crawling up my legs and biting me and realized that they were fleas. Fuck having hairy legs. The fuckers would crawl up my socks and bite right where the socks meet my shins. Fuck everything about them.\n\nAnyways, after about a week, enough was enough and I decided to move into the bedroom upstairs and leave that hell-hole alone. It's nice upstairs because its all hardwood flooring with the occasional rug here and there. I went back down the a flaming vengeance with this cheap-ass fabric flea spray and basically used up the whole bottle spraying down the shitty-ass carpet and couch and sides of the mattress, followed by a vacuuming. It seemed to work for a bit because when I walked in the room I didn't find any of the bastards that jumped on me. I still didn't trust the room so I still just stayed upstairs. Skip forward for a couple months and a few more visits from my sister and her cats and the place is now thriving with fleas again. The cats were even flea-free before the visit so there must've been some flea eggs hidden somewhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, the fleas are starting to invade the upstairs after I made a trip downstairs to the room for a second to grab something and came back up to find my socks and shins were infested with about 20 of the little FUCKING CUNTS. Sorry, I really hate fleas. So how the fuck do we get rid of them? I live in Canada so there aren't as many options as far as bug control goes (less sprays and no bug-bombs) which fucking sucks.\nTL;DR:"}

She kicked the daughter out of her house, threw out all her stuff, took back the college fund for her, banned her from all family events and property, and forbade her other kids from talking to their sister without permission. We started dating after that and I didn't realize the whole situation. A couple months ago my girlfriend found out that her estranged daughter (who she usually refers to as \"the dyke\" without saying her name) was working at a bakery in our town. She tried several times to get the daughter fired but it didn't work. So now she is trying to make inroads with people who work at the local health department as part of a plan to eventually get the bakery closed down for health violations. She may try to plant something there. She is pretty obsessed with driving her daughter out of our town and getting back against her in whatever way she can. I don't really want to get involved in this which makes me very uncomfortable, but she hasn't asked me to get involved at all and otherwise my girlfriend is a very nice, loving person and I do love her and I don't want to lose her over her relationships with her kids which doesn't seem like its really my business. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

They had her listed as \"PG-13 Skittish\", and I wouldn't call her all that skittish. She's very meek and submissive, though very eager to please and smart as a whip. Her submissive behavior isn't what is causing a problem though, since we're working on building her trust and confidence with us and she's taking right to it.\n\nRandom things scare her--not noises, but objects. These seem to change every day. She'll be terrified of something one day and fine with it the next. I suspect this is just because she's getting used to her new home and to us, so the little things, I'm not worried about. She'll get over her terror of the dog-poop-bag-trashcan, since she's constantly exposed to it.\n\nThe other day, it was pouring when it was time for our morning walk, so I broke out the umbrella. The sound of the rain on it terrified her briefly, but she got over that after I showed her that it was okay, and we went on our walk. When we came back, however, I went to close the umbrella. NOPE. She FLIPPED OUT and pulled out of her harness (I tightened it afterward), then ran out into the rain and lay in the grass, crawling to me on her belly with some serious reservations. Luckily, she doesn't run from me and so she waited for me to come pick her soaking wet ass up and carry her into the house.\n\nI have a few questions. \n\n1.) Is this just a symptom of a fear stage? Is there anything I can do to help her along during this? \n\n2.) How can I get her not-afraid of the umbrella, which is huge and makes scary sounds?\n\nOther than her random little fears and her occasional forrays into/near the litter boxes, she is the absolute perfect pup so far, and as her confidence grows, she gets even better! I want her to be confident on rainy walks, so how can I get her used to the umbrella without scarring her forever? We do clicker train.\nTL;DR:"}

Ice and Sprite. fucking everywhere, as the lid had come off mid flight. Not only did I splash a few people, but some guy picked up an ice cube and dropped it down a girl's shirt, causing her to spill her coffee. Even worse, our school janitor was 3 feet from us, pushing her cart back to the closet because her shift was done. Oh, the look on her face when she turned around.

We support eachother through everything, live together, fill in where the other is incapable, that sort of mush. Theres just one snag...\n\nRecently, we came to the conclusion that our relationship has, for want of a better word, a deadline. We've both agreed that a long distance relationship won't work.

We decided this a few months ago, and therein lies the problem...\n\nThe last month or so has been hard. We've both been under a lot of stress, and the feelings that were there seem to have dwindled. Arguments are more frequent, amd we seem to be tiptoing around the subject, clinging on to something that isnt really there. At this point, it seems like we're only staying together out of convenience. Better we both stick together than have to share a house awkwardly. And we still love eachother, but lately it feels like back before we started, when we were two friends, but without the dicking around.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: Computer Science Program Choice\nPOST: Hello Reddit! I come today asking a question, I am currently a student at a college in the Computer Sciences - Computer Engineering program. This program is for software engineering, and basic technician capabilities (For instance my first semester is Introduction to programming, Networking Fundamentals, Operating System Fundamentals, Calculus), this is all good I have found I love programming, and end up doing my projects just for the fun of it.\n\nOn the other hand though when I signed up for the program, I thought we would do a fair bit more with networking. We do not, after the introduction to networking we don't have anymore networking courses. I also love to do networking work though.\n\nSo my problem comes down to this, Should I switch programs? The current program I am thinking of switching to is Network Technician, this is a 3 year program also, and I would just end up taking an extra summer to get 1 or 2 credits I need (as I am doing my first semester in the engineering program, and it is to late to change). Though if I go with Network Technician I lose any programming courses, and if I stick with Engineering I lose all the other networking courses. I have weighed out the pros and cons of both, and they are both subjects I thoroughly enjoy and can see my self doing either of them for a living and enjoying it. Are there any Redditors here with experience in either field (As a coder, network tech, sys admin, or something related) that can give me pointers of Pros and Cons to look at for each field in an employment sense?\nTL;DR:"}

About a year ago I met this girl in one of my classes, and slowly over the months we became great friends. She was one of the few people I could really connect to on a higher level, both socially and intellectually, which really made us grow really close this past spring. I grew really attracted to her, and thought that she felt the same way. \n\nBut I never made a move though, because there were times where she seemed to reject me if I put my arm around her, but more importantly, she was going abroad for the fall semester. We were going to be around 5 hours apart for the summer too, and it just didn't make sense for me to try something right before we each went home. \n\nThroughout the summer we talked all the time, and she visited me (and her other friend), and I did the same later. We always had great times, but again I never made a move, which of course I regret greatly. \n\nSince the summer we've talked intermittently, some days all the time, others not at all which I'm fine with. Many times I've made the decision to move on because I know I screwed up, but every time she starts talking to me it's hard to do so. \n\nSometimes we talk on a solely friend-to-friend basis but at other times she seems flirty, and it always confuses me. \n\nWhat should I do here? I feel like this is eating away at me, especially because I can't seem to move on. I thought I could wait until January when we'd see each other in person again but it's been gnawing at me so much I don't know what I should do.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [22F] SO [24M] just got out of a six year relationship and I'm caught in the middle of the post-breakup drama.\nPOST: The guy I'm seeing is absolutely fantastic - smart, interesting, kind, generous -- all of it. However, he ended a six-year relationship in early May and chaos has followed ever since. To clarify, I met him on Tinder and the only expectation either of us had was to have a short fling (I recently ended a relationship too), but it developed into much more. We are crazy about each other and have been dating pretty seriously for the past 8 weeks.\n\nWhat makes me most uncomfortable is his newly ended relationship. I have absolutely no contact with my ex; he tried to contact me and I told him not to call me again. My SO is different; his ex constantly calls him in tears and tries to manipulate him into coming over. She relies on him very much still and understandably hasn't gotten over their time together (and likely won't for a long time), which would be okay except it is intruding very much into my relationship with him. The breaking point for me was last night, when she happened to pass us in the car and ended up being physically violent towards him. She didn't know about me and he still has not told her we've been dating regularly. \n\nI should add that the two of us aren't exclusive yet. The reason we haven't progressed to exclusivity is because I want these issues resolved before starting a relationship. He assures me he's ready, but these encounters tell me it's way too soon. I feel like he won't be ready to date for at least a few months, and that I should just find someone else. I don't approve of the way he handles his ex, but don't feel the situation is as black and white as it seems. They have a long history and I know it'll take some time to figure out. To ask him to cut off all contact does not seem realistic or fair.\nTL;DR:"}

You have to know I'm very neat and tidy so first thing I got home I went to wash my hands. \nAnd as I looked into the mirror I nearly fainted. I had strange white spots all over my face.

It looked like someone had lashed my skin open, and it had healed over, but the skin that \"healed back\" was not as thick.  It developed over night, as my mother noticed it when I went swimming, and she said it wasn't there the day before.  (They were big, spanning up to the width of my back, and there were three of them.  They couldn't easily be missed once my shirt was off.)  I had no idea about it, and she got a little freaked out, but life went on.\n\nFast forward to my first year in college, when I woke up one morning with a sore spot on my lower back.  Looking in the mirror, another scar existed where none was before.  This one was about 2cm left of my spine near my hips, and was circular in shape, about 1 inch in diameter.  It hurt, not badly, and was the same sort of thin, rubbery-textured skin as my previous scars, and had, again, appeared due to no injury or other known provocation.\n\nJump ahead again to this morning.  Now I'm 30, and woke up with an abnormal pain on the back of my thigh.  Using a mirror, I found another \"healed\" scar that I'm 100% certain was not there yesterday.  It's about 4\" long, looks almost like a knife gash or something, about 2cm wide at it's widest.\n\nIn all cases, the skin is thinner and has a slightly rubbery feel.  There's no dense scar tissue, scabbing, bruising, or anything else to signify injury, other than an abnormal but mild pain immediately preceding discovery.\n\nWhat could possibly be causing these?

I guess we just got caught up in our lives) telling me she just found out she's a couple weeks pregnant. She's getting an abortion tomorrow but it's the noninvasive kind that doesn't require surgery since it's still very early on.\n\nShe asked me to stay at her place tomorrow night after she goes through with the procedure because she obviously needs a friend. Do any of you have tips on how I can comfort her or what I should do? I am pro-choice so I am very open-minded about all of this (which is probably why I was the only person besides her mother she told). I completely understand why someone would be so upset about it though but I guess I don't know the right things to say since I've never experienced something like this before.\nTL;DR:"}

But she made the move on me one day and asked me out on a date. We started talking a lot and found we both had a lot of similar interests. We saw each other every day and became really good friends. Next thing I know she invites me over. I wanted to be nice and bough some snacks since she wanted to watch a movie so the clever guy I was I bought a bag of peanuts and brought it in a plastic bag to make it make less noise while we watched the movie. Her parents weren't home. We started to watch the movie and proceeded to cuddle. We get really close to each other. I open my peanut bag a bit so I could have easy access to my snacks, later on(don't know what I was thinking should have opened it right away) and she was leaning in close on me preparing to kiss me. When suddenly. Bam.she starts to vomit all over my mouth and I get disgusted and vomit at her. I have no idea what's happening and with half choking breath she says she's allergic to peanuts. I panic and start to scream as she vomits some more. I call 911 and tell them to come over right away and she's crying. She tells me through a very tiny voice there are allergy medicine in her bag. Today I still don't know why she didn't tell me this earlier. We went to the hospital and her parents came and started yelling at me. After that I never saw them again and felt like a massive dick.\nTL;DR:"}

With trust being put aside here, whether we have trust in eachother or not, as a couple in a relationship there are just certain things that are inappropriate. To me, this situation where she would be downtown in a condo drinking with a bunch of single guys, some guys with girlfriends(that aren't there), as well as some of her girlfriends too. \n\nMy question is, am I wrong? Is it appropriate for her to do this? Things like this put a strain on a relationship no matter who is right in the situation and I just want to come to an agreement or understanding with my girlfriend. And, if I am wrong then I would much appreciate to be shown how to broaden my perspective and understand better. Thank you for reading!\nTL;DR:"}

Alright, so now she takes a break from writing her paper and we start to just small talk.

It didn't sound too crazy, so I gave a listen to everything he had to say.\n\nOver the last two days, he has been saying progressively crazier things and has become obsessed with the thoughts that:\n\n- our apartment is bugged by the government\n- the pope is running the world\n- spam email/twitter accounts are actually clues to joining an elite \"ascended\" organization\n- everywhere he goes, people are following him and testing him with cryptic messages\n- if you can get into the \"ascended\" group, you can fuck any girl you want and they'll take care of you\n- every hot girl is a \"gypsy\" and part of the group\n\nIt's so bad now that he is walking up to strangers in parking lots and asking them for more clues.  For the last couple days he has been obsessed with \"finding the answers\", and I'm afraid he's going to either get hurt or end up in jail for acting on his beliefs.  I have tried to tell him that his perception on reality isn't right, even citing examples, and he simply cannot accept it.\n\nI've known him for years, and I've never seen any prior signs of mental illness.

I have a girlfriend and she means the world to me. I love her with everything and I hope someday I marry this girl. She's everything. Our relationship is awesome. We never really \"fight\", we argue and disagree and stuff but we don't get into screaming matches. Sex is fantastic and families like each other. In other words this relationship is awesome.\n\nBut there is one problem,me. I am the worst part of our relationship. Let me give you an example. For the past few weeks she has been training at her new job to be an RA at her school.(O,btw 21 and 19. Been together for 3 years. Anyway back to the story) Now this is new to her and me and we didn't know what to expect. I've barely talked to her or seen her for this amount of time. We spend all our free time together so this absence is really hard on both of us. \n\nNow I'm more emotional then she is and this really got to me. I started thinking if this was going to be the way it was for the whole year.I come over, we have tired sex, she passes out on the bed and then she has to wake up, shoo me out to do another one of her 10 jobs besides being an RA. I've always been supportive but I feel like I'm needy and that I need someone to be there with me a lot. I confronted her about all this and she just started crying and getting all upset because it was so out of the blue and she feels like it is her fault when I know that it is mine for sure. \n\nSo I ask what do I do? I don't know if I can change, what I really need it better management on how to handle myself so it doesn't hurt her.\nTL;DR:"}

I could use some.\nPOST: Reddit, Saturday night I got very drunk at a wine festival (which was followed by a trip to the bar). I usually don't drink, so I think the alcohol affected me more than I thought it would. After I got home, I can't remember anything. \n\nI was with my boyfriend the entire time (thank god), save a few trips to the restroom. He says when I left, I was gone no more than a minute or two, but I was raped three years ago by someone who gave me the date-rape drug and even though I know my boyfriend is telling me the truth, I can't help but be terrified that someone tried to hurt me in the bathroom or something. \n\nI have absolutely no pain or reason to fear this other than that I can't **fully** remember everything that happened; I remember most of what happened at the bar, I remember checking out my tab (at 10:30 PM). We arrived there at 9:00 PM. I also remember most of my conversations that night; it wasn't until we got home that I can't remember anything. I remember most of the cab ride. Evidently, my boyfriend and I had sex and I do not remember that (this was after we got home). \n\nLogically, I know I was pretty lucid for the evening up until we got home, so if I was raped, I feel like I would've remembered. He also said I wasn't gone more than 2 minutes when I did go to the bathroom. I have no sign of rape or trauma. The bathroom was very close to people-traffic so I feel like nobody would've tried to do it anyways...All of my logic is telling me that I'm being ridiculous - Why am I so worried?

It really makes it harder to continue when it happens so much.  What am I suppose to say to her to let her know I really do care.

Last night on our way home, when he went to walk the dogs for the final time, one of them got out of its collar and ran away. The only way it would have been able to get out of its collar is if it was tugged on excessively in a direction that the dog did not want to go. This particular dog is a rescue and does not like crossing any sort of paved street since he was hit by a car before we got him.\nInstead of searching his apartment complex for the dog, he decided that he would just go inside and smoke weed instead. Since we were still on our way home, we had no way of helping the search. We finally arrived back in Arizona about 5 hours later and started searching. It took us 3 hours and thankfully we were able to find him. \nSince I was with his parents when this happened, I had to hold my tongue even though I knew he was in the wrong. \nMy question to you guys is have you ever been in a similar situation where someone close to you, family member or in-law, did something so messed up and instead of helping, they did the complete opposite.\nTL;DR:"}

I have only recently come to realize that this might be a serious problem and could mess with my life and goals.  Basically, I have trouble coming up with things to say to acquaintances or people I just met, and rarely but sometimes even closer friends.  It feels like I really just don't have the energy to talk to them or care enough to ask a lot of questions and keep a conversation going.  I deal with anxiety regularly each day even alone (chest tightens up) but it compounds when I'm out with a group of strangers.  I have tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 3 weeks now and I can't really see myself getting better to a point where I feel comfortable talking to strangers and enjoy conversing with them.  I feel like I only have 10 friends I can count on and speak freely to and it gets me depressed knowing I don't have more and can't enjoy the company of new acquaintances.\n\nIs there hope for me? If anyone has gone through CBT or have Social Anxiety Disorder, I'd love to chat with you.\nTL;DR:"}

I just can't get a read if I should just ask her out.\n\nWith the line regarding I wanted to tell her something later I wanted a clear answer rather than one where she had been drinking the whole night and me kind of chickening out on the question all together.\n\nI just don't know how to go about it now.

As of recent we had a falling out over a stupid facebook picture. Here's some background:\nShe is friends with a girl I despise. I'll call her C. Usually, I don't care. I can cope. My ex-best friend also hates my boyfriend. Which is generally fine. But today all hell broke loose.\nI told her I felt she was being insensitive to my feelings as she posted a picture of her with C as her profile picture on facebook. She asked if I wanted her to take it down. I said no, I hid your posts. It doesn't matter. But that I hope she would take it down soon because I hate looking at C's fucking face, and it made my stomach curl every time I saw it. Yes, I have some insecurities and dark issues, but so does everyone else. And generally, I can deal with them, unless they're being shoved in my face. The point is, she's completely blocked me and deleted me off of facebook. I didn't want to lose my best friend over a stupid fucking post, and a stupid fucking picture but this shit has gotten all blown out of proportion. I just want my friend back, but I don't feel the need to apologize when I haven't said anything offensive to my friend. Ex-friend. She keeps telling me that the other girl is a better friend than I am, because C has no job, so that means infinite time to spend with my friend, while I'm busting my ass trying to pay bills and fight my own evils. I'll admit I've been shitty about making time for her aside from work and my live-in boyfriend (he works also) but I can't just up and hang out with her when it's convenient for her. \nI'm at a dead end here. I don't know what to say to her to get over this. We've quarreled before but never at this magnitude. I need your help, please.\nIf it helps, this has been all over text messaging only.\nTL;DR:"}

My brother and I have been 'moved out' for around three years now and are used to the independent lifestyle. A lot of our mutual friends are finishing up school and looking to move out of their parents', including my boyfriend.\n\nThing is, my brother, our roommate and I have to move out as of August 1 so I've been looking at a lot of places. My boyfriend recently graduated university and has mentioned moving out a lot, and has also expressed interest in moving into a 4 or 5br house with us and a bunch of our friends.\n\nI'd love to live with him but I don't know if either of us are ready. We have some trouble with communicating serious issues so discussing something like this will get ignored and swept under the rug until I'm forced to bring it up. We both also really like having our own space and I can see having to share a bedroom being difficult.I was also considering he and I living in the same house but with separate bedrooms. \n\nI think he's avoiding mentioning something because I haven't mentioned something, which is making him assume I haven't been thinking about it. Alternatively, I don't think we've been dating long enough to take such a huge leap as we've moved pretty slowly thus far.\n\nAnyway, what I want to know is, what do you have to prepare yourself for upon moving in together? I have a friend who moved in with her bf after about eight months and they are extremely happy, and another friend who did the same and is very unhappy.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22/M] - are fixed ideals in men a turn-off?\nPOST: Feeling a bit apprehensive but I hope to learn by putting myself out here!\n\nI'm in college, never had a girlfriend. I was raised in a military background so there are some hardcore disciplines that my grandpa (he was a general) made me follow since I was young. And I have found that this makes me very different from a lot of guys in college - and am wondering if that is what is preventing me from being friend material vs being boyfriend material.\n\n1) My grandpa runs an orphanage and he wants to turn it over to me once he retires. It's a big responsibility and I am always thinking about the problems it may have in the future. Which of course serves to be my number 1 priority in life - but my friends say my number 1 priority should always be my girlfriend because she may be the one I marry.\n\n2) I have money and if I don't, I work to get it for you if you really need it. I give it to my close friends freely - never expecting it back. But what I do expect is a certain level of dependability in return - one of my friends was being a complete ass and I ended that friendship. It sounds kind of silly but to me if I can't trust or depend on you, I don't want you in my life. My friends say not everyone is willing to give as much as I am willing to give myself into a relationship - so I guess this is one of my faults.\n\n3) no sex before marriage - my grandpa made me focus on my studies (which is paying off- no loans is a big plus in this economy) so I never really had the experience in high school - but then again a part of me doesn't want to think about sex unless it's with a girl I really respect. My friends tell me this is a turn-off.\n\nthere are others but I think these are the big three that separate me. I don't know if the discipline is a turn-off but I'd like to know what you think. I apologize if this is not the right place to post this - I only use reddit for my engineering. if it should be removed please let me know.\nTL;DR:"}

For example, by building a puzzle or learning how to use the computer, or just walking around the block. He became offended because he assumed i was telling him how to live his life. He thinks everything you say that he densest agree with is an attack against his character and readily assumes that everyone is out to get him. Now he is angry at me because \"I am supposed to be on his side.\"\n\nI feel like he is living simply to die at this point. He doesn't leave the house, barley walks anywhere which leads to his mobility becoming worse by the day, and he doesnt do anything except watch TV, eat, sleep and occasionally talk on the phone.\n\nI don't know how to help him. It is becoming clear that he is too much for my grandmother to effectively help and that we may have to consider a nursing home.

I started the blog a year ago and used it heavily before we were together in the same sort of sexual way, however, I continued to use it after we were exclusively together, which is cheating. \n\n   I started and used the blog for self-affirmation and flirted with people who called me beautiful and professed to idolize me. I continued using it after we became exclusive because I feared that he would either not love me or fall out of love with me and leave me, and that I would be alone. I used it as a sort of safety crutch, which is pathetic. His reaction when he found out was to ask me if I had anything I wanted to tell him and when I couldn't think of anything, he became very upset. Understandably. After having calmed down though, he has decided he doesn't want to break up and that he doesn't even want me to delete the blog (though I already have), but there is no longer any trust, as he feels that I could always secretly make a new account.\n\n   I am so in love with him and I cannot stand the thought of not having him in my life as he is now, but he was very clear about certain rules. He is incredibly accepting of my eating disorder, self harm tendencies, depression, and dissociative episodes, and he said that the only things he cannot accept are cheating, lying, and me physically harming myself. I cannot justify why I kept this blog or continued to use it secretly.

I have no intention of bringing it up directly and have decided to speak through actions. I invited her to a pretty high profile after party this weekend where I will know lots of people and she will know no one - she accepted without hesitation.\n\nAfter she accepted the invite she sent me a couple long texts about how she remembers that whole night and didn't black out despite being drunk. They were entirely unprompted and irrelevant which makes me believe she was letting me know that she is standing by what she did.\n\nHere is how I see it. I need to keep the rational part of her brain out of this all together. Talking about it will just smother this spark. We obviously need to be liquored up somewhat, but not quite to the extent as were. My words need to be saying \"we're just great friends!\" but my body language and physical interactions need to communicate \"we both know this is happening\". The only way this will happen is through an irrational moment of passion which I intend to initiate.\n\nWorst Case Scenario: Misread situation and get shot down - act unaffected, laugh it off but begin freeze out.\n\nModerate Success: Make out with each other. This would be a considerable blow to the friend-zone but not enough to be clear. I'd still need to bed her.\n\nThis seems dangerous though as it makes my position clearer and possibly lets her engage the rational part of her brain later on. If she brings it up, and tries to \"re-friend-zone me\" I'd just tease her and agree that of course we're just friends and tell her not to be so serious.\n\nSuccess: Make out and take a cab home... together. After sex I'd be more open to talking honestly but only if she has the desire to talk about it. Again I'd prefer to speak with actions.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [17/m] My self-righteous girlfriend [16/f] literally tells her friends EVERYTHING\nPOST: Just like the title says, she tells them absolutely everything. What we do physically (and \"shows them\", somehow), all my texts, all the dirty talk, and more. There was this one time she wanted me to write out this scenario for her with a shower (I ended up writing this huge 1,064 word story) and she loved it. I have bad trust issues and a bad history with saying things like that because my past girlfriends would seriously get mad at me for saying anything sexual to them. It was so hard even writing that story, let alone sending it to her. She showed her friends the story and guess what they did? They laughed. She says that it wasn't laughing at me like making fun of me, but a laugh like \"oh my god he did NOT just say that\" kind of thing. Still sounds like laughing at me. Where she draws the line is apparently anything that has to do with her, she shares. But if it's something that's only me, she'll keep a secret. I tried talking to her about it but she thinks she's doing nothing wrong and then got mad at me for being upset. I tried asking if she can at least run things by me before telling her friends and she thinks that's my way of controlling what she says by making her get my permission. She seriously doesn't get how this is a violation of privacy. I don't mind her talking to her friends about me, I like that she brags. She's literally only said good things. But this has really blindsided me. I mean, what if we have sex and I can't get it up? Will she tell them that, too? Now she's not talking to me because I \"picked a fight\".

She does not qualify as a first time home buyer (previous marriage).\n\n- I do not have good credit (628) and carry about 40k in student loan debt and 1k in credit card debt.  My loans are current and in repayment.  My credit was recently torched by a federal loan that came due 6 months ago.  In short, it was consolidated **via text message** in 2011 and came due in April 2015.  My phone number and address had changed during that gap.  I would qualify as a first time home buyer.  \n\nMy questions really pertain to how to apply for financing.  How does my poor credit effect this process if we were to apply jointly?  Can anyone recommend a strategy to approach this in our situation?  Also, we are confident in our relationship but is there any financial benefit to either marriage or domestic partnership?\nTL;DR:"}

She claims that she wanted to grab drinks in order to network, whereas I told her that, at least from his end, it was a date, especially as she had not told him that she has a boyfriend. I agreed to let her go because I trust her and knew she would be careful.\n\nShe tells me the next morning that he and her got really drink at the bar and she stayed drinking with him past the point her female co-worker left. She said she was worried for the guy's well-being as he was very intoxicated at the bar, so she wanted to make sure he got back to his hotel safely. She said when they got to the hotel, she wanted to use his toilet as she was feeling sick. After this, she sat down on his bed and the guy had tried to make a move on her and tried groping her, at which point she freaked out and yelled at him and ordered him to get her a taxi, which he did and she left.\n\nShe's told me that nothing happened, and I believe her, but I still feel a little not at ease. Particularly, I find it weird that she would have even allowed herself to get that drunk around him and that she would have gone back to his hotel room in the first place, even if just to have a place to puke.

Now that it is winter, I'm pretty sure that cat makes residence under our back deck from time to time. I know this because I can smell the cat poop from under the deck, and also the paw prints in snow are a giveaway.\n\nMy problem is my cat who'd I'd label as the more assertive, maybe even dominant of the two, is pooping outside her litter box. The litter box also happens to be in our utility room, which is right where the door for the deck is. She is a perfectly healthy cat, no health problems, and this is very uncommon behavior for her.\n\nWith that, I can only assume she is not covering her poop to try and tell that stranger cat to back off her domain and not come back.

Our neighbors are a frequently-fighting couple. Their fights range from loud to very, very loud. Their favorite time to fight is from 2-4 am. \n\nHere's the problem: my wife teaches music out of our apartment, making us, technically, the noisiest neighbors in the whole building. There's no way around it. We're loud a.f. Typically my wife teaches a few lessons per day between 11 am - 8 pm. \n\nWe nicely introduce ourselves to new neighbors when they move in, explain the noise, and invite them to talk to us about it if it's a bother. So far in 5 years no one has complained, presumably because we try to be nice, we keep it within reasonable hours, and because most people are at work during most of those hours anyway.\n\nMy neighbor is a freelancer with weird hours though, and she certainly gets an earful of squaking novice vocal students. We haven't complained to our neighbors because we don't want to start a pot-kettle fight. They've got more leverage over us than we've got over them: they could actually disrupt my wife's business if they decided to counter-complain. That's why I haven't banged on the walls at 3 am and screamed, \"oh god, SHUT UP!!! GO TO SLEEP!!!\" like I want to. \n\nThis is becoming an unignorable problem though.

After lots of talking and opnening our hearts (and again I have a problem with telling my feelings), we seem to be ok again. \n\nI love him so much and I want to be a better person for him but I just can't feel se ure about myself and about us, it seems for me that everything is a potential treat to our relationship and it sure does intefere more than I'd like in our life as a couple.\nAgain thanks for reading and sorry about the terrible English, it's not my first languange :(\nTL;DR:"}

We have always been there for each-other and been supportive to ensure that everything is good for both of us.\n\nTo get to the issue, my great-grandmother have been quite bad for the past year, going back and fro to the hospital and retirement home (she was living in her own apartment at the beginning of the year). Today I found out that she was dying and I went to see her. I've been having a rather tough day and it's so hard to deal with, on top of numbing down most of my feelings as a reaction. However when it first happened all that I got as a response from my fiancee was that \"that's fucking sad\" and \"this is fucking scary\" only to not hear from her for hours. Apparently she had gone to a bar with a friend and completely ignored me for hours, only to come back and say that she \"was there\" only to leave again. Once she got back I did tell her exactly what I feel about the issue where as all she answered was \"I'm a busy persom\", which really made me question her priorities, feeling and empathy for me.\n\nSo my question is, am I overreacting or over analyzing this whole situation, or what should I do about it? This whole week and day have been crazy and I'm not sure if I'm thinking straight about it.\nTL;DR:"}

The first thing you are probably going to suggest is that I break up with her, but she's that girl that's perfect to me. She's everything I've ever wanted in a girl. Also, you're probably going to tell me it's just a teenage \"love\", but it's not.\n\nSo here's what she's said to me that's made me want to help get her over this. I asked her if she wanted to go with me and an old friend [19/f] who I've been friends with for about 5 years now. She's like my second mom and helps me with all my problems. I haven't talked to her for the past year and I asked her if she wanted to catch up and go bowling. So I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go and she said, \"No, I would just sit there quietly and I would just want to leave the whole time. I wouldn't feel like bowling I would just sit there and avoid conversations.\" Her reasonings for not wanted to meet any of my friends that are girls is that she hasn't ever liked any of her previous boyfriend's girl friends because they were fake, but she hasn't even given my friends a chance.\n\nThe second thing was I asked her if she wanted to go to a New Years party at my best friends house. She told me she didn't want to go and that she just wanted to sit at home and watch the ball drop on tv like she always does.\n\nI really want her to get to know my friends because they are really great friends and she doesn't have very many friends and I'm trying to help her be more social..\nTL;DR:"}

However, I had been reading more and more about how the market sucks for lawyers.  And I started doubting my decision to attend law school.

She wanted to talk yesterday about me going away for college in the fall (I'm going to be in New York while she finishes up highschool in the south). We ended up talking for a few hours about how hard it felt for us to be apart this summer, as I was traveling for about a month, and how hard it would be to not see each other for months at a time (I can only come back for winter break, spring break, and summer and she can't afford to go to college out of state). We were originally going to split up at the end of summer (shes afraid a long distance deal would turn our relationship from something beautiful to something ugly)  but she said that it might be best to do it now so that we can spend the summer transitioning into friends,even though she still loves me, as both her and I have agreed on multiple occasions  that saying goodbye to friends is easier than lovers, especially with all the communications of the digital age. I thought it was a good idea at the time but I'm starting to regret going through with it, she's my first love and I'm panicking that we'll drift apart as friends, or even worse I'll still love her in a few years and lose her to someone else.  I've never had a long distance relationship and I'm not sure if that would've been a better option for us, like should we have stayed together over the summer, would've the eventual breakup have been messier? Are long distance relationships actually fulfilling? Should we split up even though we still love each other?

This happened around 7 or 8 years ago when I was in the 6th grade. Keep in mind I was 12 years old at the time. A little backstory first.\n\nI attended a private school that had middle school and high school attendance. Every few years, the city police department puts together a drunk driving presentation for all of the high schools around the city, warning kids about the dangers of it. They take a smashed up car, and some fake \"dead bodies\", and create the scene of a car crash on the school campus. It's actually very cool. Now, to the fuck up.\n\nThey had the entire high school gathered in the gym, as they the police were going through a slide show presentation. The entire gym was blacked out, and there were at lease 10 cops in there. While they were giving the presentation, I had P.E. Being the dumb 12 year old I was, my friends and I thought it would be funny to take the Lazer pointer I had and shine it through the door of the gym into where the presentation was going on. \n\nSo, we did, we got a good laugh in, then we went back to changing into our PE clothes. About a minute after we shined the light, a cop bursts through the door and ask, \"who has the lazer pointer?\" Being the closest one to him, he makes eye contact with me first. I immediately fess up, nearly pissing and shitting my pants. What makes this worse, was that I wasn't even wearing pants for me to piss in, I was just in my underwear. \n\nSo, here I am, getting a lecture from a cop saying how he thought it was a gun or something, and that I need to think before I act, all the while I'm in my boxers. Great.\n\nOh, and happy 4th of July 'Murica\nTL;DR:"}

We were constantly talking and intimate.\n\nFor the first two months of our relationship, I was struggling with finding out my true motivations. She was quick to use the word love, but I feel she really meant it. I thought that since she was so beautiful that I just liked her superficially. After I came to terms with the fact that I truly loved her, everything was perfect.\n\nWe came back to college about two months ago and both of us have been really busy since (her more so than me). Right after we came back, we spent less time together than normal (to be expected). We went an entire month without being intimate. After this happened, I asked her if everything was alright, and she said things about no longer being attracted to me.\n\nWe broke up that day. The day after, I went to her room to talk it out. She said \"we're just taking a break so I can get my shit together.\" I was visibly mad about this. I wanted to be all in, or not at all. After we got back to her room, she got on top of me and started kissing me. She said she didn't sleep the night before and did a lot of thinking. She kept apologizing and saying it was hormones that made her say that she wasn't attracted to me (she took two birth control pills by accident, and her period started on that same day) and that she still loves me. I left to think about it, and caved, getting back together with her.\n\nNow that I've gotten back together with her, nothing has changed. She's apathetic about our relationship and doesn't seem to care if it ends or not. We don't hang out anymore, we're not intimate, she treats me as more of a friend over text message. She used to want to hang out with me every day, and text me all of the time. This has all stopped. She vehemently denies that it's anything other than stress that is causing her to be very distant.\n\nWhy do you think she is acting this way?\n\nCheating never happened on either side.\nTL;DR:"}

Now as I get older and feel like I could get married, and have told him so.\n\nI told him all this a year ago and he said he is willing to marry me if we wait a few years (for a total of 6-7 years) to make sure we don't fall out of love. A month ago he started going to therapy to talk about why he has such negative feelings about the idea of marriage. He says he wants more reassurance (spending quality time together etc) that we will last before we make a commitment like that. That's great to me. Maybe he means it, maybe he is stalling and really is anti-marriage.\n\nI have never seen him as marriage material and still don't/can't because of that first impression of him as a marriage-basher. He tells me people can change, he has changed (by moving in with me when he thought he would hate it, but ended up loving it). I don't want to put hope in the idea that he can change because I don't want to be disappointed. Because of this hopelessness, I get depressed whenever I think about our long term future. In my mind, if I get married it can't be to him because he doesn't truly want it. It would just be to keep me around.\n\nAll of this doubt... makes me feel like our relationship is not as great as I used to think it was. When we don't have this one problem, everything is AWESOME.

I apologized pretty soon after but he didn't want to hear it and sent me on my way...\"aren't you late?\" I apologized again this morning and said I wanted to talk about it but he replied \"why are you sorry if you meant it?\" and \"I just don't see what we have to talk about.\" \n\nShould I continue apologizing and try to explain what caused me to call his plans lame in the first place, or should I just agree that we don't need to talk and leave him alone? He has ignored me for days at a time in past fights and it's very distracting and emotionally stressful. I tend to want to resolve things immediately because I hate it when we fight (especially considering that long distance means our time together is precious). I'm afraid he'll want to break up with me because we've been fighting a lot recently. I feel pathetic that I keep finding myself in situations where I need to apologize.\nTL;DR:"}

Much appreciated!\n\nSo, essentially a friend and I are starting a small design studio together, where we hope to offer services in social marketing, print, iOS apps and websites. We're currently in the process of building everything up and should be looking for clients in around a month.\n\nI'm currently designing our website, which I hope to start building this weekend. However I've come across a bit of a pickle; the portfolio section and what I can/can't put there.\n\nNaturally I know I can put my own, personal, work in there alongside any freelance work I've completed. However, four months ago I left a job at another small design agency local to me where I had been working for eight months. I'd been designing websites, marketing materials, email newsletters and many other things that would be great to put into my portfolio. The question is, can I put this work in my new studio's portfolio. It's design work I've completed, none of the work comes under any NDA, and I'm only going to be posting the work that I did personally. \n\nIf I can, do I need to put anything accrediting the client to the company? I'm guessing so - but unsure what.\n\nI'm really in a muddle at the moment, am keen to not get in any legal trouble but at the same time want to show off as much of my work as possible.\n\nIf anyone knows, please do speak up because I'm having to halt the design until I know for sure. The past company was happy to have my work in a personal portfolio, but I haven't approached them with regard to the new studio's. I don't see why it would be any different, as it's work I've done, but I felt it best to ask here.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm really torn at the moment and I hoped you guys could help me see things in perspective.\n\nFirst of all, we've been dating for 3 years. After the first year our relationship got so serious as to moving in together, buying furniture together and everything. In the year after, we moved to a better place, we've been on various holidays (including a 3-week holiday to her family in America, which was 3 months ago).\n\nEver since the summer holiday stopped, she's been going downhill. She had a difficult past with some serious issues with her mother, including not seeing her mother. This affects her schoolwork as well, another contribution to her depressive state. \n\nYesterday, I came home and found her a mess on the couch. After a long talk we both came up with the idea to spend some time apart, seeing as we live together. She basically told me I'm wonderful and that she really doesn't wanna feel this way, but that she felt we became best friends instead of being in a relationship. \n\nI was devastated. Subconsciously I knew something was wrong after the summer holiday ended, and there's issues that I can't help her with no matter how much I could try. Just being there for her seemed like the best option.\n\nAnyway, I'm at my parents house now. We talked about having 2 weeks off, her staying at our place because she has no where else to go. I'm just wondering if there's anyone who has been through something similar. I'm just really scared and hurt right now, holding tears back as I type.\nTL;DR:"}

So, I recently graduated, got a corporate job, moved in with some good old friends, etc., etc. I get certain benefits from working with this particular company, which are awesome for me, but which would be even MORE awesome if I had someone to share them with. \n\n**Question is:** I found out that if I claim that my roommate, one of my all-time best friends and cohorts, as my domestic partner, he'd be privy to all my benefits (work perks, insurance plans, etc.). ** Would doing this be considered fraud? **\n\nFrom looking at the paperwork, there are 3 requirements:\n\n* Must have lived together for at least 6 months.\n\n* Must be financially inter-dependent.\n\n* Have a \"spouse-like\" relationship.\n\nNow, the first is a no-brainer. As for the second, the paper work says that we just need to have proof that we rely on each others' incomes. E.g. shared bank account, co-signed lease/mortgage, etc, which we do to an extent already (no shared bank acct, though). \n\nThe third is very open-ended it seems to me. The paperwork even has the quotations as I've marked them. Weird. I mean, does cooking and cleaning for each other count? Hanging out almost every night? Don't know.\n\nAnother big impetus for this is the fact that my roommate currently has no insurance through his job. It'd be a huge boon to him to be covered on an actual plan, even if only at a basic level.\n\nSo, anyone with any experience with this? Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I only realized my fuck-up when my other bus arrived, as the driver asked if the black suitcase belonged to someone from his vehicle. Every traveler claimed it wasn't his, then someone said \"It was already here when we arrived, someone must have forgotten it from the previous bus.\"\n\n***Oh shit***.

Laura is 17 and lives at home with her mother and father.  She's told me many stories in the past about her father being emotionally abusive to her, and her mother being an enabler for this kind of behavior, which I've always watched out for, being a survivor of abuse myself.  Things crossed lines to new levels yesterday though.\n\nYesterday she got into a verbal argument with her dad, which happens pretty often.  It escalated though, and according to her he charged her, picked her up by the throat, threw her down, and punched her in the face several times.  I came over shortly after this, after he had left the house, and there were bumps on her face, as well as scratches on her arm and neck.  Her mom and brother were both very dismissive of this, placing the blame on Laura for \"having an attitude\" and \"making her father angry enough to have to do that\" and hearing that, in person, out of their mouths just enraged and disgusted me.  At one point they made me leave so they could have some \"family time\", whatever that means it couldn't be good.\n\nLaura revealed to me that this physical escalation happens a few times a year, the threats of physical escalation are constant, and this has been a pattern her whole life, and she is very scared to involve the police because her parents have both said that they will deny everything if the cops get involved.  I'm on the brink of calling them anyway, because it's still a good 6 months until she turns 18 and it hurts to think of her feeling scared and trapped in that environment for any longer.  I just don't know what to do, but I care about Laura a LOT and I want to do anything I can to separate her from her abusers.\nTL;DR:"}

Any other options for establishing credit?\nPOST: I applied for a Capital One Secured credit card because I read on this subreddit that they are usually good for people with no credit. I'm a 19 year old college student, and when I looked at my credit report last year it was completely blank. I expected that much, I haven't really tried to build credit. So, they denied my application because of a lack of income. I've worked part time since I was 16 and just recently got a full-time job making $10 an hour over the summer, but will go back to maybe 10 hours a week during the school year. I filled in on the application that I make $5000 a year because that's about what I made last year working part time, and I didn't want to \"forecast\" what i'll be making at this job because I thought what I will make isn't the same as what I've made in the past.\n\nSo basically, I got denied a secured card, which I thought was the thing to get if you have no credit. I was wondering what other options do I have for building credit? I've heard getting a parent to cosign an auto loan, but I already have a car and my parents didn't think to have my cosign the loan for it. And do I have any other options as far as credit cards go? A credit card seems like the most feasible, convenient option. Also, I like to invest a good portion of my money in a service called Acorns. It's returns aren't really high but it's better than a savings (no fees either), except it's less liquid (takes 5-7 business days to transfer money back to my checking), so a credit card would be nice in the case of an emergency so that I could pay for something now and I won't have to worry about waiting a week for the money to get in my checkings account. So, if there are any other cards that are more lenient on lower income that'd be nice, but I might just have to build credit another way and then apply for a credit card once I have something.\nTL;DR:"}

He was nice to me, but he must have noticed the way I looked at him and was like \"there's something I need to tell you\". He told me that he reunited with his ex. I then proceeded to confess my feelings and almost cried in the process. It had to say it several times before he realized that this is as serious as I mean. He understood what I feel but he wasn't [at that time] able to properly respond to such feelings, so he just kept saying \"sorry\". He also asked if we can be friends, and I replied that there's no way to friendship from the feelings I have.\n\nAfter that, we didn't communicate in any way for almost a month.\n\nThen I couldn't hold it any more and just sent him a message saying \"good morning\" one day, pretending nothing happened.

Then I opened up his Facebook profile yesterday and saw an \"end of relationship\" post that he posted in the end of August but backdated to February (when we started).

This explained why he became slightly flirtier in conversations with me in the past weeks.\n\nBut what I don't understand is how do I make that into an actual relationship. Should I just take him on a date whenever possible or should I wait for his initiative? How do I understand when he's ready for me? How is it going to work out provided he knows about my feelings towards him? How do I make it clear to him that the said feelings are still there, and do I even need to?

She does not respect him, especially in front of us and it's awkward to watch your brother be belittled in front of the entire family\n2.

But I feel pretty strongly that if my family told me they didn't like my partner, I'd tell them to fuck off and never speak to them again.

It makes me feel bad when you do not practice basic hygiene.\" to which he rolled his eyes and laughed.\n\nWe have a perfect relationship other than this, so no, I am not going to do anything silly like break up with him. What other ways can I phrase this so that he listens? I do not want to have to be nagging him all the time to do things that he should, as an adult, be doing. He is a big time stoner as well, perhaps this makes him more careless/forgetful than others. **He is not depressed.** He sees this as me trying to change him.\nTL;DR:"}

He's at a job he hates in a city I hate and he only likes a little bit.  He's openly said that the reason he doesn't want to move here to be with me is that he's scared of losing his social support networks-friends he's hung out with for years. This is of course an entirely valid concern-needing to make new friends in a new place is an intimidating thing. He also suffers from social anxiety, which obviously makes it more difficult.\n\nI'm planning on taking him to special interest social groups (gamer groups, anime groups, metal fan groups, etc) to try and help him meet people he can form new friendships with (then leaving the groups myself because its important for him to have friends and spaces he can go to without me-I'd just be going initially because he'd be too shy to go to something alone until he'd already met people there), but I'm not sure how effective this will be.\n\nI'm looking for any advice as to how to make this easier and more effective.

Doug stayed with me longer than his siblings due to a long list of medical problems (dehydration, malnutrition, mange, etc.) After feeding him puppy formula with a syringe day after day, sleeping in the floor with him to keep him on a heating pad, and one terrifying night where my husband (a paramedic) had to give him cpr on our way to the ER vet, I just couldn't let him go. \n\nThe problem: Doug started out as a 5 pound puppy that fit in the palm of my hand. He is now a whopping 80 pound \"bull in a china shop.\" My other two dogs are a 9 year old dachshund and a 4 year old dachshund. Doug has NO concept of how big he is! He is an angel with my one year old daughter, but he is a big, happy puppy that has knocked her off her wobbly feet a time or two.

I was so focused on his recovery that I didn't devote the necessary attention to his training. Now I am in a pickle. If I introduce proper training now, will it stick?

I then suggested a few alternative (including but not limited to me sleeping somewhere else for one night on the weekend and the other could be a quiet night at the apartment.

Later along the road in her new relationship they became a couple.\n\nIt only took a couple weeks before realizing that the new person I thought I'd like wasn't the one for me and that I was missing my ex. I decided to break ties with the new girl and started talking to my ex once again and she ended up falling for me again as well. I found out about her new SO and our friendship became complicated. Apparently her SO doesn't give her much attention, so we had a lot of time to spend together.\n\nAround August/September of last year our friendship became very intimate and in the end turned sexual probably because of the fact that she gave most of her attention to me instead of her SO. She tells me she still wants us to be close, but she loves her SO.\n\nMonths pass, we still pretty much do everything together, other than the times she's with her SO. There were a couple times where we talked about our situation and I asked her what exactly was I to her. Is being a third wheel a tool? I know what we're doing is wrong, but I still think I'm in love with her.\n\nA couple weeks ago she tells me she's almost on that level where she'd love me again, so that made me pretty happy. Then a couple days ago she was out drinking with her friends and SO. She got drunk and they ended up having sex. She told me the next day because she didn't want to hide it from me. Now I can't get the thought of it out of my head and it sucks. Should I even be affected by this since I'm the extra. She's cheating on him with me and not the other way around.\nTL;DR:"}

She is studying abroad in my country. If you ask me what I am searching in a woman, I would describe her. We had dinner first, than went to the movies and had a drink afterwards.\n\nNow heres my problem; during dinner she mentioned she still had a boyfriend back home. So the evening just went on, and we had a really good time. After the movie we went for another drink, and we got on the topic of relationships. She told me she doesnt really beleive in LDR's, and she said 'maybe for 5 months it could be possible'. The 5 months are the time that she is here.\n\nNow my question, if I like her; how do I get to the point from here that she starts liking me in a romantic way?

I'm kind of a father figure in her eyes (at least it seems that way to me) Her actual dad ran out on her and her mom and she was never really taught anything about how guys are and how to deal with them, so I had to teach her some things about how she's dealt with guys in her past were all wrong and woefully misguided and among other things it just feels like too much pressure for me after all I'm only 18, I have my whole life to live, but in her eyes, I'm already \"The One.\" \n\nAnother reason I feel like I should tread lightly is due to her past relationships, her main one ended about a year ago and she was with total scum he was a huge asshole to her and her mom.\n\n What I got from what she told me about her relationship with him, is that it seemed like she was practically his property throughout the duration of their \"relationship.\" She even got a tattoo of their anniversary on her wrist (which is now covered up by a painfully ironic tattoo.) \n\nAccording to her she's been treated like shit her whole life, and it's hard to argue with that but it's somewhat her fault for staying with her last boyfriend for almost 2 years and the reason she loves me so much is because I treat her like she's a human being, but that's pretty much the same way I treat everybody, and she put me up on this pedestal of the right way you  should be treated and treat someone, but that's just it, I'm not this super nice guy, I'm just a normal dude, but don't get me wrong I'm no asshole thou, it's just a lot of pressure for me to be this prefect person.\nTL;DR:"}

I was considerably younger then him when we met and was naive about the nature of a healthy relationship. He treated me like garbage controlling almost all aspects of the relationship. He would yell at me in the street and at restaurants so that I'd be publicly humiliated in front of strangers, but would dote on me and be very affectionate in front of friends. He would constantly make sure that I felt insecure and stupid. He never hit me but once kicked his roommates dog when it became protective of me during one of his screaming tirades. He did however put me in sexual situations that I did not feel comfortable in, and once after some very aggressive, unpleasant, sex said \"well that felt rapey.\" but did not apologize or seem particularly bothered.\n\nAll that being said, I am constantly bothered by the fact that he gets to go around thinking that he was good to me, that he wasn't a horrible, cruel, misogynist, who has made it incredibly hard for me to see a future in any relationships. I have recently entered a new relationship, and I am constantly flinching and apologizing for even the most minute things because of the way he treated me and it makes me wish that I'd never met him. I can't seem to shake this anger, it's very consuming and what I really want to do is confront him (not in person I was thinking a letter or email). However I know this would probably be a bad idea but I don't know how else to get rid of these feelings.\n\nSorry for the length.\nTL;DR:"}

We have been through long-distance at various points of our relationship, and have made it through them successfully. \n\nWe were in talks of moving in together and creating a life together until I got extremely drunk one night three weeks ago and kissed another guy (a stranger, who I have no way to contact, or any desire to really). I confessed to him the following night, after a day of non-stop crying. I know I have made a gigantic mistake and he is obviously hurt (he asked me not to contact him for the first few days), but we have made the decision to stay together and work through it. We weren't at the best place when this happened (I was feeling lonely and under appreciated by him), but I truly do regret it, and I'm willing to work hard to make our relationship flourish.\n\nWe were living together in my dorm until this happened, and he has proceeded to move back into his room.

If I don't know someone, I feel no connection to them whatsoever, nor do I feel any need to be connected to them. \n\nI have a group of friends with whom I was lucky enough to have made a strong bond with. It's a group of people that often show up to parties that I started going to with one or two close friends from high school. At first I had no desire to get to know them, but after a year or so of seeing them around, I came to know them and like them very much, I'm sure they feel the same way towards me, and I see many of them outside of party situations on a regular basis.\n\nIf I see someone regularly, this seems to be the only way I can come to really care about them. This has been a huge impediment to finding someone to be in a relationship with. My schedule is weird, and so for a while I did the online dating thing. I got a few dates, but never feel a connection. And why should I? These people are strangers to me. This isn't secluded to girls I meet from the internet. I just don't care to know someone unless I've already known them for awhile. I see other people meet and form a connection quickly, and it just boggles my mind. They don't know each other, this \"connection\" they feel can't be anything other than superficial, but that doesn't seem to even occur to them. \n\nThere is a process it seems everyone can do but me: meet someone, feel initial attraction, then mutual attraction or some \"spark,\" escalate relationship through swapping phone numbers/hanging out more, become very excited about this budding relationship, and see where it goes. \n\nIt doesn't happen for me. I'm 29. I thought it would change by now. But it hasn't, and I'm starting to become concerned. Is this a problem, or just how I am? Is this problem common? Have any of you dealt with it?

I know that the weight loss won't be exclusively fat as there are other fat-supporting structures that will shrink with weight loss.  But it's mostly fat, right?\n\nAccording to the 1.98lb per liter rule, that means that my body should shrink by approximately 60/1.98lb liters, which is almost *30 liters*.

I've really struggled to meet anyone that I've really connected with, until recently. A few months ago I was on a work assignment abroad with a group of people for 8 weeks, and one of them was a person I'll call Mark. Mark is in every way my dream companion. He is funny, good looking, successful, smart and very very passionate about what he does. He has ambition and drive but still manages to be a down to earth and sweet person. He has been with his girlfriend for a few years.\n\nWe became very close, lots of hanging out and long, meaningful conversations and I developed a big crush on him. In the strange environment that we exist in, we leaned on each other a lot for support. He said often that he felt the same way about me, he loved my company. He made me laugh, we had stupid nicknames for each other. On one occasion after drinking we kissed for a few seconds, but this was all physically that happened. \n\nWhile I have no interest in chasing after a guy with a girlfriend, and certainly no interest in being the other woman - I can't get him out of my head. Since we got home we have exchanged some short messages but it hasn't ever been the same. I'm kind of realising maybe he liked the attention and the emotional support, and now doesn't need me anymore that he is home. And that smarts a little.\n\nWe don't live anywhere near each other and won't be meeting up on a regular basis. So to make it clear its not going to develop into anything further.\n\nHow do I move forward and forget about him? We may have to work together in the future so it isn't as easy as cutting contact altogether.

I soon met another girl and from the first time we talked I knew we would be friends. That friendship quickly developed into me really liking this girl a whole lot...we had classes together and would meet to do homework and had a great time together. We have a ton in common and I felt like I finally found a girl I could be in a relationship with (this has always been rare for me). However one day in casual conversation she mentions she has a boyfriend- a long distance relationship where he's in another country. She never mentioned him before and never indicated she was in a relationship; she told me about how he would be moving to the United States this January (though still would be long distance). So naturally I was very discouraged but I couldn't help myself from really liking this girl...she was perfect in my eyes and I couldn't get over it. I also really enjoyed just being friends with her but in my mind I always hoped for more. I irrationally thought maybe she and this guy would break up and I would have a chance with her. Fast Forward to this semester: we have a few classes together again and I can already tell it will be a semester of us studying a lot together and spending time together- which is great but it's really killing me to do all of that knowing that we will never be anything more than friends and that she will never think of me how I think of her. So, I really need advice of what I should do? I need to figure out how to just accept that we are only friends and that there is nothing between us...if I could just get over her I think I'd be happy with our friendship. I wish I could tell her how I feel but I know it would ruin our friendship and I don't want that.

After 3 months with no luck I began playing with the idea of just sticking to my original plan and returning to the UK for work (British citizen). \n\nI cocked up soon after by going out and leaving my computer unlocked. My partner noted that I signed on to an instant messaging service whilst I was meant to be out. Two days later, I noticed my passport was missing and genuinely thought I could have misplaced it. Soon after, I went through my browser history to find someone had gone through my private messages on facebook (where I've discussed my plans to leave), my emails, and my conversation logs with my partner (who they're not meant to know about). I'm sceptical that it's a mere coincidence and believe my mother has hidden it as I've searched the house thoroughly and it hasn't turned up for a week. \n\n I come from a religious family where a female is expected to do as she's told by her family, and only move out when she gets married off so she can do as she's told by her husband, and well....fuck that shit? I want to be able to live my own life and not adhere to the rules of a religious text that i don't believe in.\n\nLocal British embassy is shut until Tuesday and I feel somewhat trapped.\n\nHow can I get back to the UK as soon as possible? Without involving police ideally? =/\nTL;DR:"}

She asked me to get it for her, and it was her friend saying \"Hey gorgeous\". Now, I asked her about it, and she told me thats just how he talks to her and that they're good friends. At this point my BS meter is going off the chain. I know he doesn't see her as a friend because of how he talked to her ( i may have done some slight snooping, I know shame on me) and it really bothers me. She didn't flirt back, but she wasn't exactly shutting it down either. I see this stuff as a sort of respect thing, and I don't let anyone flirt with me (I'm nice about it, I'm not a total jerk). I like keeping this stuff between me and my SO, it makes it more special in a way. We talked about it and she seemed to agree with me, but i don't know if it was okay for me to ask that of her. I'm just wondering what that looks like from both a woman's perspective and anyone else really.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Possible relationship between overeating/binging and iron deficiency?\nPOST: Hi all! First, thanks so much for being such an awesome sub. You have been such an inspiration to for me so far.\n\nI wanted to share something I have noticed about my own patterns and see if anyone has any knowledge on the subject or similar experiences. For background, I (F/18) have had iron deficient anemia since puberty, and take the iron supplement, Palafer, daily. I have suffered with bulimia for six years and am finally well into recovery (which unfortunately means weight gain), and am able to healthfully lose a little of the extra weight I've gained since getting ED help. I have been tracking my calories on MyFitnessPal and I also record when I take Palafer each night so I can be sure I took it and don't accidentally take two.\n\nUsually, I am very good at handling cravings and ignoring that voice that tells me to overeat or binge. However, over the last few months I have had a few slip ups where I can not seem to overcome these feelings and eventually end up giving in. I had one of those days again today, and after logging the extra food, I happened to be looking at a chart on MFP that shows my calories consumed over the last 90 days. I only had about 6 days that were significantly over my set caloric limit so it wasn't so bad. I don't know what made me do this, but I decided to compare this chart with my record of taking Palafer. I noticed that every time I overate, I had forgotten to take my Palafer the previous night. These were the only nights I forgot to take the supplement. So basically I observed: Ambrosiapie forgets Palafer, ambrosiapie overeats the next day.\n\nIs this just a crazy random happenstance? Has anyone else noticed anything similar, forgetting supplements then overeating the next day? I am interested to know if this is purely coincidental or if it actually makes a difference. Google has not been very helpful for me.\nLet me know if this should be in a different sub.\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

The stray cat and my cat were fighting when I woke up in a daze. I shooed the stray out, and it left my cat in a weird state where he would growl. Fast forward to the next morning, and he was fine, but he had a little limp from the fight. It was very clear that my cat built a deep hatred for the stray.\n\nOver the course of time, the stray would come to my back porch behind the glass and my cat would just go nuts hissing and just acting completely out of the ordinary. Fast forward to last night and the stray found it's way to my back porch. I go to try and calm my cat down and shoo the stray away and my cat attacked me! He never has attacked anyone other than his little play mice and toys, and such. \n\nI guess he went into a state of panic, but he definitely got me good. He has all his claws and has this nifty scratching post, so I guess they keep his claws strong and sharp. He even tried to go at my leg one other time until I just let him do his thing and didn't bother him. He is a super friendly cat, but my thoughts are that this stray kind of messed with him a bit. \n\nHe was fine about 20 mins after the incident occurred. Almost like nothing occurred. He was fine this morning and when I stopped by for lunch.\n\nThis is just so odd because he has been the most even keeled cat in the 5+ years I've had him.\n\nJust curious what you guys would do in this situation? I sprayed some of that bitter apple stuff around my back porch perimeter and also called the apartment company to see what their protocol is.\nTL;DR:"}

She is pretty incredible, everything I want, yadda yadda. Our relationship is great. Recently something that happened quite a while ago has been bothering me a little bit that I had pushed to the back of my mind.\n\nSo back about 6 months ago, I jumped onto her laptop to do something (normal) and when she closed the chrome page she had open, a downloaded picture of a guy was there. She deleted it super fast like she didnt want me to see it and mumbled something about not knowing how that got there. Now I know this guy, he goes to our college and him and I are somewhat friends, say hi to each other what not. Not very close. Well her sorority and his frat were partners for a weekend thing and they had met and became friends right before this happened. And we had been in a big fight the weekend before and barely spoke. What weirded me out was that this picture appeared to be downloaded from FB or something, which is really odd. I had I suppose pushed it out of my mind at the time and it just came back to me over break.\n\nI feel like I'm being a bit crazy here by letting this bother me, but I can't find a way to justify why it was there. And why she was secretive about it. I have a tendency to be pretty protective and jealous, and this is just bugging me and I can't shake a bad feeling. Even though I don't think anything would have happened as my GF appears to be extremely faithful.\n\nI am thinking of just casually bringing it up next time we are together to gauge her response.

I had a hard time picking up any signals and wasn't getting a strong 'yes' or 'no' vibe. I was trying to convey as best I could that I was interested, without seeming...well, awkward like I felt. We were doing the whole \"get to know you\" dance, but whenever it got quiet things they seemed a little uncomfortable, so I would bring up whatever other topic came to mind, even if it was totally unrelated. \n\nFor some reason, I thought it would be a great idea to talk about the site we used to find each other. I don't know why, I guess I was tired/anxious, but the words that came out of my mouth were: \"How do you like the site?\" \"What do you think of (some feature)?\" and then my favorite, \"Do you think I should stick with it?\"\n\nYep, I basically said, \"I'm really not interested in you.\" \n\nI could see the surprise when I asked that, and immediately knew it was a stupid thing to say, but what could I do?

Husband can't drive up to get them without me (his car has no air conditioning). My car needs some maintenance done, and since it's a manual, I'm the only one that could drive it. If they fly in to City #2, we wouldn't get there until 1am, and we'd probably have to spend the night on a hotel that we can't afford, then drive 5 hours back to our city the next day OR spend the weekend in City #3 which is a midpoint and would cost us more $ on hotels.\n\nI want to suggest that if this scenario occurs, they rent a car and drive down. Does this make me a bad host? They are not spending much money on the flight and both have more money than us. Buut they're flying in to see us. Should we rent a car to go up there?

The two mutual friends have also noticed that a lot of Pat's original personality is being actively suppressed by Roy (passing Pat's legitimate creative pursuits off as \"fads that'll disappear soon\", encouraging unhealthy eating, and using emotion-heavy tactics to force Pat to agree with him). \n\nThe mutual friends both came out and discussed this with me saying that Roy appears to be making the small flatting disagreement into a much larger issue than it really is and appears to be trying to force some kind of conflict between Pat and I. I don't understand what Roy is trying to do...but it's making life difficult between Pat and I. Both the mutual friends expressed concern over Roy emotionally manipulating Pat (who is an incredibly kind, sweet, generous guy).\n\nTonight I'm going to have a discussion with Pat about him wanting to move out, but after that is finished, I want to have a chat with just him about how he feels about his relationship. I'm really worried about him.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My (22F) boyfriend (23M) of 5 years suffers from depression.. and I'm at the end of my rope.\nPOST: My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been dating for about 5.5 years. About 2 years ago he started slipping into a depression. I have depression in my family, and also study mental health, so I recognized it right away. I never stopped showing him love and support but he became an absolutely miserable person. He refused to go to a doctor or counsellor and try to help himself, and denied there was something wrong. After a long while, I left and we broke up for 6 months.\n\nDuring that six months, he smartened up. He went to a counsellor and got help, and things were looking great. He begged me to take him back, he loved me, regretted hurting me, yadda yadda. We did end up getting back together and at the beginning of that, things were absolutely fantastic.\n\nUntil -- you guessed it -- he stopped going to counselling, and things have slipped right back to where they were before, and then some. It has been about a year since we got back together. He has completely checked out emotionally. I love him with all my heart and it is so incredibly painful to see him like this, but I can't make him get help, he needs to do it himself.\n\nI can't shake the feeling that I am being so selfish in thinking about \"me\" in this situation. I couldn't tell you the last time he gave me a compliment, or actually shared feelings with me. I try to talk to him and tell him how I feel but all he can manage is an \"ok\" or \"sorry\". When he is happy, he is the the perfect partner and I've never been happier. I want that person back, but I don't know how to help, and can't continue to be the loving, supportive girlfriend who is getting absolutely nothing in return. I don't know what to do.\n\nYes -- I have checked out /r/depression, but it doesn't really seem like a place that would help me with a relationship issue?\nTL;DR:"}

There was around 1000-2000 people there. There were people fighting over shit, and snatching other peoples stuff. There were 3 lines at the video games place in walmart. One line for xbox 360, ps3, wii. Sadly no pc line. The only game I saw was farming simulator 2011. I went into the xbox line waiting for assassins creed 3 and only a couple of copies were left. I ended up getting one of the last ones in my hand but then realized its out of pc and I should just get it there. So I went where all the people were waiting for the video games were and held up assassins creed high and someone asked \"where did you find it ?\"..... \"I got it from the line but here, take it, I'm not gonna need it\" I answered. He than thanked me. After that, I ended up finding red dead redemption. I walked up to the line for the cashier and around 50 people were in front of me. A women asked me if I can hold her stuff because she forgot something (because if I didn't hold it, she wouldn't be in the same place in line), so I held her stuff and then she came back.\nTL;DR:"}

I decided I would light a few candles and strategically place them around the apartment. One such candle was placed on the end table next to the couch. Forgetting about this, one of the cats jumped up to the armrest and I was casually petting him when I started to smell the oh so awful scent of burning hair. I looked over the armrest and noticed the candle flame looked a lot larger than before. Then I realized that his tail had been resting in the candle and was aflame. I of course immediately flipped out and patted his tail as I shooed him off the armrest and lucky no major damage was done. Just an ugly burnt tail. My girlfriend of course was not happy with me putting candles anywhere that her cats can reach, so I'm not allowed to play with fire anymore... The worst part is I started trying to make the apartment smell better but instead of kitty litter and cat piss it now smells of burnt cat.\nTL;DR:"}

I've heard from friends he is also planning on proposing to me which makes me super excited, because if it happens I know i'll say yes. I want to spend my life with him. He ticks all the check boxes.\n\nHere's where i'm worried. When we started dating he was a virgin and I was not. I had 2 sexual partners before him. Early on in the relationship we discussed things like sexual encounters and whatnot and he told me he was never into meaningless sex or one night stands and would rather make love and lose his virginity to the right girl. I found this so endearing and it was actually a massive plus in my eyes. We ended up making love and he lost his virginity to me.\n\nThe one thing that is on my mind is that, I lost my virginity to someone I regret doing it with, and after that I had a drunken sexual encounter, while he was able to hold off for 22 years of his life.\n\nI guess my question is such: I want him to feel like he made the right decision and make him feel special, like I'm also giving him something...

I am in a relationship with a girl who I really love and care about. Its been tough though because we've both come from abusive backgrounds and both don't have support from other people. Frankly we've been codependent and depressed ever since we became a long distance. We've been great at addressing and dealing with this but as I spend a semester abroad and near the end of my time in college, I want more and feel like I have missed out. I haven't engaged people or classes or life while I've been in college and while this isn't all the relationships fault its been a burden and often the straw that I feel has kept me down as I deal with my finally being at a point in my life where I am unpacking who I am without abusive situations. \nI really want to take another year at school even though its not fiscally responsible because I feel as though I need a straight year in a location where I can flourish. I want to be unburdened and in a college environment. I am also starting to development strong feelings that I have missed out sexually or want to have sex with more people. We were supposed to be semi open but that fell away when it hurt her feelings.\nThis flies in the face of our relationships goals. The general contract has been I graduate, we get an apartment, we are happy because we are not long distance, puppies and babies. Our relationship is really precious to me, I love her and I want all of this in some way, but it feels like the fun and my time to experience certain things has been completely sucked out by distance and her insecurities.\nTL;DR:"}

There was one time he spent months getting healthy and he dropped a lot of weight but now he has put it all back on again.\n\nHe also suffers from depression and for the last few months he has been at his worse so I know its not easy for him. It's just so hard because I know if he ate right and portion controlled and lost the weight he would feel amazing. I have tried getting him to see a therapist but he won't and I only just managed to get him to take anti-depressants\n\nHe is showing no signs of wanting to lose it either. I feel like I am nagging him because I spoke to him once and told him how I felt and hes not changing. He says he will but then goes and eats massive meals.

Next thing I know she invites me over. I wanted to be nice and bough some snacks since she wanted to watch a movie so the clever guy I was I bought a bag of peanuts and brought it in a plastic bag to make it make less noise while we watched the movie.

I open my peanut bag a bit so I could have easy access to my snacks, later on(don't know what I was thinking should have opened it right away) and she was leaning in close on me preparing to kiss me. When suddenly. Bam.she starts to vomit all over my mouth and I get disgusted and vomit at her. I have no idea what's happening and with half choking breath she says she's allergic to peanuts. I panic and start to scream as she vomits some more. I call 911 and tell them to come over right away and she's crying. She tells me through a very tiny voice there are allergy medicine in her bag. Today I still don't know why she didn't tell me this earlier. We went to the hospital and her parents came and started yelling at me.

When we stay at her parents house we have to sleep in different rooms, this is weird to me but I am okay with the boundaries set at others households.\n\nAbout 1 month into our relationship we first had sex.

I used being exhausted/tired as an excuse (which does contribute to the difficulty of making convos) and now she's buying me coffee and other drinks when we see each other. I'm not that bad socially but all my friends have had some sort of common interest with me, and they were always video games, music, drums, biking, drawing, etc. so talking was easy, with a myriad of people. But her one and only big interest/hobby is writing, seriously, so we have to talk about our day, music, books, and other stuff I'm not well versed in. And we have nothing in common regarding those sorts of things besides liking Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nI don't know how to get past my feelings being the mess of hormones that I am.

There I was in middle school, at the end of the day. My stomach started to bubble, I raised my hand to be excused to the bathroom, my teacher rejected my plea. Ten minutes passed and my stomach started to knot! I once again begged my teacher to excuse me, the bitch denied me again! With 5 minutes left in class, I couldn't hold it any longer. In the middle of class, I let out a fart followed by a flow of runny shit. I got up and ran to the bathroom, ignoring my teachers screams the whole way out of the classroom. I got to the bathroom and realized the damage that I had done. There was no cleaning this up! I paniced! So I started stuffing toilet paper into my shorts. Why, I don't know! I then ran out of the bathroom towards the front office of the school. Btw while I was in the bathroom school was released so the hallways were packed. Running through the halls I could here people yell, \"OMG! Whats that smell!\" I was halfway to the office when IT HAPPENED... The toilet paper that I ever so cleverly stuffed into my shorts, began to fall out of the bottom of my shorts, covered in shit! Next thing I know, I hear a girl yell, \" Look at that Kid!\" while pointing at me! Everyone stared at me standing there with shitty toilet paper hanging from my shorts. I yelled the first thing that came to my head. \"I GOT PROBLEMS OKAY!\" I then turned and ran to the office while the halls of the school erupted in laughter. I sat in the office bathroom for 45 minutes, until my grandma came to pick me up with clean clothes. Most embarrasing day of my life! But I got a funny story out of it!\nTL;DR:"}

He has been employed for several months now, and we work together on the night shift fairly often. However, we are merely co-workers. I don't consider him a friend or even acquaintance. I don't flirt with him or lead him on in any way. In fact, we only really chat in passing.\n\nOver the past week or so, I've noticed that this co-worker has been getting more touchy-feely. He comes up behind me and rubs my shoulders, or he'll touch my arm when he walks by. He started calling me 'sweetheart' and 'babe'. It was annoying but he seemed to do it to everyone so I figured it was just a quirk of his. \n\nLast night, I was by myself in the office doing some paperwork. My co-worker came up behind me and suddenly kissed me on the cheek. I asked \"What was that for?\" and he just walked away. At first it didn't bother me, but as the night went on I started to feel a little violated, and I noticed that I got really nervous when I was alone near my co-worker. The way I see it, if he thinks he can come up and kiss me out of nowhere, what else will he think it's okay to do?\n\nI told my manager, who I am very close with. She asked if I wanted to report him or press charges. I really don't know what to do. Reporting him would mean a lot of drama, possibly him getting fired, and possible retaliation from him. \n\nMy co-workers seem to agree that the situation is creepy, but they also believe that I'm overthinking it. What would you do about this?\nTL;DR:"}

She wants to take a break during that time...\nPOST: So, I met this girl on OKC about 6-7 months ago and we immediately clicked. We have had our ups and downs for the past couple months, but we are always so honest with eachother and always find a way to fix it with communication. I am 20 (not in college) and she is 17 (planning on going to college) and during that time she wants to take some time to experience the college life without feeling tied down. We really are very attached to one another and we talk about getting married in the future and having a family and what not when we're older. Which is why I completely understand why she wants to take this break at some point! If we truly do want to spend our lives together when we're older and feel comfortable with it, then we both will need to experience more things and explore our options so we don't regret it later on and resent eachother. I feel that as long as we continue with our honesty, trustworthy-ness, and effective communication then this could work. We plan on telling eachother EVERYTHING. Every person we see, every person we potentially sleep with, etc. If we keep things like that from one another, then that's a bad sign that we are, or one of us, is moving on. I feel that this could work out in the end. She says she doesn't necessarily want another boyfriend, but she may want to see other people (casual sex). I love that we can talk about this and both be on the same page about it. I just wanted to know what you guys think about this whole thing. Although, I'm sure it's a pretty common issue. I have good feelings about this relationship, although I still get sad when I think about her leaving. Wish us luck! Any advice is well appreciated :)\nTL;DR:"}

The pain went away after a few months, but no doctor ever figured out what it was. I went paleo for a while and it helped with the pain but no real diagnoses. I personally believe they were Ulcers.\n\n3 months ago\nI have had a cough for about 3 months now that does not go away. I first got it during finals week (stress) when I got caught in the rain. I kept coughing pretty hard for a few days then it died down a bit but I still continued to cough. It got worse when I was in cold places and when I drank cold drinks. I visited a doctor and get x-rays and everything checked out. I did not have a blockage and my lungs and throat were clear.\n\n1 month ago\nSomeone suggested that maybe something in my throat ruptured and I cough whenever it's irritated. Perhaps it ruptured when I was initially sick and the cough did not go away for that reason.\n\nFew days ago:\nI am in college where I drink on occasion and when I drink I do over hours at a time. However, I was at a music festival a few weeks ago and I drank a lot in a short amount of time (before I could walk into the festival). I kept throwing up and I was blacking out. EMTs got me and got worried when i was vomiting blood. It wasn't a whole lot, just enough to get people worried. \n\nNow: I still have a cough that sounds like it is \"deeper\" (if that makes sense) than before. When I laugh, inhale deeply or cough I have a pain in my chest. It feels more like a bruise or soreness feeling but its internally. My chest x-ray from when I was sent to the hospital a few days ago came back clean.\n\nNo current medication.\nTL;DR:"}

Since then I decided to stop wasting money on them and it's been a few months since I had sex with one.\n\nTruth be told I had hoped the experience of losing my virginity would finally give me the confidence to actually be able to approach women sexually. I have tons of friends, go to parties all the time, but more often than not I just find I don't know how to initiate anything with a girl even if she's drunk and wild or something. You could say I almost feel like I am still a virgin in a ton of ways. I've never been on a date, never kissed a girl, never held a girl's hand or anything like that. At most I've danced with girls at parties.\n\nEven the thought of having sex again seems disgusting to me at this point. In my mind I can only associate it with the business-like model of simply handing money over to a hooker and then having sex with her. A lot of friends ask me why I never try to find a girlfriend or even do anything with girls at parties (let me say that I've had a lot of chances). Sex has become almost negatively reinforced in my mind from the bad experiences I've had with escorts. I can't even imagine what sex with just a normal consenting person is like.\nTL;DR:"}

B said she had feelings, also. B is now also talking to someone, not official, for a few weeks.\n\nOne night we got drunk and B kissed me. Nothing physical happened. We fell asleep on the couch and when we woke up around 3 am, B said she was feeling guilty about the kiss, because of the girl she's seeing. She told me not to worry, that she just needed some time.\n\nI texted B about a week later, as friends, to see if she wanted to hang out. No response. Texted her once more a week after, still no response. It's not been a month since B stopped talking to me. The movie we planed on seeing together came out today, I texted her asking if she'd still like to see it (2 weeks since my last text to her) and kindly asked her to just let me know, either way, instead of ignoring the text. No response.\n\nB and I have been friends for over a year, is this friendship seriously going to end because of one drunken kiss, when neither of us were in a relationship? I'm having a really hard time dealing with the fact that she'd be totally willing to drop our friendship, and I honestly have no idea what I did to warrant her complete dismissal of me. I still very much want her as a friend, and think she's a great person despite us kissing, but I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

It's a small rip and my mum taught me this when I was a kid. I also spent a lot time in India so I learnt to cook there. Maisie loves the food I make which is nice, but most people cook food so it shouldn't really be a big deal. \n\nThe problem is when she talks about this in front of friends, and their boyfriends especially. Last night Maisie was talking about how nice it was having someone who cooks 'such exotic food' and can sew.. her friend said she wishes her bf would do that while he was sitting right there. It was honestly just really embarrassing. I have social anxiety and I'm still fairly new around the group. A couple of guys glanced at me and I can tell they were thinking this guy is a douche. I like normal stuff like football and reading.. not being talked about in any way, especially for sewing and cooking. This is the third time something like this has happened. What do I say? I don't want to look like I'm ashamed of this stuff, or that I'm being rude. I overthink a lot but I'm not sure how to deal with this. \n\nThanks.\nTL;DR:"}

I come into contact with a lot of women and I'm comfortable with casual sex. I matched with a girl on Tinder. We went out and got along wonderfully. She was the sweetest, most guileless person I'd met in a long time, especially in a big city, but I wasn't deeply physically attracted to her. I felt like I should take her out again, though, because I liked so much about her. Well, we went out again and this time we wound up back at my place and slept together. We never communicated what our relationship was, what we were doing, what sex meant, etc. With any other woman I would say to myself, \"She just went home with me, I guess this is a casual thing for her.\" And I suppose that's what I was thinking in the moment.\n\nAs we parted ways this morning I suddenly felt a wave of self-loathing wash over me. I realized that I will never seriously pursue this woman. I simply am not physically attracted to her enough. She doesn't excite me in a primal way. \n\nAnd now I'm worried I've hurt someone who doesn't deserve it. There's an element of sheer confessional here, and it feels good to type out. This particular case is strange because, as I said, this is hardly my first rodeo, but something about this woman almost seems like a wounded bird. She particularly doesn't deserve this treatment. Is there any way to fix what I've done? Any women who have slept with a guy and then felt snubbed, what would you have wanted him to do to let you down easily?\nTL;DR:"}

We knew each other and became good friends over the course of a few years before dating, and continue to enjoy being with each other almost every day. \n\nWe used to have sex semi-frequently (maybe once or twice a week) a few months into dating. Frequency of sex quickly peaked, then sharply dropped off. We now attempt sex maybe once every few months, often ending a few minutes in. She generally seems disinterested or complains that penetrations hurts, but also turns down my advances to get her off in different ways too. She doesn't initiate physical intimacy or sex - just hugs, short kisses, etc. Attempts to rouse a more enthusiastic response are generally shot down. We have had great sex in the past, but recently a hit-or-miss sexual relationship has transitioned to miss-only. We've tried scheduling sex or looking forward to special days (birthdays, v-day, etc), but generally the moment overrules the plans.\n\nI don't suspect cheating from her - other aspects of our relationship are fantastic. We live together with one roommate, and both struggle on and off with depression issues but have both seen counselors for that for a long time. We have this place for another few months before we move out - then we get to figure out what's next.\n\nWe have discussed sex a lot, and I have let her know my needs. I'm often afraid that my libido is the problem, overactive. I just love her and want to share my love for her in a physical way.

We take him to the park daily at the same time, usually there are a bunch of regulars with the occasional once-in-awhilers.  All of the big dogs love him and want to play with him, but he just runs over and hides between my legs.  Sometimes he snaps at them when they get too intrusive, but he never bites.  Just barks.  \n\nThe best we have been able to do is get him to play tug-o-war with a yellow lab, and that's pretty rare.  He definitely loves a certain size of dog.

Saying I'm getting a package from Northern Tools. Package eventually came and I called them up to ask who made the order and it was all under my name. I wasn't charged because it wasn't my credit card and the email was different from the first instance.\nAfter that , I pulled my credit report and checked everything.  Put a lock on my credit and haven't been bothered since .\nAnyone heard of anything like this? We're they shipping stuff in my name to try and steal my identity? Neighbor trying to steal a package?  I'm at a loss to why they wouldn't use my credit card but only my information and sending the product to my house..\nTL;DR:"}

We didn't talk much or see each other after the first date.\n\nShe recently hit me up looking for weed (dont judge :P ) and I THOUGHT she was dating this guy because last time I saw her FB profile she was with him (probably a week before or so) but then I checked before I left and it said she was single. We talked for a while and I ended up suggesting stuff to do for her birthday this weekend and she said she didnt have many people to go out with for it so we kinda made plans to. \n\nMy other friend's birthday is the same day and because he's a real close friend I had to cancel on her.\n\nAnyways, thats where I'm at now. Feel bad for cancelling on her, but I kind of had to. I want to see her again soon but because I only just saw her the other night and that her bday is coming up, and because of our past I feel weird hitting her up.

She began to cry and think that I found her unattractive. I told her I was just really nervous and she forgave me.\n\nWe spent the next few times we were intimate having oral sex (I was avoiding penetration due to the fear of going soft). She noticed and I came clean to her that I was still nervous about performing and that I was afraid it was affecting my ability to have an erection. We went through the same cycle where she told me \"I don't get how you can be nervous about this. Just focus on how good it's going to be\". Easier said than done.\n\nAfter me pleading for another 2 days, we sort of made up and tried again after I had time to cool my head. I was putting on the condom and this time I came prematurely.

My boyfriend (23) and I have been together roughly about nine months, and it got serious around 5 months. We both had trust issues from previous relationships, and emotional walls that we weren't ready to let down for each other in the first few months. Long story short, right when we finally got to the point where the walls were coming down, he had to move about six hours away for work. Ever since then, we've been on and off, and fighting quite a bit. I recently had a huge realization that I am very much in love with him, though, and that I am finally ready to put all my walls down for him.\n\nI had a conversation with him about this, and opened up and told him that I was actually seeing the relationship going somewhere, and he felt the same. Things were great for a while after that until our next fight. It's like the better the relationships get, the worse the fights get with it. This last one he admitted to me that he has a lot of doubt towards us...that broke my heart. I feel like a fool for being so happy and giddy while he's over here doubting the whole thing. \n\nHe smokes pot regularly because of his back pain, and I'm in nursing school. He doesn't see a nurse marrying a pothead. I agree to a certain extent...but then he turns around and says he wishes I would love him for who he is, flaws and all. It's not even a big deal to me, though. I used to smoke, and I really don't care as long as it's not around me. \n\nI'm just confused. I'm finally at a point where I want to start thinking about a potential future, and now he's doubting it. I feel stupid, I guess. Is all of this worth working through? I feel like it is, and it would give us a really strong foundation if we can work through everything. Or am I just playing a fantasy in my head and holding on by a thread?\nTL;DR:"}

When Im with someone I care about, I like to go out of my way to do special and unique things to let them know how much I care. I thought I finally found someone who was the same way. My current boyfriend has been kind and affectionate and thoughtful and he made me feel special. It was everything I always wanted in a relationship. \n\nThe problem is, he's not just the perfect boyfriend to me, he's the perfect boyfriend to all of his female friends (there are currently four who he speaks with daily).  I first found this out last valentines day when he showed up late to our date because he'd been delivering flowers and chocolate to those four friends. I wasn't super happy to find out he'd asked them all to be his valentine since they were all sad and single.  The friendships are platonic and have been around longer than Ive known him but it irked me that I was sharing my boyfriend with all these other girls.  We talked about it and he explained that thats just how he's always been with his friends and I shouldn't be upset since he was just giving them flowers and chocolate while we had the entire night to be together. \n\nRecently Ive noticed my boyfriend has been using pet names with his friends more often and letting them know he loves them. This made me really mad. Its one thing to share the kind gestures on special occasions but if he's calling them Honey and Sweetie and telling them I love you on a regular basis, I feel like Im being cheated on. \n\nI asked my boyfriend to stop calling the girls by pet names and telling them he loves them so often but when I did, he got angry with me. He accused me of trying to distance him from his friends.  Im not asking him to stop seeing them or talking to them, I just want to have something reserved for just me.

As i was about to speak another lady comes up behind me and says \"i have a group of three and i have one senior\" again the hostess replies \"ok not a problem that will be about 25 min\" now it pissed me off that both women cut in front of me but it also pissed me off that the hostess clearly saw me walk up and wait for her but never acknowledged me.

Might break up?\nPOST: So me and my gf go back to when we were both in High School, and Civil Air Patrol cadets. We both went to a summer training event in 2007 and talked on and off for years. Then I started going to college in Long Island (where she is from) we start talking again after she transfered to another school on the island. We met up the first week in January and starting daiting two weeks after. Im a AFROTC cadet, and so was she in till she transfered back, did a semester of AROTC on the Island, and Joined the Frat Pershing Rifles. I told her before we started daiting that I wanted her to be open to me, and that she could tell me about anything. Recently after about 5 1/2 months of dating she feels like we are not right for each other. I ask into it, and she tells me about these issues she had with me after the fact of her making up her mind that she doesnt want to be with me. I dont know what to do, and am trying everything to convince her these problems can be fixed, and that I do trust her. I supported her when she was pledging the frat, and after she was in we had an issue with another cadet that was trying to get with her while knowing she was with me. We fixed it and he stopped bothering her, but after that she feels like she cant talk to me about her guy friends with me getting upset or jealous. I dont mind her guy friends, and they all seem pretty chill/nerdy. I just wish she had been fully open with me about her problems, and will talk to me about it. I leave for an Air Force training program for a couple weeks tomorrow, and is stressing me out. I will be able to talk to her on and off, but at this point Im not sure what else to say.

I found my current job by emailing the head office of the restaurant chain itself, instead of applying direct like my coworkers did but this method doesn't seem to be working this time around, I think I got lucky.\n\nMy town is full of rich families who own at least 2-3 restaurants/cafes/retail stores each. All these rich families are friends and its their children and their children's friends that end up working in the businesses. I know this because the owners of my workplace also own other places in the area, and the people I work with knew the owners personally before they got the job. I've tried handing in multiple resumes to every shop/business in my town, and if they don't take resumes I email or apply online. I've taken advice from this subreddit by carefully researching each place and spending a lot of time on the cover letter so that it's personalised to each place and am yet to even get a call back let alone an interview. \n\nI'm aiming to not work in fast food, if that's the only place I can get a job I'm better off just sticking where I am. I had a job at a department store before my own currently and I'd be lucky to get a shift every 2 weeks, so I probably wouldn't consider that either.\nTL;DR:"}

I am the type of person that doesn't think much of a lot of things (such as petty issues as \"he said, she said\", or the like).  She is moody a lot, and tends to take her rage out on me, but I still take it and try to calm her down most of the time.\n\nNow, normally, I would be at her house an average of 2-3 times per week. She lives about an hour away from me, so the driving definitely brings up the gas bill quite a bit for me.\n\nShe had previously asked me if I was going to come over for Thanksgiving, and I hadn't planned on doing so because we both have large families that we need to \"hang out\" with, so I told her that I wasn't planning on it, and she became very distraught. She asked me again a few days later, and I said I **MAY** come over if I leave my own family in time.\n\nSo here we are on Thanksgiving, and my own festivities hadn't started until about 5:30. I was expecting to eat at 4, but that didn't happen. So a few hours later, I end up telling her that there is no way that I could make whatever was happening over there. I hadn't left my family's event until about 9PM, which would put me out there around 10. \n\nAfterwards, she has been ignoring me ever since. A few texts here and there telling me that she is very angry and blah blah blah. \n\nThis morning, she started blowing up at me telling me that she doesn't want to be with me for Christmas or any of the holidays, and it all seems rather childish to me. She is claiming that I \"didn't care\" to come over.\n\nI am honestly at my wits end here.

Earlier this semester, I was out with some friends at our local gay bar for the drag show, and I saw that this guy was there, and he was one of those guys who I had always thought was decently cute, but I never talked to. Anyway, he was there with some mutual friends, and we talked a little bit, and then ended up dancing together. One thing led to another, and I tried to kiss his face, and he freaked out and ran off. It was kinda disappointing, but you win some, you lose some. :P\n\nAnyway, I found out that he had just very recently come out, and so that was probably why he freaked. And I felt bad because I scared him, and kinda felt like a gay mother hen because he was new to the whole scene. So there was a gaymer meetup in our city this past weekend (where a whole bunch of gays and friends get together and play board and video games. They're a lot of fun) and I thought that he might want to come and meet people and such. I don't see him that often, and so one day I was in the campus Starbucks, and on my way out, I saw him sitting with a few people, and asked him if he wanted to come. He said no, and I accepted that he probably felt awkward about what happened, and just left.\n\nAs I found out today, a week or more after this happened, I accidentally outed him to the friends he was sitting with. Apparently he was not 100% out, and I just told his friends, and maybe he wasn't ready or something?

Myself, and 2 guys I am close with are friends with another guy (lets call him T), however since the first few weeks his behaviour has started to change and in his drunk state he is creepy towards girls, says things without thinking that are rude and doesn't seem to have much self control.  \nFor example, we were walking home after a night out and with every girls we passed he would cat-call them saying \"Oi Oiii\" and me my the two other guys on our floor both could tell the girls were very uncomfortable, we told him to stop but he just doesn't. We then stopped for some late night food, in here he couldn't keep his mouth shut to a few people in there and almost got us into a fight after calling a girl a 'ginger slut'. When we got home after diffusing the situation while he sat behind us we sat him down in the kitchen and told him he needs to sort out the way he talks to people when drunk, if it threatens our safety we wouldn't help him next time. After all this he says \"Okay.. but she was a ginger slut\", I had had enough at this point so I went to bed.  \nThere have been a few other instances of him calling our female friends ugly, being creepy to other friends and making others uncomfortable.  \nThe issue is that we want to get a house for next year for 6 people which means we have to start looking in the next few weeks, but we don't want to live with him because he shows no signs of changing, despite us having a few talks with him about his behaviour. What should we do? Tell him we don't want to live with him and potentially make things awkward for the rest of this year, considering he doesn't have another good group of friends. Or look into it ourselves and don't tell him until we have signed the lease for a house? Any advice would help, thank you!\nTL;DR:"}

We have been dating for a while, and this is the most serious relationship I've been in, we really like each other.  We both agreed to take this relationship slowly.  I want to move forward sexually, but every time we take a step forward, my boyfriend seems really surprised that I want to go that far, and *quite* hesitant.  He also comes from a very religious family, so it's possible that sex before marriage is taboo in his household.  He is very, very, *very* naive about sexual things, to the point where he was embarrassed the first time he (accidentally) saw me without a shirt.  He got hard and was desperately trying to hide it from me.  Lol.\n\nAnyway.  I'm wondering whether you think, at this point, it is a good idea for me to move forward and ask him about developing our sex life?  I'm worried about making him uncomfortable.  I don't want to chase him away.  I'm experienced with sex, but I wouldn't say that I've had a normal virginity-losing experience, as I have been with some very pushy boys.  This relationship is a really healthy and good thing, and I don't want to mess it up.\n\nHere's the other side of the issue - I really want his experience losing his virginity to be a good one.  I don't feel like I had a good experience losing mine, and I don't want to push him, I want him to be healthily happy and ready.  But I also want to have sex!  How do I strike a balance?  How do I manage thisd?\n\nThanks for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

WTF?!?\nPOST: I posted once before about this [here](\n\nToday I found out they mark the beginning of their relationship FIVE DAYS after he broke up with me. That very night he said I could come sleep over; he kissed me goodbye after lunch three days later!\n\nI'm at a loss here. Did he ever really love me? He said he did, deeply, and the relationship was amazing for nine months. Taking care of me after surgery seemed to be more than he could handle though. Was he already moving on to her a month before we broke up? I know they hung out without me at least once in that time frame. I also found out that he dated the girl I knew only as his roommate for nearly two years and then broke up with her out of the blue; neither of them ever gave me any hint of any of that, and she still lives with him.\n\nOver the last month, since my \"friend\" confirmed their relationship, he has changed his phone number, blocked me from both his and her Facebook pages, blocked me from every email address I know of his, and is generally acting like I'm stalking him around town on an hourly basis; I know all this because I was trying to get back some things I forgot he had. \n\nHe once told me he had to move home from a different state after he found his then girlfriend and his best friend in bed together and they began threatening his life; why the hell would THEY threaten HIS life? He also told me he no longer speaks to his family because of some overreaction on their part to a simple, honest request of his. I'm beginning to question his side of both stories. WTF is wrong with him? Does he have some distorted way of looking at the world, like extreme paranoia? He's socially anxious with ADHD, but those are the only \"issues\" I knew of. Is he a sociopath or a narcissist or just extremely self-centered?\n\nUltimately, I think I found a whole nest of crazy and am thankful I found out sooner rather than later. I cannot wait for them to destroy each other, and I'll never take either of them back.\nTL;DR:"}

It very open with the talking about that stuff. \n\nI have this problem, since the start of seeing each other after I've seen her that maybe she has changed her mind and isn't that into me. \n\nLike she plays little hard to get at times, but I think it's more in a cheeky playful way, as in her nature to do it. \n\nBut it leaves me with a bad feeling every time I leave her as I think has she changed her mind. For example we spent the last 2 nights together, had a great time I think. Last night she was in a bit of a strange mood, we didn't have sex, but were pretty tired. Then this morning we had sex and she was more affectionate etc. said she was in a bit of a strange mood because of something she saw on Facebook. She wouldn't tell me what, I asked if it was something to do with an ex, she said no but still wouldn't tell me what it was. Things like that make me question things a lot, like if it really ain't an ex why wouldn't she tell me. I didn't push it though and left it \n\nNevertheless, I am very insecure about this sort of stuff and don't know how to handle it. I just feel like I don't have her unfortunately, not like a piece of property to own, but you know what I mean. It's getting to me.\nTL;DR:"}

I had a gf back then and she wanted to try the long distance relationship. At my 19th birthday a friend of mine sent me a picture of her kissing another friend of mine in a club. I was with her for ~ 2 years and it broke my heart. I broke up with her and i did not think about girls until now. \n\nNow to my current situation: I'm in another country for a few weeks to study with a few friends and I met the perfect girl. She is smart, funny, looks good and the time i spend with her is great. We were out together a few times (with her and my friends, not alone) and it was great. The two of us also spent one night together just talking in her room. I loved it. \n\nThere are so many things she did that made me feel like i do right now . When i am with her, i even feel better than i did when I was with my exgf.\n\nShe is also hugging me all the time, lays her head on my shoulder etc.. Seems like she likes me, too, but im not sure. My friends always make fun of that and say that she likes me and that i should just f*** her, but thats not what i want, i guess i want more than just that. \n\nThere is just the problem that the time here is almost over, just 4 days left and i dont know if i should tell her how i feel. I mean, i cant concentrate on anything, since im thinking about her all the time and im a little depressed.\n\nI asked her to go out with me and she said yes, but said she is 'very busy studying, maybe tomorrow', so i hope for the best. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Should i tell her or just go home and try to forget her? :(\n\nOh, and the flight is only 1h, so it wouldnt be too much of trouble.\nTL;DR:"}

All's fine until I start to try out clothes to wear. I'm at ~170 pounds and have lost recently around 40 pounds. This is good and all but I still have major insecurities with my body. No matter what I tried, I looked myself in the mirror and got digusted by my own look. I'm working my ass off in the gym but my \"love handles\" don't go away.\n\nAnyway, I get frustrated and slightly depressed. To the point where I even cried. Don't want to call it depression though. So, I know myself and being realistic knew that I wouldn't be going out because of my insecurities and because I was feeling really low. My gf at first was comprehensive but then turned and started to hurling accusations at me. \"I can never do anything with you\", \"your selfish\" etc. \n\nI felt like a cornered cat, she kept on escalating to the point where I burst. I tried to contain myself but I couldn't. This girl gets psycho and doesn't stop till things go to the extreme. She wouldn't stop and I resisted with all my might to punch her straight in the face. I did have to restrain her by putting her in a headlock. And before it got any further I left the house.\n\nWho is in the wrong? Is it me for having these insecurities or is it her for not understanding me and my issues?

The idea is that after a guy has been married to his wife for seven years, he starts to feel the itch to look elsewhere outside of marriage.  Embarrassingly enough, I think this is happening to me.\n\nI really have no urge to actually cheat on my wife, but I can't help myself from really taking a lot more notice of other women these days.  Recently while we were on trips to the beach and a music festival, I would go walking around while she was doing something else and hide my ring hand in my pocket and shoot a few smiles to other women.  I don't think I'd ever act on anything, but the adrenaline rush of at least making that kind of connection is something that I hadn't felt since before I was married, and I honestly have to confess that I've missed it.\n\nBut here's the thing, I don't want to cheat on my wife.  She's really hot, is wonderful to me, and I really have no need whatsoever to look elsewhere.  We have sex a little less often than I'd prefer, but I understand that we don't have to be 100% into the same things in that area, and that she's often tired from work or not into it at the same time that I am.\n\nSo what do I do?

Sometimes its just her and I, and other times its as a group. I have not kissed her, or attempted to for that matter. However, I do continue to make contact (Hug, touch her arm, her hair, lean into her ect). She is totally ok with this. She likes the compliments as well. She also reciprocates with things like your a great guy, and touching my bicep and hands and whatnot.\n\nShe also asks questions like would you rather have great casual sex, or a solid relationship with decent sex?\n\nFurthermore she trusts me enough to get drunk in front of me. I actually carried her to bed one night (would have kissed her but that would kinda be a dick move as she was drunk and I was not). She also shares some very personal things with me. I will not repeat them here as I do not want to breach that trust. She is feeling somewhat overwhelmed by school this semester.\n\nI really want to try and kiss her or ask her out. Im willing to wait until after the semester is over (3 weeks). Would telling her she is looking very pretty and saying I want to kiss her be creepy?

She is constantly writing on his wall, private messaging and has mentioned texting/calling but I don't know how frequent this is. A few weeks ago my boyfriend and I had an argument about this, and he basically tells me he doesn't agree with whatever I'm saying about him getting close with that girl.\n\nThe very next day, I open facebook to see that he has written lyrics of a song on her wall.

I ask him how come she's inviting him to her birthday if they are \"not close\". (Keep in mind, they have never met. They only started talking due to that radio show.) Basically the question gets dodged, \"It's not like I'm going to meet her anyway\" etc.\n\nYesterday, I went to his wall to post something when the very first post I see is from that girl, telling him she's so sad he couldn't make it and so on. He responds by saying he's sorry too but he'll let her know when he's back in town so they can arrange a meet up.\n\nThis is so infuriating and I honestly can't stop crying. It's like nothing makes a difference to him? Me crying means jack, me being upset means nothing. He then tells me he was just being polite, and he wasn't going to meet her anyway. WTF?

We moved in together this semester, and have a few other roommates.  \n\nWhen I met my boyfriend, he was 5'9, 120 pounds.  A beanpole, extremely skinny looking.  Over the next 2.5 years he put on about 30 pounds eating unhealthy dining hall food.  Not the best way to gain weight, but he looked a lot better afterwards, much more healthy looking.  We were the same weight at this point (yes, I'm overweight.  I'm working on it, I'm on a 1200 calorie diet, and I'm trying not to let my fatness cloud judgement here).  \n\nNow that we live off campus, we don't eat at the dining hall anymore.  I do the cooking.  I cook pretty healthy food, mostly vegetarian because of cost/preference.  He loves my food and eats whatever I make.  But he's lost so much weight, it's very visible.  In the last four months he's lost at least 10-15 pounds.  I give him much larger portions than I eat, bring him regular meals and all that stuff, but he just keeps getting skinnier.  \n\nIt's not that I'm less attracted to him, I just feel like a bad girlfriend because I can't keep him well-fed.  I show my love through food.  I'm a very demonstrative, touchy person and he is less so, but food is a demonstration I give that never gets turned down.  So I pride myself on being a good cook.  \n\nHow do I get over this?  There are some things that still lead to friction between us, like the fact that he doesn't eat breakfast, or that before a big exam or project he won't eat at all because it makes him nervous.  I know I should just let him live his own life, but I really want to pamper and mother him with food and it worries me that he keeps losing weight.\nTL;DR:"}

I can be pretty forward, but didn't know how far she wanted to taking things, and didn't want to put her in an awkward position in front of her friends, so I let her set the pace. She guided my hands across her body several times, and we probably spent the last 45 minutes of the evening making out until last call.\n\nOur friends all went their separate ways. I considered inviting her back to my place, but I don't typically like to jump right into bed with someone, so we said good night and each got into our respective taxis.\n\nI think she's a great person and I enjoyed the evening, though I've never sensed any chemistry between us until last night, so I'm not sure if this was her way of telling me she's interested, or she just wanted to fool around with a new guy on the dance floor and felt she could trust me. I've heard she just got out of a relationship in the last few weeks. We both had maybe two cocktails a piece, so enough for a mild buzz, but not enough that it would have impaired either of our judgment. \n\nMy gut says that since I hadn't felt any chemistry in the past, and especially because we have a lot of mutual friends (and they're a gossipy bunch), it would be safer to just remain friends, rather than date and have it go poorly. She could very well feel the same. I'm not sure how to discern whether she's interested without asking her out on a date. \n\nWhat say you, Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

Though I'm the first guy she's consistently had orgasms with, not once has she squirted in the hundreds of times we've had sex. It's not too uncommon for her to feel like she has to pee (supposed to be a clue that she has to squirt) in certain positions, but she's never actually done it with me. The other day I gave her a nice massage and fingered her with the \"come hither\" motion, yet it still didn't work (though she said she felt very close).\n\nI realize that this is a non-issue from a rational standpoint, and it's something that she couldn't care less about. Still, I can't help but feel inadequate when I compare myself to some guy that she wasn't even dating and didn't have serious feelings for that made her squirt with his dick when he wasn't even trying.

He just called asking if they can 'borrow' some of the articles, and I explained the above predicament- that I like the magazine and where it's going, but cannot afford to do an internship for free at this point in my life.\nThere was a group 'brainstorming' session yesterday, and they really liked my ideas and leadership, and thus I said that I'd like to be offered a position- either staffed or freelance (my mistake, should have just said staffed)- with the magazine immediately, as they had already seen the wealth I could contribute.\nHe seemed open to this idea, and asked how much an article would cost. \nNow, me having never done any paid writing before, I really had no idea what sort of number to give him, so I said I'd have to figure out the numbers, and would talk to him at a team mixer tonight.\nTL;DR:"}

Off the bat I told them I was unsure of being serious and they were on the same page. I figured it would be a casual thing, maybe 3 dates tops, but we ended up clicking really well. I met their family shortly after dating, which they made of point of emphasizing was a big deal to them. I figured that was their non-verbal way of saying, \"I'm taking this seriously, I take you seriously and want to see where this goes.\"\n\nI knew from date one that they were not big on texting, and we agreed seeing a SO daily was not only inconvenient but kind of annoying. Their lack of contact via text between our meetings used to not be a big deal to me, but we had a weird almost-fall-out and since I asked them to show me they care and to make a point of making me feel important in their life. \n\nI realize work and life-enveloping hobbies are a big deal, and they are more focused on those right now. But to me taking five seconds to poke me and say \"Hi beautiful\", or even a nude pic ffs, would be appreciated. \n\nRather than give them an ultimatum to change, I told them I felt I wanted more and that it would be unfair of me to ask for it. They said to stay in touch insinuating they would be around if I changed my mind. By the end of our meeting I had already regret my decision (I think that's normal when one is on the fence and have an amazing person in front of them.)\n\nI'm simply wondering if dealing with the contact-distance is something i can handle if I do choose to involve again. There are some days where I'm fine with it, and others where I'm biting my nails wishing they would respond to my text (i never send a second if there's no response to the first.)\n\nAdvice on my choice would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

We hardly drank and I took her home and we started talking about our relationship, and that she sort of likes me. I thought about us doing stuff together and turns out she's into just making out and having fun so I didn't mind and we started making out in the back seat after parking the car practically in the middle of nowhere. After a while of sweet smoochin', she suddenly broke off and said she's feeling dizzy. 'Damn right you feel dizzy...' I thought to myself smugly and saw her exit the car for fresh air, saying she feels a little nauseated. Without having the time to understand what's going on she went around behind a tree and puked her freakin' lungs out. And I was just sitting there, watching her puke as she kept going with another splat of creamy, gooey vomit with chunks of ex-food and stuff. I asked if she's ok and she said she needed some water, so I, stupidly, said \"ok, sure, wait here\" and drove off to find a place open at 2AM that sells water, leaving her alone in the middle of God knows where and returned only about 15-20 minutes later with some water and a small pack of tissues. She cleaned up and when I took her home she didn't say a word for the whole ride, even when she got off the car and left. \nHaven't heard from her since.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been working out for about 3 years now (at least, that's how long I've been a member of my gym).  But just within this past year, I've noticed that after a hard workout, I start to experience flu-like symptoms the next day.  I ache all over, there's shivering, and sometimes diarrhea.  These symptoms last the entire next day and sometimes into the day after.\n\nBefore, I have never considered connecting the two (working out, flu-like symptoms).  I had always assumed I just had the flu.  I looked it up online, found this question in a surprising amount of forums and each time it's been dismissed as \"Oh, you have the flu.  Did you go to bed with your hair wet?  Did you wipe down the machine before you used it?  Maybe you caught it from someone at the gym?\" **But I don't think it's that simple.**  \n\nThe first time it happened to me was last summer, I swam for the first time that summer for about an hour, and as hard as I could.  The next day I thought the chlorine made me sick.  Then it happened a month later after I went running outside and pushed myself to go farther than I usually go.  After that it happened a few more times, especially when I started a new exercise, but it was winter and I assumed that I was getting sick all the time.  And then it happened yesterday after I did intervals on the treadmill (I pushed myself hard), and it's finally clicked in my brain to connect these two things together.  \n\nI am a 30 year old female, pretty healthy overall, active enough, and haven't had any major health issues in the past.

He was also not very \"nice\" to women and seemed to have a one-track mind if you know what I mean. But with me, he has always been very nice and respectful. We're good at solving problems and he values my opinion. We are two peas in a pod in terms of personality, ways of thinking, and interacting with each other.\n\nSo anyway, he claims to not watch porn, and I'm not sure if I believe it. It's not that he's ever given me a reason to think he's a real liar, of course there were a couple little white lies but that's honestly it. This, combined with his history, what the internet has told me, and the fact that we are also long-distance... I don't know. I'm thinking that in-between visits maybe he watches it. It's just shoved down my throat in the media, reddit, etc that guys watch porn and lie about it. Sometimes we like to talk to each other about when we have self-sexy time (which he does a lot, which is another thing) and what we thought about, and he always has something prepared to say. He says that he thinks about when we do it in person and always remembers detailed events. But that could just be him preparing in advance for when I ask... I don't know.\n\nSo why is this an issue? It's not really. Porn isn't an issue to me. But I'm worried for the fact that he might be lying to me or that I'm not providing enough for him. Every couple months I'll bring it up and tell him that I'm fine with porn and he can watch it if he wants to, I'd just like to know. Regardless, he always says he doesn't.\nTL;DR:"}

Everything is fine and goes smoothly, our roommate is hardly ever home but he has expressed to us that he will most likely be moving out when our lease is up on the 1st of November to move back to his home state. \n\nNow for our dilemma - my boyfriend starts Fire Academy next month which will take up his weekends and being a bartender this means he will make less money BUT he is a Veteran so he will receive money from the GI Bill while he is attending Fire Academy. Our rent is bit high being as that we have a 2500 sq ft. house in Southern California and it will not be possible to move with him having no days off for the next 9 months and our dog is a rottweiler so almost all places discriminate against her breed.

However, in the past year or so we'e a passed a few major milestones together like moving to a new city together and buying a house together. Things are going pretty well. Since we've been through some relatively major milestones, we've talked about what would happen if we hit any major snags in our relationship or stopped getting along, and we both agree that we'd try to put effort in to make it work rather than break up. If things were bad enough for long enough we might separate, but both agree that we'd try stuff like therapy, etc before resorting to that. We've talked about marriage, and we'll likely get married eventually, but right now I'm working on my PhD so I don't have enough money (or time) to have a wedding for at least 4 years. \n\nNow, this is where I'm struggling to decide what to call our relationship to people when I meet them:\n\nIf I call her my \"Girlfriend\", it seems too casual and people look at us funny for having bought a house together. \n\nWe don't want to get engaged and call each other \"fiance\", as we won't be able to get married for several years and neither of us want to be that couple that's engaged for half a decade. \n\n\"Significant Other\" fits OK, but seems vague and overly formal.\n\n\"Life partner\" makes it sound like I'm gay (not that there's any problem with that, just don't want to give people the wrong idea)\n\nDoes reddit have any other advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm trying to be as patient as i can, and give him plenty of him-time (as he's so busy) but intimacy is crucial to me. He says i just have a high sex-drive and that he wants to keep it special and natural, but i'm feeling more and more dejected everytime he says he's not in the mood. I more often than not initiate sex, and this is also becoming tiring. When we have it it's great, it's just not very often. I'd be happy with twice a week, but he can easily go a week or more.

( i suspect he is body conscious, as we've never had sex during the day out of a bedroom in our 1 yr of being together.)\n\n- how do i discuss this with him without him thinking im making a big deal of it? ( he gets super defensive when i try to discuss it, which is a bit soul - tearing, due to having to muster up the courage to bring it up). \n\n- any tips or advice? Other than this relatively minor issue, we have a great relationship.\n\nThankyou :)\nTL;DR:"}

We will be playing, tickling each other, she'll playfully say stop as many do when you are being tickled, it escalates to roughhousing, and has in the past escalated to rough sex, which I find really excites her (she loves getting chased, etc, I imagine there might be some rape fantasies there I'm perfectly fine with but she might be too shy/uncomfortable with them herself) However, sometimes, in a moment of doubt, I'll stop because I wasn't sure if *that* time was a serious request to stop. Then, immediately from there, things go to the shitter. I'll stop, she'll get on a grumpy face, if I re-initiate she'll more strongly resist verbally and physically, so I stop, but then her pouting continues. She'll almost completely ignore me, won't talk to me, answers things in one word answers, etc. This can go on for hours. \"Are you mad at?\" \"No.\" that's all I get. I know she loves playing rough, but it seems like only *sometimes*.\n\nI want to know: What is this and what may be her motivation for doing this?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Has anyone had success in taking a crooked/unhelpful retailer to small claims court? Could use some advice.\nPOST: Hey, Reddit.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but here goes:\n\nA few weeks ago, I purchased a camera for my sister for her birthday (which was last week) from an online retailer that had received favorable reviews. I will mention that I this gift was from her boyfriend, who is from Europe and had no way of purchasing the camera himself and he sent me the cash via wire transfer.\n\nStupidly (I know, I know, I violated my own rule due to laziness), I made the purchase with my debit card since I didn't feel like using my credit card and moving money around, etc. I know, bad idea. I'm an idiot for doing so.\n\nAnyhow, I got an email from the company about three hours after placing my order saying that there might be some coupons associated with my purchase. Figuring on maybe getting expedited shipping for hearing a sales pitch, I gave them a ring and got the most aggressive sales pitch ever for memory cards, a bigger battery (WTF), etc. After saying no a million times, he said we were all set to go. The phone call left me with a rather uneasy feeling, so I thought about it for ten minutes, did some more digging, and found out they might not be the most reputable company (grey market goods, no U.S. warantees, some of the reports claimed). I called back shortly after to cancel my order and get a refund. I received two emails, the first stating my order was canceled, and the second stating the money would be returned in about 2-3 business days. My bank said to be aware it could take 7-10 business days. \n\nFlash forward a week, there's no sign of my money being returned. Customer service isn't helpful at all. I'm worried that they are either incompetent or totally crooked and am considering filing a suit in small claims court as I'm close enough to drive to the state in which they are located. \n\nSo, Reddit, I know we're not all lawyers, but what should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

She would take it in conjunction with drinking which apparently was a great way to get fucked up. It was something she said had been building up over years. She used to be a bigger drug user in her past but apparently this was her current drug of habit. She did have a prescription for it along with a script for Zoloft and some strong Ibuprofen. As far as I know that was it. I caught her after a particularly bad blackout night (I have since learned a bit about benzos) when I looked through her purse and put it together. Broke up with her.\n\nFast forward and we reconnected about 2 or 3 months ago. She says the pills are no longer a problem and I agree to try again. She makes a show of taking zzzquil to help her sleep on occasion which is fine with me. One night I had trouble sleep and went to grab one for myself from the box on her dresser and found some other pill. Looked it up and it turns out to be Temazepam. Took a look in her purse and found two forms of Adderall (Normal and XR?), Chantix, Ibuprofen and Lexapro. I have no idea what she does and does not have prescriptions for these days but I simply cannot imagine she has one for all of these.\n\nOne of my big issues was that she lied and hid her drug use from me the first go around and now here she is pretending to take an over the counter pill when in fact it is not. But maybe it is just because she is nervous about being honest me after the first go around.\n\nMy first reaction is to confront her and ask about what prescription pills she is currently taking and see what she has to say about it, see if she will come clean. Maybe ask her then and there to see where she keeps her prescriptions and then decide on what to do. Any advice on how to handle this?\nTL;DR:"}

She wants to spend as much time together as possible, sometimes 4-5 nights a week. This feels like *way* too much for me. I enjoy seeing her when I'm in a good mood, but I need time for myself and to recover from work, relax, and connect with friends.

The presentation goes well, and is very well received. Everyone thinks its a great idea to link our products up to apps instead of controlling them via switches and push buttons. The final slide of my project was titled \"Why Android Initially\", this is where things went, very, very bad. I presented data showing that Android based devices currently hold >50% market share and Apple is only around 38%. I then proceeded to tell everyone 82% of new phones being shipped right now are Android based. I also explained that development for Android was much easier than iOS. After I finish making these points my CEO just responds with \"Well, 82% of people are stupid\". Obviously thinking it was a joke, and he just liked Apple more, I responded back with \"Looks like we have a fanboy in the room\". The room went dead silent for the remainder of my presentation.

I've dated a bit since, but nothing has really sparked...\n\n..Until three weeks ago, when I was out with an old friend (10+ years).  Because we had both been in serious relationships for years of our friendship, we never really had put each other in the \"dateable\" category.  But now that we're both single (and have been for awhile), something changed between us and suddenly \"hanging out\" turned into a date...and a good one at that.\n\nWe've been seeing each other pretty regularly since then, and things have escalated physically and, at least, for me, emotionally.  I don't fall easily for people.  But for him, I've fallen hard and fast.\n\nTonight, I need to know a bit more about where we stand.  I hate being the stereotypical clingy girl and asking about emotions, etc.  But for the sake of my sanity, I need to know if he feels the same way or if I should stop hoping that this amorphous thing might be something less wibbly-wobbly.

I got on the superman ride  location. I had my cellphone in my pocket. Went through a sweet loop and felt something slip out of my shorts. Turns out it was my iPhone. Asked the employees what I could do. They said to file a lost/found report. \n\nAs I was getting off the, a couple friends and I saw where the phone had landed. It was inside of a danger zone which only Six Flags employees could access. We asked an employee who was around that area and he said he usually does the rounds at all the rides picking up items from danger zones. His name was Mike.\n\nI went to file my report and gave as much information as I could. At this point, i used my wife's iPhone and logged into the \"Find my iPhone app\" and it showed up here:  I showed them this image and they immediately knew the phone was in a danger zone and that no one would be able to access it until the next day when the park closes.\n\nI went home thinking I would be fine because it would be returned to me because it was in a safe \"Danger Zone\". WRONG.\n\nI checked the Find my iPhone app early Sunday morning just to see if they had grabbed it. To my dismay, it showed up here: \n\nI was shocked. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was only 1 explanation. An employee from Six flags, that has access these areas, stole the phone. I immediately called the Lost & Found office and told them that I had image proof that the phone was taken from a Danger Zone. They said they couldn't help me and that their employees wouldn't steal items.\n\nAt this point, I'm really pissed and don't know what to do. I tried contacting NJ Police but they didn't sound too happy about allocating resources into finding my phone.\nTL;DR:"}

The idea of a hired cat-sitter company to come over was also shot down.\n\nThe roommate cites renters insurance not covering a friend doing something to the apartment. The roommate is fine with maintenance coming into the apartment and she doesn't even know those people!\n\nIs it so out of line to ask a friend to come into the house to take care of the cat if the roommate doesn't want to do it?

My mom had left to get lunch and she told me and my brother to empty the dish washer before she gets back with the typical parent \"or else\"comment.  So as so as she left I decided to empty the dishwasher, and I emptied about 3/4 of it.  I bent down to pick up a glass bowl, and then I pull up to put in in the cabinent. Much to my suprise did I realize that the bowl made contact with the edge of the counter, and a few shards fell.  One of them fell in my foot.  Well dumb old me pulled it out, and this is then when I learned that the foot has Arteries (or some big vein).  Whatever vein it was, I knew it was important because the blood was coming out in bursts.  Now I do not deal well with blood, and infact that year I passed out in health when my teacher was talking about IVs.  So my brother finally comes down after hearing my screaming, and he calls 911.  My mom comes home pretty soon, and well both of them walked into a murder scene.  Our white tile floor looked like someone threw a blood orgy and to prove how bad it was, I can still see a small red tint in the tile today.  An interesting thing is we have a Bichon(white fluffy dog).  Well the dog decides to fucking roll around in to blood and lick it all up.

We were sort of casual/friends with benefits, but about a week ago we were hanging out and I got really drunk and started crying because I thought he was sleeping with someone else and I felt stupid because I liked him so much and didn't feel like he reciprocated.\n\nAnyway, the next day he said he didn't want to hurt my feelings, but thought that we shouldn't continue our relationship because we wanted different things, though he wanted to be friends. I felt it was kind of inevitable after my meltdown. I genuinely want to stay friends too. We have a great connection, with or without the romantic aspects, and it would really hurt me to lose that. I also don't want it to be awkward or forced.\n\nI've just been having a rough week, keep texting him a lot - initially stuff about my feelings and how sorry I was, questions about if he was seeing anyone else, was there something wrong with me, then just general attempts at conversation. I cry at random times, I've barely left my bed, I've hardly ate. I sleep okay and sometimes I dream about other stuff, but the minute I wake up I'm sad again. I literally cannot stop thinking about him. Everything reminds me of him. I keep reading old messages and wondering where I went wrong, because he was so into me at first. It's making me crazy. How do I focus my thoughts on something else??\n\nI'm going to try to see a therapist (for this and other depression/anxiety issues), but in the meantime, I can't keep going on with life feeling crazy and on edge. I feel like my breakups have never really been this bad before, and I have no idea why I feel so torn up over it when he wasn't even my boyfriend to begin with.

During my 'mourning period', I met and began messing around with this girl (whom we'll refer to as Jane). Jane was going through a rough patch with her boyfriend of over a year (I'm THAT fucking guy, I guess) so we began having sex to...balance the playing field, I suppose you could say. \n\n**Now on to the fuck up:** Jane came over today to 'watch a movie' in my dorm room, which had become the lingo among our friends to say we were gonna have sex, and sure enough, we did. What you must understand is that my bed is a bunk bed, lifted ~5.5ft off the ground. She had trouble finding a way to get down, so I told her to jump in my arms. As she did, I caught her, but stumbled and dropped her on the hard-as-fuck tile floor, on her already-broken and/or sprained wrist. She essentially told me we were done, and I'm now left with good ol' leftie.\nTL;DR:"}

I haven't really met my neighbors but one of them has a really nice cat they let out that frequently comes up for pets and he/she has a collar. Another one of my neighbors I met recently and I could tell when she was getting out of her car, her dog was not well behaved and was tugging and pulling himself, almost choking himself to break free and was barking the whole time. I arrived to the same area of where our apartments are located and this dog is barking mad and growling at me and trying his hardest nearly choking himself to break free so I avoid him. I see the friendly cat walk past so I pet the cat. My neighbor tries to tell me that her dog is friendly and nice but he is a rescue. In order to get to my apartment I have to walk near her and her dog and so I carefully walked towards the door when she gave the leash some slack, and the dog was able to get close enough to me and sniffed me and then lunged forward and tried to bite me. Luckily my purse was in the way so he got a mouthful of my bag instead of me. He bit my bag and tugged hard but could not hang on. She then tried to play it off and said I guess he's not that nice, oh well he's nice to kids though. She asked me if I was okay and I was cause the dog only bit my bag but I can't imagine this behavior is ok. Is there anything I can do about it other than avoid her and her dog? Her dog was on a leash but due to the proximity of her being near the entrances of the area of our apartments, I was close enough to get attacked by her dog.

I'm just a 24 year old trying to make it on my own. Last year, I was working for state parks making ADA (Americans with disabilities act) standard hiking trails. I got injured on the job, broke my foot. I was injured last fall. This wasn't figured out until March and I got surgery yesterday. Yesterday made me rethink my life as a whole. My brother was supposed to be at my house by 8 to drive my car to the hospital. The most accurate description I can give is if you gave Homer Simpson a functional meth habit. Naturally, he shows up an hour and a half late. I am livid considering he's an hour late, in possession of my car. Shows up with the girl he's cheating on his girlfriend with. My brother drops me off and just leaves, in my car, and with hours before I'm out of surgery. He's still my brother and it really hurt to know it didn't remotely occur to him to stay by my side and keep me company. I also told my girlfriend the date of my surgery. She didn't even try to get the day off, she went home after work, and when I finally got out and called her the first thing she says is \"what happened?\" Not \"how did it go?\", \"are you okay?\", or even a simple \"how are you feeling?\". Back to before my surgery, the RN ends up popping three of my veins and bending their needles in my hands. I ask for a new nurse and he gets it right away. Surgery went fine, so I call my brother to come get me. The hospital doesn't have crutches in my height. He informs me that he cracked my radiator despite the fact that there was still coolant. I'm on disability until I'm healed up and I can't afford more than rent and food. So now I'm in a cast, broke, with no transportation to get my pain meds even if I have the money. My entire next check is going to rent. I don't have money for groceries for the next two weeks and I can't even be resourceful and pick local fruit trees. I'm sick of living here, it's ghetto as shit. I'm not thriving and I'm not being appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

This is not an exaggeration. She is ignorant and lacks critical thinking skills. For example, last year, she went through a phase where she absolutely wouldn't eat pork. She thought it was inferior in nutrition to beef because that's \"what the people on tv said.\" When I asked her to explain she just repeats herself and can't go into detail. As for the ignorant part, she once saw a black man in a suit at the supermarket and remarked, \"I thought black people were poor.\" I'm pretty sure that comment came from her being uneducated as opposed to intentionally malicious as he may have been the first black person she's ever seen since she lives in a medium sized city in Korea. \n\nMIL grew up in poverty in the aftermath of the Korean War, and on top of that, her parents didn't think it was important to educate their daughters, so I don't hold these things against her.

My recent experiences show that I have a tendency to get friendzoned before anything happens.\n\nWell, my sister had the idea to set me up with a girl my age that is in her performance group. I agree and get a name, do some facebook stalking so I know who to look out for, and a few days later I go to a performance. Then after the performance I go to where they're cleaning up and my sister introduces her to our mom and myself. I couldn't think of anything I could do or say in the situation with the overbearing-ness that was my sister and mom standing right there. So I introduced myself and that's about it. I am sure I came across as shy. We made eye contact for only a couple seconds.\n\nI'm definitely interested and don't want to mess it up.\n\nSo basically at this point I don't know any of her contact info and we're not friends on facebook. I'm looking for tips on how to proceed. I found the [how to flirt guide] this morning, is there anything similar I could reference? Should I let my sister continue to set us up or should I step in? When should I take the reins?\n\nLTR Explanation: For the last 6-7 years I suppose you could say I took the \"easy way out\" and simply started a relationship with an old girlfriend from high school or something. From what I remember, very little was needed in the way of flirting or building attraction, as I already knew them fairly well before we started dating.\nTL;DR:"}

It's been a week of me giving her space and pretty much no contact besides her responding to a text every couple days or so.  I'm not sure how long I should give her before I break up with her.  I'm guessing one week of this isn't long enough end a 15 month relationship, but I'm not exactly sure where to draw the line going forward.  I have a feeling I will get some responses along the lines of \"There's no right answer, it's entirely up to you\" but I'm kind of curious how long you guys would wait before calling it off, just so I can have some perspective.

The night was going good until I found a girl there was someone who my SO hates from their high school days. I don't have anything against her so acted friendly. She started getting very physical with cuddling up to me on couches and massaging me whenever she had the chance, harmless. I still tried to keep my distance until I had consumed a bit too much alcohol and returned arms around her for a short time. People then suddenly started going to bed and we ended up on one couch for a little while. I didn't kiss the girl But she, or we, got a bit handsy and did a low amount of down pants. I then went to sleep and she wasn't there when I woke up. I  got her number off the friend I went with and told her I was sorry and so on. She replied things like \"People do silly things when they're drunk\", \"Don't worry. It never happened\". Her and my SO have mutual friends so it could possibly get out that way. But i'm really unsure of whether I should tell my girlfriend as it's not fair to her. Or try to go about life as if it never happened. \n\nSome more reasons I might not want to tell my SO. She is quite emotional. On a few occasions in our 11 1/2months. she has physically harmed herself over silly things. E.g I didn't have sex with her for about 5 days and kept falling asleep at about 11pm. She deducted that I don't find her attractive anymore and cut her rib with a razor blade? Pretty scary to think what she will do now if we break up. I also love her.\nI KNOW I'm a bad guy. Scum of the earth. Don't deserve her love, attention or anything else. But I don't want to break up with her.\nTL;DR:"}

This week, I am moving to a different state, 8 hours away. It will be extremely difficult for me to see him, because with my work and school schedule, I won't have many opportunities to drive 16 hours for a weekend together, he cannot drive, and plane tickets are expensive. Besides that, after a difficult couple of years, I dream of being able to recreate myself and start a new life in a new state. I want to be able to go out and meet new people, and I don't want a long distance boyfriend (who really doesn't like me talking to guys, even as friends) holding me back. The problem is, I really love him, he's very kind and sweet to me, and I just feel so guilty that I want to break up with him for what are basically selfish reasons (not wanting long distance, wanting to go out and socialize with others, including guys). Am I making the right decision? If so, how can I break up with him and cause the least damage possible? And how can I deal with my guilt for not wanting to continue a good relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

We fell in love and agreed to date, even though we're a 2.5 hour drive away from each other. It worked well for a little while - we love all the same things, share the same political views, we're good at splitting the bill, call/text each other every day, and visit every other weekend. He made me happy with his carefree positive attitude and I helped motivate him to achieve more; it was a balance.\n\nNow it's 3 years later, and I am quickly realizing that I'm ready for my \"grown-up\" life to begin... I save money, jump on career opportunities, plan for the future, and I'm trying to get my own apartment. Unfortunately, despite being the sweetest guy ever, he has not really changed since I met him: his poor money habits scare the crap out of me, he doesn't plan anything out, and after changing his major *again* he still has 1 more year of school. He IS doing much better in school now, but his GPA from before was pretty low, and he still hasn't gotten an internship or joined a student group in order to make up for that (he \"tries\" but has never followed through).\n\nI've felt like a nagging mother lately, which is unhealthy, exhausting, and discouraging. I'm ready for an adult relationship, but he acts like a teenager when it comes to real-life scenarios. I love him so much, and his personality makes me happy... but it sucks having to carry ALL the adult burdens. On top of that, I wonder if giving up my weekends for him is causing me to neglect my own life (missing out on social things, not getting a dog like I wanted to, not joining groups/clubs, etc.).\n\nIs love enough, and I'm just being selfish? Or is it really time for me to call quits on this? :( Thanks...\nTL;DR:"}

Something that's really been bothering me is I don't think we've spent a saturday night together since this semester began (we're both 3rd year uni). I always ask him to hang out and he says he'll let me know later.

I understand everyone needs some alone time but I feel like he's just being selfish now. \n\nBut anyways, after I told him all of this his response to me is that he doesn't value the relationship as much as i do. This broke my heart, and he's acting like it's no big deal. I don't want to be in a relationship with someone that doesn't care about me as much as I do them, and even worse, doesn't see anything wrong with not caring as much.

Last weekend we got together for an hour and we held hands and talked for a bit and i thought things were going great. But at school she just acts distant now.... she doesn't start conversation and she sat beside me for an hour and we didn't say one word to each other that meant anything.... she doesn't act like this to anyone else though, and i feel like either she just realized that i'm not worth to get into a relationship with.

Anyone have any other experiences in dealing with this issue and advice? \n\nAnother idea -> I was thinking whether I can return it again (they're sending it back to me) and say that they sent me the wrong model (which is true) Then they will send me the correct SD SDHC card and then I return that for a refund.\nTL;DR:"}

Like, I *love* it and I can eat it straight out of the piping bag; it's so good. So, as we were decorating, I was alternating between icing the roof and icing the inside of my mouth. I noticed my mouth was tingling a bit and the frosting had a sort of acidic after-taste but as we'd bought the kit fairly cheaply from the local supermarket, I thought nothing of it and figured it just wasn't as good quality stuff as the one we got last year. \n\nOnce we'd finished, I was eating the half a bag that was leftover and decided to pipe some onto my girlfriend's nose. As revenge, she piped a moustache onto my upper lip. I laughed, ate it off and started helping to clean up some of the mess we'd made. Everything was fine until I went into the bathroom to wash the sticky remainder off my face and discovered a red 'moustache' above my lips, which had now started to swell.\n\nCut to a few hours later and my skin is still hot and red, I'm sweating and my mouth has that prickly feeling you get when you eat something too-sweet like pineapple.

My problem is whether to continue doing something I do not like doing but might be somewhat successful or let the day come and not present my proposal and try again next time.\n\nHere's the deal, if I could get the right revisions in, I have to present a topic that completely veered away from the topic I wanted to do due to the advise I got from the professor. I personally am confused about the topic itself. Plus, if I did pass this I would have to do experiments I would not be capable of doing because it is something I'm not comfortable with. On the other hand, I will fail the subject and would not be able to use this topic the second time around, but I can try and find another suitable topic I would enjoy researching when I take up Thesis 1 again, something I am actually interested in.\n\nI can't decide on what to do.

Like, I've heard that selling drugs in the United States, for example, is a $30 billion industry and is responsible for the chaos taking place in Mexico right now, as well as drug related violence within the US.  I don't know about other countries so I can't say if this is just an American phenomenon or not.\n\nI'm just curious, because honestly I don't feel comfortable even smoking marijuana since I don't know where the drugs are coming from or where the money I would use to purchase drugs with is going.  And I'm not trying to pull some \"Buying weed supports Al Qaeda, ooga booga booga!\" type nonsense.  I am just curious to see how others feel about this, because I don't think you can really deny that unless you are growing the shit or making the shit yourself there is a possibility that you are putting money into the hands of some bad dudes who are doing horrible things to people in their communities.

I can be outgoing, witty and confident at times, sure, but I'm also a teenager, insecure, etc. she's always had a large social circle and my family have always loved her, but I barely leave my house anymore (a completely different story, my parents are overprotective due to my sisters antics during her youth), and am a bit more reserved around family now. \n\nYesterday, she came round to my house for her birthday, and I said happy birthday and have her presents and shit. My grandparents came round too, and I had my earphones in. When everyone was leaving, I heard my sister complaining to my mum and grandparents about how 'anti-social and weird' I've become. I didn't say anything, didn't want to cause a fuss, but it felt like shit. All I said was 'I'm not deaf you know', but they all pretended not to hear me.\n\nToday, it's her birthday, and while everyone's been sending her Facebook posts saying happy birthday, I didn't since I said it to her face yesterday. My mum told me to send her a message, since she asked her why I hadn't, and told my mum there's no point since I said it yesterday, I don't have to broadcast to the world that I said happy birthday to my sister just for it to be authentic.

Things clicked quickly and we are both very clingy people (which works for us). We get along well although we both have mental health issues (Aspergers and Bipolar for him... and Bipolar and Borderline for me). Our only issue is that I am a sex fiend, and he seems to have no interest in it.\n\n We discussed the issue a couple times and he was rather vague and \"unsure\" of why his sex drive was cooperating... he even reassured me that he WAS attracted to me and that was not the issue.\nWe had sex a couple times, but he never seemed to be 100% there. I started getting snarky with him about his lack of desire (or real passion for anything) and it finally came out that he was not physically attracted to me because he prefers skinny girls. \n\nI was hurt that he had lied to me and then felt like a dick for pushing him so much. He, however, was very upset and terrified that would breakup with him. I asked why he would want to stay with someone that he was not physically attracted to, and he said that he would be a fool to lose me just because he is being shallow. I asked him how he thought a sexless, lie-based relationship would work... and he didn't know.\n\nWe tentatively agreed to stay together... I will try to lose a little weight (I am a bit overweight, not obese though), and he will exercise with me (he isn't skinny either). And he will indulge me every so often with sex.\n\nMy question... is there anything else we can do to fix this? Why the hell would someone be desperate to continue a relationship with someone that they don't find physically attractive? Is this even worth trying to fix?\nTL;DR:"}

This alone causes tension between us, the unpredictable nature of what I do and when I do it clashes with her absolute necessity to be on time and stick to schedules. I often show up 5-10 minutes late to stuff due to last minute fits of imagination, but we've agreed that's alright. It's not just that though.\n\nShe reads textbooks, I play video games.

As a romance, we're wonderful and she completes me, but as human beings I feel like we're both square pegs to each other's round holes.\n\nMy question is, is this normal?

Did mentioning a potential relationship scare her off? I just want to spend more time with her, and maybe I don't know what she meant by taking it slowly?\nTL;DR:"}

But, before we started dating we tried dating in middle school and high school, it didn't work out both times because we were both young and dumb. We've been BEST friends for over 9 years, we would talk all the time and about anything or everything there was no \"line\" for going too far.\n\nWell about 3 months ago I started getting feelings for her, couldn't keep myself away from her, etc. We started dating, things went fast. I told her I loved her, we had sex really quick into the relationship. But now, I just don't know what I feel, I don't really ever want to have sexual acts, lately I find myself wanting to be home, and every little thing bothers me.\n\nI still love her, but I just don't know if she's the one I've meant to be with, and I have no idea what to do since she was best friends with my family before me, so I feel like if anything happens they're going to choose sides and that'll cause a problem. And she also buys me things, and I don't have a job which is nice of her but I feel like if something does happen that's also going to get thrown into my face. I just don't know what to do and it's stressing me out.\nTL;DR:"}

All the work of applying and just one phone call with my ex-classmate changed everything.   \n\nA week later I got a call from a manufacturing company I had applied to, wanting to interview over the phone for \"Job B\" !! Finally, that same week I received an email from a school that had just basically rejected me for a Master's program and telling me that they re-reviewed my application and had changed their mind due to my persistence and due diligence to get admitted.  \n\nIt's been an interesting last month. Now, I did a drug test and waiting on background check for Job A, and got called from the manufacturing company telling me they want to do a second interview and are very interested in me.

Their relationship ended a few years ago, she moved abroad, and over time he and I became close friends. We both asked separately if our friendship was alright and she approved. \n\nLate last year I realized my feelings for him went beyond friendship, and we began a mild flirtation mainly via text message as he told me he felt the same way. He was and still is one of my best friends so at first it was confusing, especially because we were so linked by my best friend, but this year my friend got married.\n\nAnd so we went on a few dates but have only kissed at this point, in part because I've been working quite a bit. But also in part because he's 'afraid of being vulnerable.' He often says one thing but does another, like via text he'll act cavalier but has initiated all of our plans. He talks often of being afraid to open up and yet we spend hours and hours just talking, often late into the night. He's picked me up from the airport after I've been gone, drives over an hour just to take me to dinner and is eager to meet my friends and be a part of my life. But conversely, he speaks of how damaged and sad he is often and my friend mentioned he self harmed at the end of their relationship.\n\nI don't know if this is a phase or if it's just a permanent representation of who he is as a person. I'm afraid to get more invested and him never be able to commit.\nTL;DR:"}

Am I in a position to fix this and how?\nPOST: My identical twin refuses to grow up and I don't know how to fix it. I'm the eldest child and hes the second eldest. I'm the unofficial third adult in the family. \n\nLet me explain the most recent situation. My twin just ordered his textbooks for the next semester. The autofill on his web browser sent the books to our old dorms instead of our residence. \n\nOur mother (50 F) got the email for the order (for whatever reason his chegg account is on her email, another example) and realized the error. When she told him he only had 30 minutes to cancel the order, he would not even stop playing the video game he was playing in an attempt to cancel the time sensitive order (the game is league of legends for gamers here which is more understandable but still). My mother can't do it as she is not very technologically savy. \n\nWhen he eventually relented, never mind that it was his mistake in the first place, he yelled at her \"FINE I'M COMING\". I offered to do it so he didn't have to stop his game and I assumed my mother had ordered the books for him and made the mistake herself. \n\nMy mother was almost in tears as we attempted to cancel the order because he yelled at her. My mother is kind of emotional, as he didn't yell at her that badly. \n\nRegardless, it infuriates me. This isn't the first time he has done something to make our mother cry. In fact this last semester was awful for her and I almost punched him several times as a form of brotherly discipline since he seems to refuse to understand anything else. \n\nIs there anything I can do to solve this? I feel like I can't discipline him as he won't recognize it as discipline and my parents record of discipline is terrible (were good kids but I can count the number of times all four of us have been disciplined on both hands for 20 years of my life). I just hate seeing my mother crying when its something he keeps doing and I hate babysitting a sibling who is 30 seconds younger than me.\nTL;DR:"}

The two young (under 3y/o) male cats beat her up every day causing things like ashtrays to go flying and glasses/bottles getting knocked over as well as the lady cat getting so scared she defecates. The males were just neutered no more than 3 months ago and generally wreak havoc on everything. They've chewed a corner off my study Bible (hence, devil cats), attack the dresses in my closet, scarves, yarn, they kill the outdoor plants on our screened in patio, are always on the counters/stove, they climb the screens outside, and they have repeatedly escaped by breaking the screens. Oh, and they've eaten my cigarettes! Worst of all, the male cats use my records that I keep in a milk crate as a scratching post, I now must keep them covered at all times so my valuable classic rock records aren't destroyed completely (as of now they're just damaged). \n\nI've tried my best to cope by keeping my bedroom door shut, keeping things covered and leaving nothing breakable near the edge of counters but they still manage to fuck shit up at least once a day. They clearly need to go outside to climb trees and kill lizards and run around without making things shatter. My roomie thinks they're fun (even though they knocked everything off his nightstand and stole his glasses, leaving them on the back patio for me to find hours later) and he is afraid they'll get hurt or lost if they're allowed outside. I say they're just fucking cats and let them be free, they're animals and they need space to act upon their wild instincts. He won't budge. The cats howl and cry all day and night. \n\nIs there anything I can do to try and convince him? Its so frustrating and taxing to clean up the cat's messes that I might not live here next semester despite how much I love the house and location. \n\nand no, the squirt bottle doesn't work, but I might try a supersoaker soon just for kicks.\nTL;DR:"}

I worry about what/how much he eats. When he's with me, he's generally pretty good - save for the odd sweet drink with lunch (juice or ice tea, all high in sugar). We both still live at home, and his parents don't exactly cook super healthily - think comfort food. Again, dinner is always served with some cordial of some kind. I just worry about the threat of heart disease, or high cholesterol when he's older. \n\nFor the past 8-9 months, I have made an effort to become healthier. I count my calories, and watch what I eat. I was never overweight, but have lost about 16 lbs from diet and exercise. Basically, I wanted to look good not only for him, but myself too. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI have mentioned to him that I worry about his eating habits, and I can see him trying to change - when we're together, but I think he's still put on a little weight in the time I've known him.\nHe works a desk job, and tells me about the daily piece of cake he has, amongst snacks like chips and whatnot - he'll have entire meals like pasta as snacks sometimes. It makes me sick with worry knowing he's doing this to himself. I don't want to be controlling, or make him feel bad about himself, but I'm scared if he continues to put on weight, I'll lose attraction to him. I've noticed during sex his belly sometimes makes it hard to jerk him off, as it gets in the way.\n\n**I should point out that he hasn't always carried this extra bit of weight, as I've seen photos of him from just a couple years ago where he looks rather slim, so it's only a recent thing. I daresay it's because his metabolism has slowed down, and he hasn't changed his diet to accommodate things**\nTL;DR:"}

We found out she was going to Ohio for med school (OH-HCOM, great DO school) a few months ago. Ever since then, I've pulled away significantly, and I've told her why. She doesn't seem to understand it.\n\nThe relationship I was in before was also long-distance and it ended *badly*. The reasons as to why are numerous, not least of all the long-distance part, but I have just as many misgivings about this girl as I did in my last relationships, if not more (which have grown as we've gone deeper into this relationship).\n\nTruth be told she isn't a terrible match for me and I genuinely like her most of the time. But I'm convinced that long-distance will put an insurmountable strain on our relationship, and I probably won't be convinced otherwise. So I want to end it. The problem (and maybe this isn't a problem, hmm??) is that she keeps making me stay, and promise her to try and see it some other way. I oblige her because I don't hate her, I don't want to hurt her, and I still kinda/sorta like her.

I've given myself a mental deadline of 2 years to either step up the relationship or break it off, I feel I owe it to her either way. \n\nThe relationship itself is great; we are receptive to each other's interests, we get along with the other's friends, and we enjoy each other's company, whether it's just the two of us or out on the town with friends. Additionally, we are both trust each other and are secure (going out for girls/guys nights alone with friends), and there has never been any drama or fighting between us. \n\nWhat flaws I have found in the relationship is a combination of both myself and her. Perhaps I'm afraid of commitments, but I always think about the big picture when I come to major decisions. I'm in the process of looking for another job and don't want to limit myself to my current city. My gf would not dare to move away from her friends and family. Also, I'd like to think I take good care of myself; what I eat and exercising often are very important to me. In contrast, my gf is the opposite, which I find irksome. She is complacent at her sub-par job, with very little initiative to improve her current situation, whether it be improving her job skills or physical health. Lately, she has gotten better with improving herself both physically and mentally, but I feel it's only because I try to push her about it a lot.\n\nI will be the first to admit I'm an amateur with relationships and this relationship has been the most serious one I've been in by far.

Naturally my girlfriend, who sleeps like a normal human being for the most part, started getting a little bummed out recently on account that we are living on two different schedules. \n\nSo, about 3 weeks ago she started trying to wake me up when she felt my 6 hour quota had been met to give us a few hours of quality time together before she went to bed. Very fair, but I'm also very deep sleeper, so she was very frustrated that she only got me out of bed a handful of times with the majority of those consisting of me roaming around the apartment like a husk with only one eye open for the first hour of consciousness. We had a talk about it, and I assured her that this wouldn't be forever, and I joked that if she really wanted to get me up maybe she should blow me into awareness. We laughed, made up, and the week pushed on. \n\nFast forward to Thursday night, I'm in the strong embrace of an epic sleep, adventuring through the alternate reality that is my dreamscape when I feel this beautiful, warming sensation emanating from my loins, embracing my whole body, and I was so content, so happy, so relaxed until it was all shattered by a high pitched scream. A mixture of anger, complete horror, and utter disbelief which manifested itself into the words \"WHAT THE FUCK!\" Simultaneously, of a sudden my face is now being splashed with some luke warm mystery liquid, and a slightly warmer liquid is gently raining down everywhere. I snap awake and realize...\n\nI just pissed in my girlfriends mouth, she spit that mouthful of piss in my face, and I'm now continuing to rain down a morning, or in this case evening wood sprinkle system-esque cascade of piss.

This is probably needlessly long, apologies in advance.\n \nBackground story:\nI'm in college, we're having a party at my house. I'm in my friends room smoking with a bunch of people, an hour goes by, eventually there's a group of girls in there of which I only know one, and one of them is sitting next to me on the couch. We talk for a while, she asks me to show her how to smoke this, blah blah irrelevant details, we wind up making out for a while before she goes home. I friend her on FB, we chat for 3 days, she gives me her number because she \"doesn't like FB\". We meet up at Spring Fling so I can give her tickets to our afterparty, cue afterparty, I see her and say hi, dance with her group for a little while but don't do anything with her directly, later see her dancing with a dude and I get discouraged, turns out he was actually just a friend. I don't text her for 5 days, she hits me up out of the blue Wednesday night. We talk for a while, she stops responding in the morning, I initiate the next night, she responds. This happens throughout finals week, and Thursday night my friend convinces me to send her a text asking her to get coffee before we go back for summer. I then run into her downtown like 20 minutes later, say hey, dance next to her for a bit, she seems smiley and into it, but the longer I don't actually dance with her, the more she loses interest. By the end of Friday, she never responded to coffee, and 5 days without texting goes by. Now, the nail in the coffin:I texted her this Wednesday \"Hey! How's home been?\", no response. I'm pretty sure I'm dead in the water, any help from anyone? Blegh.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest\nTITLE: You and me baby ain't nothing but mammals\nPOST: This is something I noticed happening starting about 5 months ago, but it's been getting worse and has been weighing on my mind for a while. It's really pointless, but I'm not sure if I'm crazy, hormonal, or if this is normal.\n\nHere's the situation: For some reason I can't figure out, I'm all of a sudden attracted to male characters and celebrities from movies and TV shows. Back in high school, a lot of my girlfriends had these sorts of crushes. I never did. Sure, whichever celebrity or character it was, I thought they were good looking, rightly enough, but I never reacted the way they did (the \"Oh my god, they are sooooo hot, all I can think about is [name of actor]\" type of crush). So why, at the age of 22, am I suddenly swooning over what essentially equates to an illusion (because characters don't exist and celebrities will never enter into my realm of reality). It's not even the rather innocent musings of my former teenage peers, these are weird, womanly desires that are completely illogical, but very distracting. Also usually pretty explicit, which just adds to the distraction.\n\nTo a lesser extent I also feel this way about people I encounter in my daily life, but its significantly easier to ignore. The reality of life is that perfect strangers will remain perfect strangers, so I can have these thoughts in private and not bother anyone. \n\nBut why, all of a sudden, can I not keep my brain out of the gutter? Do other people experience a sudden upswing in the number of people they find attractive for no apparent reason? It makes me feel skanky and silly, like I can't \"keep it in my pants\" by considering everyone, real or fake, a prospect. I'm writing it off as hormones, but damned if these hormones aren't making a fool out of me.\n\nSo yeah, I know it's silly and pointless, but I can't shake this feeling and I had to write it out because sometimes, for other problems, it has helped me figure out the reasoning.\nTL;DR:"}

She has kept our relationship a secret from her parents because they are super religious/racially prejudiced and would not accept it (I am agnostic), and probably wouldn't accept me initially. My entire family has met her.\nShe is not particularly religious but her parents don't know that, and wouldn't be happy if they found out. She told them 1 year into our relationship that she was interested in me romantically (she didn't want to tell them the full truth that we were together) and they told her that they could never accept her marrying someone who doesn't share their religion, and she backed down. \nThis situation of carrying on a secret relationship is making me miserable and she knows this, but she wants to wait until September, when she hopes to be financially independent, before she tells her parents. She is afraid that they will cut her off and stop talking to her and currently we are living on student loans. \nWe have talked about marriage in the past, and we are very serious about each other, but I am finding it harder to be hopeful and having a really hard time being as supportive as I should be because she has said she would tell them at our graduation and recently she backed out of that. I try to tell her how I really want her to tell them soon but she gets upset that I am pressuring her and she wants to do it on her own terms, so I just keep my sadness inside and end up displacing my anger to everything else in the world. \nMy fear is that she will tell them and they will react bad and she will not be able to choose me over them, or she just won't tell them, and dealing with this heartbreak will compromise my ability to function as a new doctor and will affect my career. Should I take this chance on her and give her another 5 months, or should I break it off before I start training if she hasn't moved on telling her parents about me?\nTL;DR:"}

In January of 2010, I got my act together and lost 35lbs over the course of 8 months through Weight Watchers and training for a 5k. I also became a vegetarian. I was SO HAPPY, and over the next school year my weight fluctuated a bit but I always got back on track and maintained for the most part.\n\nThen in March I found out that a long-time boyfriend had been cheating on me, and I lost another 10 pounds, counting calories but using most of them on vodka.

I wish I was exaggerating about that paragraph...\n\nNow, I was maintaining at 175, but stress has pushed me to 180. I have an awful relationship with food, and dieting is torture because of it.

My closest friend is a 28M who just sort of went through a break up.  He and I are very close and talk pretty much every day, but there has never been anything romantic between us.  No sex, no kissing, not even a single date.  We have openly discussed why dating each other (even if I *were* single) would end badly and he has openly told me that he would not sleep with a married woman and is not a threat to my marriage (not that he was a threat to begin with, but I appreciate the sentiment).\n\nAnyway, my friend is about to move to the completely opposite side of the country for a job.  We live on the east coast and he is moving to the west coast.  He asked me, in a totally serious way, if I would like to road trip with him to this new city when he leaves in a few weeks.  Now, I can't do it because I can't get the time off work in any case, so I told him no.\n\nI just can't help but wonder, though, if asking someone to drive across the country with you is a little too personal/intimate for a platonic friendship?  I mean, that would involve at least one or two nights in a hotel along the way.  Is it possible that my friend is developing feelings for me, or am I just reading too much into it?\nTL;DR:"}

I am convinced that I would probably spend my life with her, but we both agreed that its still too early to talk about marriage. We have been through a lot in a short period, we found out she was pregnant but suffered a miscarriage. While we both get sad about it sometimes, we both feels like we have grown closer from it.\n\nYesterday, I was on my phone and she glanced over and saw that I had watched porn in my search history. At first I tried to act like I didn't know what it was but I did tell her the truth because I didn't feel right lying to her. Ever since then she has seemed distant, on her phone, and upset. Whenever I try to talk to her about it she says that she doesn't want to and doesn't want to think about it. I know I should give her some space but at the same time I don't want her to think that she's not good enough or that I don't think she's perfect. When we tried talking about it last night she said that it her upset because \"I was getting pleasure from another person\". I don't view porn like that at all, I know that its not real and will never be as great as a real connection with someone. She seems upset because she seems me risque pictures and said that if I'm going to masturbate I should use those which I told her I usually do but she said usually wasn't enough.\n\nIf she wanted me to stop I obviously would, She can be insecure but I love her just the way she is.

This happened a good 10 or 11 years ago, when creamsavers actually still existed. I was around 7 at the time.\n\nMe and a buddy of mine were playing Tekken 3, minding our own business. My sister was sitting on the couch behind us, enjoying a bag of creamsavers. Now, like any wide-eyed kid growing up in the early 2000s, I was unhealthily addicted to video games. To the point where I'd literally blot out anything else going on around me. My friend was the same way. We would never take our eyes off of the screen until we were finished. \n\nSo, this proved extremely bad for my sister, who chose the worst time ever to choke on something. A creamsaver had gone down the wrong pipe, and she was gasping for air before she knew it. Of course, I didn't know this, because I was too immersed in Playstation to acknowledge anything going on behind me. Even when my sister got up, slapped BOTH me and my friend on the back, AND tried to get our attention by reaching for our game controllers, we ignored her. Finally, she did the only thing she could think of- she flung herself onto the couch. Impossibly, the creamsaver came loose and she coughed it out of her mouth. \n\nI didn't even realize what had happened until my grandmother walked in and pointed out that my sister was crying.

So anyway; a few days ago, one of the matches that came up for me was her. I had no idea that she was on eHarmony, and she sent me a smile. I sent her one back then asked her if she knew it was me she had sent a smile to. She acted oblivious at first, until I mentioned that it was on eHarmony then she laughed and pointed out the humor in matching two people who already knew each other. \n\nI agreed and and it turns out that she is back in NS for the summer and she had just changed locations on her profile. After a couple hours of just chatting on FB, she said \"So, where do we go from here?\"\n\nI asked her if she wanted to go to dinner some time and she said sure, and I asked her what she liked, and as a result we're meeting at a steakhouse on saturday evening for dinner.\n\n---\nLeast to say, I'm a somewhat awkward person, and after 3 years of not having an in depth conversation with her, I'm not sure how to spark conversation.

My boyfriend decides to leave once he gets his Associate's Degree which will be in Spring 2015. However, he says its still not set in stone and that I'm the biggest thing holding him back since he doesn't want to leave me. \n\nBefore my boyfriend came along, I was seeing someone who eventually left for the Marines. We weren't exclusive, but I was deeply in love with him. I wrote to him during his training and we spoke everyday after. I was very lonely and had relationships the first year he was gone...\n\nI'm scared to be left again and even though I support my boyfriend's decisions, I don't think I'm emotionally equipped for the military lifestyle.

My girlfriend of 6 months loves to check her \"on this day\" page on her facebook which for those that don't know is a list of all her posts from the past on that particular day. What I don't like about it is she always has to see her old posts and memories of her and her ex on there. She had been with this guy for 4 years and we got together only a month after they had broken up. I know that's not ideal to get with someone after they've just gotten out of a long term relationship but I figured I'd go for it anyways and see if it worked out. I just know that it takes time to heal from a breakup and I feel like her seeing these memories everyday can't help her move on like she should. Maybe by now it doesn't affect her as much because it's been over half a year since they've broken up but I just sometimes wonder. They ended on bad terms and she claims she was over him long before they officially broke up but who really knows. Is this something that I should be concerned with or should I just let it go? I really don't know if I should approach her about it. Thanks\nTL;DR:"}

Lots of stuff about her, about emotions... It's just a brain dump in there.\n\nUnprompted, she cried to me about it last night. She had read them last week and apparently it was majorly eating at her. I reacted calmly, but I was in shock a little bit. I never got mad at her, and she was obviously feeling guilty.\n\nWe tried to talk about what she read, but really that just made it worse. And stupid me said, \"We may as well spill other stuff that's on our chest while we're at it.\" And I let her know that I had kept naked pictures of a friend that I stumbled across, but had long since gotten rid of them. \n\nThought it would calm her down about what she did.\n\nIt didn't.

I have never had a younger sister before so maybe this is my first time having to deal with a situation like this. However I have always been encouraging with her previous boyfriends. My wife was also upset with her sister dating this guy but my wife was easier to say that we should wait to see how things play out. (My wife knows about this guy's past but the sister does not.)\n\nSo I am brainstorming ways to tell my sister-in-law that this guy is no good without sounding too controlling and make her want him more. My wife and I think if we pressure too much for her not to see him then she will want to see him more out of defiance.\n\nThank you for any advice.\nTL;DR:"}

While there, she got two insect bites from what she assumes were mosquitos, who knows. Just warning you that this is gonna sound very gross: the bites had swollen, became obviously infected and full of pus. \n\nWhen she came back, they were the same. She's just been cleaning, applying neosporin and putting bandaids over the bites. It looks incredibly disgusting, God. It's even caused her some pain where it hurts to stand which is doubly shitty because she works at Walmart where she STANDS FOR 8 DAMN HOURS. She got back here in July 18th, and her leg is still very ugly and obviously infected and swollen. \n\nHere is the annoying, problematic part: she vehemently refuses to go to the doctor. She claims that when she was younger, she dealt with this all the time in the Philippines, that this is just a normal part of life and that no one in het village bothered to see doctors about this stuff. She grew up in a rural part of the Philippines where ya know, medical care isn't in great supply so that's probably why people in the village didn't go to the doctor. Couple this with the fact that my mom is a cheapskate to the extreme and you can imagine how stubborn and frustrating this is. \n\nMy dad has told her repeatedly she needs to go to a doctor and she ends up yelling at him that it's nothing, that he doesn't know anything, that she's taking care of it. \n\nHer leg is swollen and DISGUSTING. I have brought it up to her as well but again, she refuses. I've even offered to pay for her visit but nope. \n\nPlease give me some guidance.\nTL;DR:"}

It's been a really great but confusing relationship and things have only gotten more complicated. We started off casual and we've stayed, \"open\" since - as in we've agreed to fool around with other people as long as we use protection and tell the other. I've been too busy/tired to do any dating beyond him, whereas he's fooled around with a friend's roommate and has been super quiet/passive about it since. I think it's helped since he's trying harder. Given enough time, I might have done the same, too. I've met a huge chunk of his family and friends and he keeps wanting to meet mine. I've been holding back and holding back from that - just in time for another problem! He wants to move out of the country. Almost weekly, he'll bring up dreams of moving elsewhere. I still live at home, finishing school but I've traveled abroad; he hasn't but he has the freedom from his job to work & move. I don't know if we should continue since he obviously has one foot out the door. Should I just pull the plug to avoid the discomfort of an awkward, maybe even long distance break up? I don't want to be a dope and expect him to invite me, especially since we've never even discussed moving in together. (I wanted to live with him eventually.) He won't even talk about this hypothetical dream with a hypothetical me in it. I've tried it and he got uncomfortable. I don't want to ruin his openness to talk about these things, especially since I'm pretty uncertain of my future, too.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [21F] with my boyfriend [21M] for almost 2 years, I know this might sound shallow...but I'm not really getting any gifts back\nPOST: I know this might sound like a shallow post, but lately it has been bothering me more and more. As v-day is coming up, I realized that my bf is not really planning anything at all. We won't be spending it together anyway, but I already am having something delivered to him for the day. He, however, doesn't even know the address I'm staying at and has no interest of asking me. For last valentines day, we didn't do anything. We didn't even go out to dinner. He said he was going to get me the gift that I wanted, but it took him over a month after to finally order it. For our 1 year, we didn't even go out to dinner. I made him a very special gift, but I got nothing in return. For Christmas, he said he was going to get me something (I got him something and he knew that), and then when Christmas came around, I got nothing. \n\nThis isn't a dealbreaker because I obviously love him a lot, but it especially makes me shitty when people around me are being spoiled by their boyfriends. I don't want him to spend a lot of money on me at all. I don't care if the gifts are handmade or $5. The reason I feel like a bitch even posting this and why I'm uncomfortable sharing this with him is because he got me a fairly expensive birthday gift (although it was also late by a month and I felt awful reminding him to buy it several times), and he received money from his parents to come visit me (which also costs a lot). So I feel like a spoiled brat asking him to do even more, but at the same time, I'm just looking for small gestures...\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/running\nTITLE: Likely ITBS Issue\nPOST: Hi all,\n\nI started running about 2.5 years ago and after the first few months had extreme knee pain. I usually ran outside, still with pain, but I can remember running on a treadmill and my knee hurting so bad after, I couldn't get into my car. It was probably ITBS. I quit stretching and the pain went away.\n\nFlash forward to today. For well over a year, my running schedule was three 6-milers during the work week with a longer run on the weekend (9-12 miles). I started training for an upcoming marathon and my plan has taken me from 10 miles, 11, 12, then 14 this past weekend. Fourteen has been the longest I have ever run. In all of these rungs, including the earlier schedule, I didn't experience any knee pain nor did I stretch.\n\nI ran 4 miles on Monday after the 14 miler on Saturday. My knee was killing me. I decided to stretch the knee Monday night and will do so again tonight. It is definitely tight in my knee area. I'm scheduled to do a 7 mile run tomorrow, but am worried about what may happen pain wise. Further, my training schedule has me doing 16 miles on Saturday. I see this as a huge hurdle to cross - if I do the 16, I feel like the rest of the training will be smooth. \n\nMy question is: should I rest until my knee is 100%? This may sound like the obvious thing, but I should add that Saturday afternoon I volunteered and had to be on my feet for about 4 hours (after the 14 miler). Will sitting out a week or two impact the marathon (its in early December)?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been seeing this girl about almost 3 months and there is a lot to like about her. She's kind hearted, happy, beautiful, and really really likes me. What has me curious though is the fact that she is texted by another male almost everytime we hang out.\n\nSome important backgorund information is that she has a history of being in shitty to meidocre relationships. She's told me stories about some guys she's dated and it blows my mind how she ended up with them in the first place. None of them have been physically abusive but there has been verbal and emotional abuse in the past.\n\nIn her defense she has told some guys who constantly text her (two ex bfs) to stop contacting her. But compared to the amount of men that are in contact with her it seems minimal. She will text these guys who are her friends frequently and will arrange to meet for coffee, or in some other cases dinner. I'm not specifically worried about her physically cheating but at what point would it be emotional cheating? In my previous relationships my gf had mostly female friends and the male friends I knew and they respected our relationship. \n\nI could just being feelig jealous, is it normal for a girl in a relationship to meet other men in casual locations so frequently? I know she's met with friends from highschool, she's meeting with one later today as well. She also texts one of her exs too. She's all very open about it though and states it's strictly platonic.\n\nI explained to her that single men will likely have feelings for her, even if they don't outright express it. We discussed it and she felt very worried that these male friends have alterior ideas and that these people she's viewed of as friends want to get into her pants. I don't want to outright come out and say you can't see these people, because if they are truly just friends then that would suck.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how to handle this. I'm not worried about her cheating but I am worried that she is unaware of these guys intentions and because she has a history of being with shitty men it might suggest she has a tough time screening their personalities?

I usually go to him first for things like when I'm having a panic attack or just simply upset about something. His response is usually \"I can't help you\", and most recently, just hangs up the phone.\n\nThis summer he's threatened to leave me twice if I don't make myself happier, which just puts so much more stress on myself. Eventually I just let him be until I pulled myself together and everything was okay. \n\nLast night I had a really, really bad panic attack. Hyperventilating, screaming, crying, convulsing, choking, the whole works. I was talking to him on the phone and he just hung up on me. Just like that. Eventually my sister had to come in and medicate me with something so I would calm down.\n\nToday after school I was trying to cheer him up because he's also incredibly stressed right now (parents are screwed up, school is rough this year) and he just told me \"well now you know how it feels to deal with this.\" I don't know how to feel about any of this.\n\nAll I ask of him is to support me and he thinks that means I'm making it a duty for him to actively do something about my happiness. I told him I can't control it but I started going to therapy so I'm trying to find a way. I dont know what to do. My best solution is to just not go to him with my problems and be happy around him no matter what but that's a terrible idea.

I am the more emotional of the two of us and she doesn't usually emote or feel the need to discuss feelings. That should not be mistaken as inability to get pissed or hurt or dwell. But me dwelling is the bigger issue. I dwell too much on what we don't have, what I feel I am not getting from the relationship, what she does or doesn't do. Then it explodes in an argument. After, I realize I was focused on all the wrong things and seem to have lost the ability to re-focus on the good stuff, of which there is plenty.\n\nSo, what tips or guidance or little voices in your head can you implement to help focus on the good things and not wake up dwelling on stuff that a) you can't change, and b) is fairly minor and isn't worth a fight, and c) you know isn't productive to dwell on in the first place? \n\nYes, I am planning to get some personal counseling but that is only one component.

Yes, in the county I live in, owners are required to keep their dogs on a 7 foot (max) leash. \n\nThis evening I had another encounter with a 40lb+ dog who ran uptrail 30m to me while in view of it's owner, and began barking, growling, and jumping within arms reach. It circled around me as the owner tried to get control of it saying all the while how friendly he is. \n\nReading through some posts, some of you may reassure me your dog is well-trained and has 100% recall, etc. Keep in mind that when your dog interacts with strangers, that person has no idea the training (or lack thereof) your dog has. In this regard, I maintain the frame of mind that any dog off leash may act aggressively and possibly attack myself or whomever I'm with. To this end, I have been carrying some form of defensive tool, be it a knife, walking stick, or like tonight, a SOG Tomahawk that just happened to be in my backpack. There was enough time in the above instance for me to take earbuds out, take my backpack off, open it up to pull out my SOG, and unsheath it before the dog was under control.\n\nAs the caretaker of 2 old dogs, I would not like to cause harm to another's dog. However, I'm not going to hike without anything to defend myself with. So for all of you who prefer to keep your dog(s) off leash when around strangers on public land, tell me why you are willing to risk your dog's safety and possibly your own well-being. If your dog hurts another person, you are opening yourself up to a smorgasbord of problems. As I told the owner of tonight's aggressive dog, you might not meet someone as friendly as me.

He has an unusual name, is from a small town, and was 18 at the time, so there is no doubt in my mind that it is him. I contacted him about the article, and he claims to have never heard of this before, and has since stopped replying to me.\n\nIf it was an isolated incident then I would probably believe that it wasnt him, but I've noticed in the past that he prefers girls aged 14/15 (he's 20), and someone posted on his facebook wall telling him to stop texting her 12 year old sister because it was getting creepy...\n\nHe coaches rugby for girls under 18, and I'm not sure how he passed the relevant checks.

He only lies to me when he is afraid of me being angry, but I find it absolutely unacceptable. For me, trust is easily broken, especially when I've asked him specifically *not* to do the things that would harm our relationship.\n\nHe sort of has a lying problem. Really tiny things, but he lies very fluidly, and very frequently, to his family and to me as well. I've snooped (I know, I feel terrible, and we already talked about it and I don't do it anymore) and what I've found (nudes of other girls, stuff like that) has made me really rethink how he values me. He knows how honesty is my #1 in a relationship. Ben and I talked about it and everything was fine after that but I still catch him lying to me, and I'm not afraid to call him out on it, but it upsets more than anything else does.\n\nI'm not sure if I should have another talk with him, granted I find out anything else, or just let it slide, because I worry that I'm being too hard on him.

We ended up going to colleges that are pretty close to each other, so we started hanging out and eventually dating freshman year. We have been pretty serious thus far in our relationship (we have been dating 4 months). We have grown very close to each other and, she means so much more to me than any of my other girlfriends ever did.\n\nNow my girlfriend doesn't drink alcohol, and doesn't party either, but she has always accepted that my partying was a part of who I am and she was okay with it. Up until last weekend. I spent 3 days in Canada with a school club I'm in. and of course I took advantage of the lower drinking age.\n\nOne I got home she calls me and said she is tired of worrying so much about me being out drinking. (She has never expressed severe concern before). She tells me that, she doesn't want to spend as much time with me, so she can become less attached and not worry about me getting hurt, or cheating while drunk, or getting a Minor in possession. She wants to be less serious so she doesn't get hurt.\n\nI could care less about drinking. Hell I don't even do it that much. Big partying is like a once a month sort of thing for me. I'd give it up in a heartbeat for her, and I have told her that multiple times.

We recently moved in together, and while a lot of it has been really fun it's really just revealed to me how I've rushed in to things and am not ready for this much commitment.\n\nThere have been minor issues in our relationship (no large red flags) and a thing or two we've been working on. The reasons I want to split are rather things to do with myself than problems with him. I've been a serial monogamist for the past 10 years and need a break, I've been abused on and off for years by different people and that has created trust and sex issues, etc. Basically, a really honest \"it's not you, it's me\".\n\nThings came to a head when I cheated on him on Thursday night (this is not someone he knows). I told myself that this meant I couldn't continue to date him (even though I want to...) because if I keep on dating him, I have to tell him. If I break up with him...then I don't need to tell him. I'm not breaking up with him to be with another person, so **I feel like telling him that I've cheated would simply add insult to injury. I'm his first girlfriend and I want to avoid giving him long-term trust issues that might hinder him from dating again.**\n\nI've already told him that I need out. Do I need to tell him that I cheated?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: So my truck just got towed and I want to make a point. Do I have a case?\nPOST: I go to school at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo California and recently parked my truck for about an hour at an off campus housing place called mustang village.  I got back to find my truck had been towed and the charge is $227 to get it out.\n\nI really don't understand how towing is legal at all in the first place, but that aside here's what I have to say.  They have guest parking close to residential parking but they are not very explicitly differentiated.  There is a sign in the very front of the large lot that says you will be towed if you park in the residential spots.  However, the guest spots and the residential spots are purposely difficult to distinguish and the truck was towed because a random guy patrolling for the towing company saw it (not because anyone called it in because there were several open spots around me and I was only there for an hour).\n\nSo I picked up my truck today and paid them on card.  I really wanted to fight them over the sign and the obvious trap this is, but I need my truck to get to school and get around and leaving it there risks building up extra charge for every day.\n\nWhat options do I have?  Can I put a stop payment on the card?  I did sign all of their garbage, credit card statement included primarily because I needed my truck back.  This simply adds to the depth of the trap (you have to give them money because you NEED your car back at which point challenging it is in your hands and no one wants to expend that much time and effort).\nTL;DR:"}

We moved in together after two months. \n\nHe works full time and goes to uni. He is a frat boy, enjoys drinking (on occasion), and is a stoner. He is forgetful, easily frustrated and labile, paranoid, can be a bit unappreciative, and a bit of a shit head. He can be romantic and caring, but is rather neutral most of the time. \n\nI got to uni full time. I am a shy and introverted, more or less straight edge, type of guy. I don't drink or do any other sort of drug. I'm romantic amd caring (by comparison); I can be a shit head, am easily annoyed, and sometimes hate how his actions (like toking).\n\nWe had a bit of a spat earlier with him cheating on me (over text, not in person). I agreed to give him a second chance, and things have been more or less alright. I feel he's being honest in saying he hasn't engaged in said actions, but am weary due to the one incident. He has pissed off both of my best friends through his actions - one is civil, one is spiteful.\n\nOverall, I feel like our differences in lifestyles are what made us attracted to one another, but at the same time feel they will drive us apart because our hobbies and interests don't overlap. Hence my current feelings of unknowing \n\nI'm not looking for the perfect man, but my naivet\u00e9 wishes my SO shared at least some of the traits in my perfect man. Not that he doesn't, just more of them on occasion. He tells me I'm too good for him, and I'm starting to believe it. I just don't know what to do.\n\n[\nTL;DR:"}

The next day she texts me a book claiming she doesn't know what she wants and that she's sorry. Very vague, and extremely distant. I just need to know whether you guys think the squeeze is worth the juice. I feel like I've been put on hold so she can pursue someone else, but I might be wrong (given #1) and this might just be a coping mechanism and she might really still be messed up, hence the whole asking-for-a-second-opinion-on-Reddit thing.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Please Help Reddit! (Did I uncover stolen credit card or am I being paranoid?)\nPOST: So some background first. I've been trying to earn some extra moeny online and one of the sites that seemed helpful was a site called usertesting (I'm not trying to promote anything so I won't link it). The concept is fairly simple. When you register, you are placed on wait until someone places a new website for testing. Usually it would be a beta facebook game or a new website that needs comments on navigation/reliability/ease of use etc. However, today I say a job posted that asked me to make purchases and sell items (iPads, Kindles, etc.) from Glyde.com. Thinking it was a new website, I went ahead and started with their instructions. Being paranoid as I was I entered fake information and they supplied a credit card (I took a screen shot and have the info). However, by step 7 or 8 of their process they told me to go to gamespot.com/gamemarket to make some purchases and that's when the alarm bells really started ringing. I quickly decided to decline to review the rest of the video and cancelled all the purchases/work I had done. \n\nNow I've done many reviews already on legit start up websites, and this one definitely seemed shady. At the same time I'm trying to understand what benefit the thieves would get if they had a stolen credit card because all the purchases would have been made with my name/address (I didn't even provide a real one and I canceled all of them). Am I being paranoid and perhaps it was gamespot and glyde trying to test their new services or something? Lastly, if it is a stolen credit card is there a way to report it to anyone and check? Just want to help out before anything terrible happens. Thanks! \n\nP.S. Just to be on the safe side the websites aren't made by usertesting, but anyone can sign up and use their service.\nTL;DR:"}

How do I approach this situation?\nPOST: Hi Redditors of Reddit, There is this girl. She is wonderful and amazing. I am head over heels for her but I feel like I am running myself into a trap. We have so much in common. She is Taiwanese but was born in Australia, I'm not Taiwanese but I did grow up in Asia, so it is easy to connect with her and she has mentioned that I am easy to talk to. Anyway, moving on. She has a boyfriend that lives back in Taiwan. They only started dating once she moved here, so it is more of an online relationship and she often complains about it. We started hanging out and it seems like she is attracted to me and everyone around us thinks we are dating or that we are cute together. She is constantly leaning on me, we go out together, I can put my arm around her and all that... No problem there. Here's where the problem is. When we are not together, it's almost as if she isn't interested in me anymore. She always seems to have something better to do. We Skype at night before we go to sleep but during the day, it's as if she doesn't even know me. I don't know how to approach the situation. Do I make a move? Do I try to just move on?

I'll avoid confrontation and hang my hat off the shade to get a few more inches. The sun is off my face but still bouncing off my phone screen. Out of the corner of my eye I can see that the glare from my screen is hitting him right in the face. PERFECT.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Not sure if we should stay together for this... (x-post from r/longdistance)\nPOST: A little background: I'm a 24/f and met my 27 year-old boyfriend online in the beginning of March. I wasn't really looking for anything serious, more just dating and having fun with it since I had recently gotten out of a three-year relationship. After emailing for three weeks, we finally met up and there was an immediate connection, spark, an attraction. We really hit it off and continued talking and going on dates and I realized that I was actually really starting to develop feelings for him. About two weeks ago, though we were already exclusive for a few weeks, we made it official. I am falling really hard for him and can see this being the real deal.\n\nHere is the problem: His job requires international travel, usually minimal. He has been approached, however, about an incredible opportunity to go to Southeast Asia for 1-2 years. This opportunity would give him new challenges and experience at work and would undoubtedly be beneficial to his long term career goals.\n\nWe talked about things and agreed that if the opportunity comes through, which is quite likely, then we are at least going to try to make it work. We agree that it could work and both really care about the other, but realize the incredible challenges in LDRs, especially when a relationship is so new. He also feels terrible about the whole situation, and doesn't want to put me in the position of 'waiting around' for him. He feels that if we try it and did break up, it would likely be because he would feel guilty doing that to me. As I mentioned, I think this could be it for me and at this point, while I am hesitant to try it (especially if he's gone for two years, with some visits every 3-4 months), I absolutely think it would be worth it. I've never connected with anyone, nor have I ever felt quite like this before.\n\nI know that no one can tell me what to do, but I'd love to read some stories and experiences, and would love to see if anyone has any insight or advice.\n\nThank you so much.\nTL;DR:"}

Met through a mutual friend and then she applied at my part time job later on and we got a lot closer. She's been in a relationship with a guy for 5 years and i've been just dating around. Nothing too serious.\n\nOur relationship is 100% platonic (I know right?) to the point where we agree that the other is attractive, but it's not something i'd ever want to do and vice versa. Her boyfriend knows we spend a lot of time together alone and he knows me and knows i'm an upstanding morally well adjusted person. (Would never cheat, take advantage of anyone, and I don't like to string people along)\n\nSo the problem isn't any of this...it's the fact that i'm now starting to get rather serious in dating. Me and my best friend actually have study sessions (college and we're both commuters) and sometimes she stays over at my house. Never in the same bed or anything (it's the principle) although sometimes we drink a bit and just watch netflix or movies. Never made a move on her or anything and vice versa. Once again BF knows about this and he's fine with it, because they've got a pretty mature relationship.\n\nI know people seem weird with genders sometimes and I always keep my new relationships tied to my friendships. Many people (here I see it a lot) would think it's a huge red flag to be that close to someone and not suspect infidelity or something along those lines. \n\nAny suggestions on how I could be clear with exactly what this \"situation\" is with potential serious relationships? And before you ask if early on someone told me I needed to stop having her stay over i'd agree to it. But the study sessions actually help a lot.\nTL;DR:"}

We actually used to sit side by side back then as well, but now it's different, she looks so much more interesting and beautiful, which makes her pretty popular around here, but also makes her seem like way out of my league... During this term I got to know her a bit better, and talk to her and so on, and I usually make her laugh. A lot.\n\nBut that's it.

This was maybe 4 years ago during my sophomore year of high school.\n\nIt started one night when me and some friends were drinking at my house. I had either just started dating or talking to a girl and I had invited her and her friends over to come drink with us. It was all fine and dandy until the alcohol really started to hit.\n\nFor starters here, we were all still pretty new to drinking. It's not like we all knew our limits or anything, we just drank as much as we could to get drunk and have fun. Cut maybe 2 hours into the night, the girl I'm talking to is vomiting everywhere and one of her friends is balling her eyes out. Why? You guessed it! Her dad died x amount of years back.\n\nAfter that night we didn't really see her much and being the assholes we were, if she was ever brought up we would say something like \"the girl with the dead dad\" or \"dead dad girl.\" I'm not condoning us being assholes like that but we really didn't mean it in any bad way, it was just the easiest way to refer to her after that night. When you're 16 and have to deal with a drunk girl falling over in tears for a few hours hearing about a dead parent when you DON'T EVEN KNOW HER it becomes a little much.\n\nFast forward a bit farther, maybe a month or two, I'm now dating the one girl and am in the car with her, a friend, and none other than the sister of the girl who lost it that night. We were telling random party stories when that night got brought up. I nonchalantly referred to her as \"dead dad girl\" as I had any other time I'd told that story and immediately felt a horrible awkward silence in the car. It took me a good 5 minutes to realize what I had done but it was too late to fix that.\n\nAs a bonus, to make it EVEN WORSE, I told this girl I loved her maybe a month later because I was an idiot, broke up with her a week after, and got verbally fucked by the sister from the car.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [28F] am getting married in six months. Very close to ex's immediate family but ex cheated and it was a bad breakup. How do I handle wedding invites?\nPOST: I dated my ex for seven years with a few breaks in between. He left me for someone else. We didn't speak for a year but then we reconnected and got back together. He cheated shortly after and we broke up. Safe to say it was a bad breakup that occurred about 2 years ago.\n\nHowever, his family are truly wonderful people. They have gone out of their way to be very nice and accommodating of me over the years that I have known them. He has three younger sisters and I am very close to all of them. Even after the many breakups, I used to hang out with them constantly and be in touch. Same with his mother. She really looked after me as I was her own daughter. I managed to continue to have relationships with all of them despite the way my ex treated me and the sour ending. I am still friends with the sisters and mother but see them less now simply because we have all gotten busy with our own lives and I no longer attend their family events as I once used to.\n\nI am getting married in six months to a wonderful man. He is very easy going and is comfortable with the relationship that I have with my ex's family. He knows that my ex is not a threat to our relationship because I have avoided contact with him all this time.\n\nHow do I handle wedding invites? The hens party will be easy since it's all girls and I can invite his sisters without any issues. But the actual wedding is what I am concerned about. Is there a tactful way that I can invite my ex's family (3 sisters, mother and father) and not include the ex? It gets complicated because they all live together. All sisters and my ex under one roof with their parents. To add, his family doesn't know the nitty gritty details of why he broke up but they do know it was due to some shady behaviour on his part (they had already witnessed him leaving me for someone else once).\nTL;DR:"}

Ever since we have started dating, she seems really distant over text messages. Literally, taking a day to reply. \n\nThis would normally be annoying but bearable, as when we talk in person everything is still amazing as usual. However, she has just left to go away with her family over the holidays for just under three weeks, im really worried about not talking to her over this period of time & I miss her crazily so the lack of communication is really getting to me. I am really upset, as this is the first girl I have had real feelings and emotions for. This also makes it difficult to have a flowing conversation, so the short two or three message conversations we have are seemingly aimless.\nTL;DR:"}

IT'S FREAKING ME OUT!\nPOST: My parents divorced in 1997 after my sister (22F) had her brain tumor removed. All I remember from my childhood was a VERY sick sibling, stressed out parents who hated eachother, constant fighting and hiding in my room. My older sister (27) and I heard them fight non stop 99% of our childhood. After my sister's surgery, my parents finally divorced (which at such a young age we knew was coming for a very long time). A very long and awful story later, they drug out a custody battle over us for TWELVE years (kept fighting after my older sister and I were over 18). They were horrible to eachother basically my entire life. Turning us against eachother, manipulating us, talking crap about eachother nonstop up until about two months ago. They couldn't be in the same room and had to have seperate family functions completely. It got to the point where my step dad had to drop us off at our weekly custody exchange spot because it was so bad. All the sudden they decided to start getting along. My dad came over to my older sister's graduation party at my mom's house and was bffs with my stepmother (who she hates) and now my dad and mom are regularly attending family functions drama free. What I came to reddit for today is it is absolutely freaking me out that they are getting along. I feel like I should be happy but they have hated eachother for 23 out of 25 years of my life. It's weird and I don't know how to handle it. The whole thing makes me really, really uncomfortable. Help? Suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}

Jake and I are both first year uni students. I'd say we're fairly close at this point - he had to go to the ER yesterday, and I spent most of the day with him (6 out of the 8 hours).\n\nI want to ask him out, but there are two things stopping me.\n\n1. I already came out once, and it wasn't a fun experience. I feel like, by asking a guy out (or anyone out, for that matter) I'm basically coming out again. People will talk, people will react badly, and I really don't want either of those things to happen. I feel like that's a bad reason to avoid asking someone out, but I can't shake that feeling.\n\n2. A guy he used to have a crush on (let's call him Eric) came back into the picture around a half an hour ago. Apparently, they both liked each other but thought the other wasn't interested. Eric just texted Jake and explained all that, and now they're going to meet up tomorrow and talk things through. \n\nEric wants a relationship with Jake, but Jake doesn't know if he still wants a relationship with Eric, so he asked all of his friends (me included) what to do. I told him that he should hear what Eric has to say and then do what he thinks is right. I want to ask him out, but I also don't want to add to his confusion.\n\nI should also mention that I'm completely oblivious when it comes to sex stuff; I've been on dates without realizing because the girl I was with didn't actually use the word \"date.\"\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by sleeping over at my girlfriend's new place. NSFW\nPOST: Didn't happen today, but couple of months ago in the summer (around August 2015). \n\nAround end of June of last year, my girlfriend and her roommate found a new apartment to move into since it was more spacious and convenient for her commute to work. Before she moved out, it was really difficult for us to have time alone with each other to have sex (I was living at home with my mom). Her new place is located just outside of NYC and has a newly furnished kitchen and bathroom. The only downsides I would say is that the place is a bit small and is near a construction area, but other than that, it's a really nice apartment. I was really ecstatic that she moved into this new place since it was also really close to my work.\n\nAnyways, after a couple of weeks when she finally settled in, I went over to her place during a week day and was able to get down and dirty with her. Probably after the 3rd or 4th round of sex, we both finally went to sleep in the nude.\n\nNow one thing you should know about me, I am pretty allergic to mosquito bites. Since this was the optimal time for mosquitoes to be around (and apparently they can breed near puddles of cement water in the construction area), they decided to have their way with me. The reason why it was such a f- up, they didn't just bite me on my arms and legs...they bit my privates and my eyelids. It got so extreme, my eye got swollen to the point where I looked like Matthew Broderick in that movie Election (when his eye gets stung by a bee) and my dick looked like a chode. Needless to say, I woke up at 3AM with about 20 mosquito bites and decided to leave her place to sleep at my work place.\nTL;DR:"}

This time, its dinner, and I specifically said 'can I take you out to [restaurant]' in my text - so it's definitely a date. \n\nOn our first date, she casually mentioned her favorite dessert was cheesecake. My question is, should I surprise her with cheesecake (since it won't be served at the restaurant we're going to); I would keep it in a cooler in my car during the date.\n\nSecond, should I sing her a song that I wrote on my guitar - kinda cheesy lyrics, but it's a pretty decent song.\n\nShe's religious and seems pretty conservative - as in, never smoked and never drank until she turned 21. She's also only been in 1 serious relationship before. Both these things really stunned me because based off her physical appearance, I would have thought that she would be a party girl/social butterfly and have had a lot of dating experience. \n\nDo you guys think that this is just too much, and will creep her out?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Had an argument with GF about our lacking sex life, found it it's because she was raped.\nPOST: I (26) have been dating my GF (26) for about 1 year 9 months. Our sex life was adequate, but never stellar. She was always close and intimate, but as soon as things got close to the bedroom, she would start to get timid. She has kind of hinted at sexual abuse in the past but never directly said anything. \n\nOur sex life has been dropping off quite a bit recently and it has been resulting in a significant strain in our relationship. We are perfect in every other facet of our relationship but this has been putting a lot of strain on it. I brought this up one night thinking it was due to stress from school/work. \n\nThings got pretty emotional and she ended up confiding in me that she was a rape survivor. She shut down pretty quickly, but I was able to get a little information from her. I am only the third person she has told about this, and I get the impression that this happened a long time (10+ years) ago by someone close to her (perhaps a relative). She told me that she wants to be more intimate, but is only able to with the aid of alcohol as a result of the past abuse.\n\nShe has expressed no desire to go to counseling or talk about this issue any further. I don't want to push her to do either if she isn't ready, but I want to let her know that I'm here if she wants to talk. I realize that things will take time for her to open up and fully trust me, but I'm afraid that things will continue to suffer until then. \n\nI know it's kind of selfish, but it's important to me to be able to communicate with each other and work through our relationship problems but it seems like this might end up being a wall that we can't get past. I don't know if I should try to bring it up again, push for counseling, or just let things be the way they are. I love her so much and it pains me to see her have to suffer alone.\nTL;DR:"}

Back when I was 8, my family was on vacation and I had a shingles outbreak. It never got to a terrible stage but we contacted our family physician (Dr. Herpina for our ease) and she gave temporary advice and instructions until we could get back in town. (Only a day or two later I believe). Once back in town, it was treated and I have never had problems with it since that time. It was 11 years ago so the details are a bit vague but I do know that Dr. Herpina was the only physician my family ever contacted about my shingles. \n\nFast Forward 11 years. This is where it gets interesting... I was home from school last weekend and my mom told me I had a message. I listened to it and was a bit puzzled. It was from a local research firm that was experimenting with shingles. They called and asked if I would be part of a study but I had to be going through an \"episode\". I respectfully declined, mostly cause I haven't had an \"episode\" since the original.\n\nBut here is my question... how the fuck did this research firm know I once had shingles?

I met this man while on vacation about a year ago. We did long distance for a while, then decided we had had enough. I moved to him out of ease. And I was looking for a new adventure anyhow.\n\nWe moved in pretty quickly. We are very much in love. But I just discovered a lie that I feel is pretty hard to overlook. His ex is his boss at work, which I hadn't had any real feelings for at all. I mean, it's not the coolest. But it isn't exactly easy for him either, so I figured I shouldn't cause a stink and make it worse. Plus, I get cool chick points for not caring. He told me that they had stopped banging over two years ago anyway.\n\nSo today, he left his gmail open on my computer. I figured it was mine and was confused about why it said I had been talking to his ex (who is now his boss and they're in close proximity) so much. Realized quickly that it wasn't mine, but not before I saw a subject line that was quite sexual, about a month after I met him. He was clearly searching all of their history for some reason (don't care). What I'm really upset about is that he lied about how long ago they'd stopped being intimate. It appears that he actually stopped (hopefully as I didn't read them or look at any other subject line) right before he and I got intimate.\n\nI don't care so much about the skipping from one girl to the next as I care about the lie. I absolutely will not bring this up to him, because I'm not a snooper and I don't want him to think I am. So, I guess the question is this: How do I absorb this in a healthy and rational way? I feel a little sick about the lie, I want to continue to trust him. And I want him to continue to trust me so much that leaving his gmail open on my computer wasn't even an issue. What do?

Your brain makes a connection that the man is talking about the bag of salt and therefore you understand every single word he is saying if you are exposed to this repeatedly).

Which is better: [Hilton Nordica] or the [Icelandair Marina Hotel] I'm having a huge dilemma. The Marina would be a little more expensive with the deal I'm doing, and there are some pretty mixed reviews on Google and TripAdvisor.

How reliable and easy to use is the bus system?** I have heard of the Reykjavik Welcome Card, and that seems like a very good deal ($25 USD for 72 hours.) However, it is a little iffy how useful this would be. Would the buses be a reliable (and now free) option to get us to a lot of points of interest? If they are, it might affect the hotel question above.\n\n**4. What are some good restaurants?** Both of my two hotel choices provide breakfast, and most of our tours involve lunch, but what dinner places would you recommend? I'm looking for something that we could walk to or get to by bus, and I am very adventurous with my eating. A scenic place that offers Puffin and/or Whale is ideal. \n\n**4. What other experiences do you reccomend?** I want to get as much done as I can. I know that 4-5 days is a short time, but that's a hard limit. Please don't lecture me on that.

He used to do this much more earlier on in our relationship, and he knows it bugs me to no fucking end, especially the pet-names thing. \n\nI would often say he's flirting with these women, but he tells me he's not. If he were flirting, he would want to have sex with them, and he doesn't. Their interactions are on a purely face-to-face basis. He never calls or texts them or goes out of his way to spend time with any of these women, so I understand his point. \n\nI think my insecurities stem from our time dating in college. We were together for about 5 months, at the end of which he cheated on me with another girl, and treated me pretty horribly. He admitted he was awful to me when we got back together, and haven't talked about it since. \n\nSo, if anyone has helpful hints, I would love to hear them. My husband doesn't deserve me being petty and shrewish, especially since he has made an effort to make me feel better by correcting be his behavior.\nTL;DR:"}

Help before I jump his bones and we break the conference table.\nPOST: Backstory: I've been with my company for a year. Almost 5 months ago we hired a new staff member and we became fast friends. I kept telling myself I shouldn't pursue him romantically because we're coworkers and I'd ruin our friendship and make things awkward, but as you can see from the title, he was thinking the same thing and now we're going for it. I swear even though I spend 9 hours a day at work with him, lunch breaks, and time on weekends, I cannot get enough of him. Never once has he even mildly annoyed me, and on top of everything I have going on right now, he has been nothing short of kind, supportive, patient, and amazing. I can't sing his praises enough and we are seriously two peas in a pod. \n\nI did consider that this may be different from our other past relationships though because he's never dated a white woman and I've never dated an Asian guy before. (I'm mostly white, only a quarter Korean). Neither of us cares about the racial difference, but I am wondering if any redditors have experience with Asian male/white female relationships. I ask because his parents are both Korean and live in Korea even though he grew up in the states. I'm just looking for anecdotal stories or any advice if you think there's anything specifically useful to know. Also if there's a different subreddit I should ask this to, please point me in that direction.\nTL;DR:"}

He's working around 55-72 hours a week. He insists all engineers are like this, but we have a small group of friends who are also engineers (mechanical, electrical, environmental), and their hours are nothing like this. He also insists that it won't always be like this, that work will slow down at some point. And when we have kids (which won't be until 5 or so years from now), he says he'll find a less demanding job.\n\nNow, I don't work a cushy <40 hours a week job, either.

I saw her at a party a month ago and asked her if she got in yet. She told me she did get in, but that she was probably going to turn it down. I was really confused, why would you turn down something you had been waiting for for so long? She made some excuse about her husband's job, and I didn't push it.\n\nA couple weeks later, I was out with Hannah, our friend Abigail, and a bunch of other people. Abigail is like a sister to me, we've known each other since we were 7 or 8. Abigail and Hannah have known each other for a while, but only started becoming friends about 2 years ago. I didn't really get a chance to talk to anyone until the end because I was busy running around setting up and running things. I did get to spend about a half hour just hanging out with Hannah and Abigail at the end though. As Hannah was leaving, someone came up to congratulate her on being pregnant! This was the first day she was telling people, and I was happy for her.\n\nLater I was talking to Abigail, and she told me Hannah told her about the conversation we had about her getting into her program. Apparently she's turning it down due to her pregnancy, but she didn't want to tell me that since she hadn't finished her first trimester yet. I totally understand this, but I don't understand why she went through the trouble to tell Abigail the entire conversation we had together, but didn't bother telling me she was pregnant herself? She had plenty of time to do it, and it's not like Abigail and Hannah are really close. Hannah and I are casual friends, so I don't expect her to go out of her way to tell me, but we have been friends much longer than Abigail and she have. I'm hurt that she went through the trouble of telling Abigail about our conversation, but didn't bother to take 10 seconds to tell me she was pregnant herself to finish off that conversation.\nTL;DR:"}

After this happened, I ended up moving across the country to be with my family. His mother ended up keeping most of his belongings, however I brought with me his robe as it was something he wore almost every day. It was comforting to have something of his with me during the grieving process. \n\nTwo years later, I'm now in a serious relationship again and we are moving in together shortly. While packing, I realized I still have my late boyfriend's robe in my closet and am worried that my current boyfriend, though understanding, might be concerned that I am still holding on to it. Even though my late boyfriend will always be special to me, I feel like it is time for me to let go of his robe. However, it almost feels cruel to give something that was so special to him away to Goodwill, as silly as that might sound. I feel obligated to ask his mother if she wants his robe back, seeing that she wanted to keep everything he owned, but I'm not sure if that would be rude or awkward to ask her that.

The guy in this broke up with me at the beginning of last year (after a 2 year relationship), and a lot of hate was stored up due to that - so much that when he got with the other girl in this story, I wanted nothing to do with them and said some pretty bad things about especially her (irrational, I know). Half a year down the line, I was able to establish a platonic friendship with the guy and chat with him (he'd been in my life when a lot was going on, and I didn't really want to lose him as a friend) much to the expense of his relationship (the girl had trust issues with it and things went downhill from there, not liking me in the process). \n\nNow things have settled down, those two have been 'seeing each other' again and I really don't want to get in the way of that. I'm happy in my own relationship and I don't want to make things awkward, but I know the guy said he wants to keep being friends with me and that his girl will have to deal with that, because there is nothing going on. I don't want to harbour this grudge against this girl anymore and I've considered making peace with her, but I'm not sure how to go about it/to bother at all.\n\nWhat would you do?

In the spring I started my behavioral duties. The director of behavior services had personal issues with the staff supervisor and program admin; she exacerbated a situation to make it seem like neglect and had them both fired. \n\nSHE'S since been fired after being investigated by QA. The assistant director quit because of ethical concerns with the agency. A staff of about 11 is now down to 5 leaving us severely under ratio. A staff was put in charge and abuses his power by making us work without lunches or breaks, and manipulates client to staff ratio so he doesn't have to do work. There's supposed to be 1 staff for every 3 consumers yet I'm alone in a room with up to 6 or 7. \n\nI emailed the executive director of the company politely complaining how I was not hired to be direct care and how I wasn't getting breaks. She replied saying that my behavioral duties are secondary to ratio and I'm expected to be direct care until we're staffed up. Since then she's fired two more staff leaving us MORE understaffed. \n\nALSO, there's been three instances when the company couldn't afford to pay us on payday and we had to wait until the following week for paychecks. I was also hired at 40k salaried and was switched to $20.50 hourly.

I got out of a 2.5 year relationship roughly 1 month ago. My ex just didn't have the feelings anymore. The breakup was not messy at all. But nevertheless, we are on no contact, since I think this is the best to move on. I am doing fine and I think I am ready to date again.\n\nThis was just some background info. \n\nThere is this girl in the same department in university, who I find cute. \n\nLast semester (back in december) I supervised an experiment for some students, and she was also part of it. Therefore I know her name and her email adress. But at that time I was in a relationship, so I did not ask her out or anything.\n\nWhen we meet on the hallway, we both smile and greet each other. I want to ask her out on a date, and think about the best way to do it. When I see her, she is usually with her friends.\n\nNow to my original question: Is it okay to write her an email and ask her out? I could also write her a message in Facebook (I am not friends with her there). I just don't know if this is too awkward and I should wait for an opportunity to approach her alone in the department at some time.\nTL;DR:"}

First couple dates were AMAZING, and I could definitely tell we were both into each other. Then we didn't see each other for about 2 weeks for various reasons. He texted me a few times in those 2 weeks, but nothing substantial. It was my birthday recently, and he got me a wonderful, thoughtful gift, took me out to a nice, expensive dinner, the works, etc. etc. But since then, no word from him. We said we would hang out tomorrow, and he still hasn't texted to plan anything.\n\nNow, I don't want to be needy or clingy. I'm totally fine being independent and not seeing him all the time.

We had started out just sleeping together but it became something more a few months ago. We have confessed that we loved each other and it has been pretty good since then. We would spend nearly every night together (we live about five minutes away from each other), and we would still cuddle and have sex often.\n\nHow I feel about him though... it feels really intense for me. Like, I'm kind of overwhelmed. I've never been in love like this with anyone before. I feel almost DEPRESSED when I'm not with him, and I don't want him to feel obligated to be with me all the time just to make me happy. It really is like he's my drug and I need him to be at full happiness. I'm feeling sort of emotionally unstable right now, which has never happened before and it's scaring me.\n\nI'm pushed to the point of tears right now, because I can't see him as often anymore. It's killing me, and it's only been a few days since I've seen him. I was thinking I might ask for a break from our relationship or try seeing a counselor at my university. We both have our own busy lives, so it's not like we can see each other all the time. What can I do to make myself happy without needing his physical presence?\nTL;DR:"}

I told her that the women here are \"hot and sexy\" and that its a huge challenge for a guy not to cheat down here. Of course I didn't actually mean it and I was being a dickhead and I acknowledged that, and after that happened we've just been arguing and I snapped, and I decided to tell her that we should go on a 10 day break until I come back home. I meant the break for us to have our own space and to stop fighting over nothing, but then she replied \"since you don't wanna deal with me we'll just end things now\", which I assume she was breaking up with me.\nI think she got the idea of a break as a message that I didn't care about her or didn't want to deal with her but thats not true.\n\nPlease give me advice because I'm afraid I'll do something I'll regret.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by breaking the toilet and flooding the bathroom\nPOST: After a long day of not doing much of anything, I walk into the upstairs bathroom to relieve myself. I realize that for some reason I'm holding my laptop, so as I sit down, without really thinking, I set it down behind me on top of the toilet. This particular toilet happens to have a fairly large space between it and the wall. This leaves some of the toilet tubes exposed, and leaves part of the laptop hanging over the edge of the toilet directly above them.\n\nAnyway, as I'm getting comfortable on my porcelain throne, I lean back just an inch or two. Herein lies my mistake. As I do so, I push against the laptop, and it falls into the space behind the toilet. Suddenly, I hear a sound like water rushing from a bathtub faucet coming from behind me. I jump off the toilet as water starts spewing from a fresh hole in the wall. I realize that when the laptop fell it must've broken one of the toilet tubes connecting to the wall, and I start to panic. There is water spraying everywhere. Gallons of it. I'm freaking out and I'm not really thinking, so I try to stuff the broken tube back into the wall, but obviously that doesn't work. I stand there like an idiot for a second, unsure of what to do until I finally come to my senses and run downstairs into the garage to shut off the water. Afterwards, I make my way back upstairs to survey the damage. My worst fears are realized when I see the bathroom. It's completely flooded with water, which is leaking into my nice carpeted room, and on top of all that it stinks of chemicals. So I throw down some towels to try to soak it up. Then I remember my laptop. I run back to the toilet and lift my laptop from the newly formed pond of toilet water, carrying it back into the safety of my room. I cross my fingers and hit the power button. By some miracle, it still works perfectly.\n\nI then spend about an hour and a half without water (which is harder than it sounds) waiting for the plumber to arrive.\nTL;DR:"}

I look back at my co-worker and to my horror he is full fledge masturbaiting to the picture, look back at my mom who has opend the door all the way, not saying a word just watching this take place. My co-worker then rolls over on top of me, pinning me down and proceeds to blow his load all over me.  At this point I was more angry than ever, screamed and threw a punch at him. Snap back to reality, we both wake up mid punch right as my fist makes contact with her face. Luckly I was able to pull back at the last second and just barely poke her eye. After realizing it was a dream I checked to make sure she was ok and apologized profusely. She said she was ok but was a little worried I might go Mohammed Ali on her again. We slept fine through the rest of the night and can now akwardly laugh about it.\nTL;DR:"}

Got to the school fine. Heading back home, I got completely turned around, texted my dad and got no response. Drove a few miles further, still couldn't find my way, so I stopped at an intersection and looked up directions on my phone. Car pulls up to my left, no one is behind me, so I motion for them to go ahead, as I'm still struggling to plot my way home. Still no one behind me, even after the car passes, but a police car was behind the first car, and I motioned for him to go ahead as well. \"Transit directions could not be found between these locations\" pops up on my screen. The cop still hasn't moved, so I call it quits and pass through the intersection, and he pulls me over for making a \"text-like motion\" at a stop sign. \n\nHere's what you have to understand. I drive like an old lady. I've never been in an accident, never gotten a ticket, but was pulled over once and given a warning about texting well over a year ago. So I don't text while I'm driving anymore. I wait until I stop. The cop who gave me the warning said, \"I know its a new law, so you may not have heard about it yet, just don't do it again.\" I agreed and went on my way. Now this happens and I have no idea how things are going to go at court tomorrow. I hate the idea of getting a ticket for something I honestly thought was legal, especially when I have nothing on my record. Not to mention the fine. Any suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}

Im wasnt really looking for a girlfriend but she is great. She is pretty, she is cool, she is interesting, and caring. The sex is great but most importantly we totally share the same values-OK I dont know her fully after 5 weeks but you know what I mean.I really like her, although Im concious that maybe I just like sex and attention, I need to get to know her more before I can really know how it is. Anyway, so why end it? Well she is 32 and has 2 young children. She knows that in 2 years once I finish Uni Ill be out of here. I want to travel the world and work overseas etc. And whilst she wants to too its not that easy for her for obvious reasons. The children see their Dad, she isnt looking for me to come and make dinner and tuck them up at night so its not a problem at the moment, It just seems inevitable that whatever happens, in a couple of years we wont be able to stay together. So Im sat here feeling like its crazy to end something thats going so good becasue of how things might be in a couple of years, but its also crazy to carry something on if it has no future.\nTL;DR:"}

I was working in a call centre, trying to stop people from cancelling their subscription TV service, but had been promoted into another department that was dealing with escalated complaints. So instead of answering calls, I was making them and sending emails, etc. One day I'm talking to a customer and trying to resolve their complaint. They were half of an older couple, 60ish. They didn't have a computer, but wanted some documents sent. For whatever reason, this person got very belligerent when I said I would post it to them, demanding that I fax it instead. Without saying what an abusive piece of shit they were, I agreed and went off to use the fax machine to send it to them. I walk into the little printing room, where we had a combination photocopier/printer/scanner/fax and start punching in the numbers to send this document. It doesn't work. I try again. Now, this is my first time using a fax, because I'm 23 and who the hell uses a fax? But I thought, how hard can it be? So I double check the fax number, put it in again, still doesn't work. After about six attempts I'm getting pretty annoyed and one of the managers comes over to use the machine. He asks me what the issue is. I explain that I'm trying to send this customer a fax, but the machine isn't working. Manager offers to try. He puts in the number, fax does the exact same thing. I make a loud noise, call the machine stupid and say see it didn't work! The manager looks at me confused and asks why I didn't think it worked, to which I respond, \"The paper came back out!\" The second I said it, i realised what a horrificly, ridiculously, moronic individual I am.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by writing a letter to a pen pal\nPOST: This happened in high school but I thought it was very appropriate to share here.\n\nIn Year 10, we had a new Japanese teacher and he was keen and excited to introduce new projects. One of them was to write letters to our sister school in Japan in Japanese, and then our pen pal could reply in English, as a way to practice. I was a bit of mischief maker and wanted to include a little joke in my letter (I obviously wasn't thinking too clearly at the time). I wrote in Japanese \"My current hobbies are building websites, if you wouldn't mind, please check out my newest website!\" and then inserted a link to goatse.cx.\n\nLittle did I know, that all the letters get checked first by the Japanese teacher. So he was in the staff room and tried to view 'my website' out of curiosity. Unfortunately the website was blocked, so then the Japanese teacher asked the principal to view it on her computer because her computer had all-access. I guess you guys can work out the rest.\n\nAfter the incident, I was forced to see the school counsellor twice a week for 4 weeks in which I had to convince him I didn't make the website. Luckily back then, people weren't as technologically savvy so I managed to convince the counsellor that my website was hacked.\n\nThat Japanese teacher became one of my closest mentors and I still meet up with him for drinks 15 years out of high school. We talked about this incident recently and he said he was never allowed to do the pen pal project ever again after that. I felt terrible :(\nTL;DR:"}

As you can imagine, I was devastated that she had lied to me and that we were not going to be together.\n\nShe briefly broke up with him to be me, and then went back with him. Since we attend the same school, whenever we saw each other, she would ignore me, etc. We went from being great friends, to almost being starngers over the course of one day.\n\nAfter 8 months of no-contact, she emails me apologizing for \"being brutal with me, ignoring me, and that it did not work out\".

She regularly rants to me about how other people tell her to raise her kids.. I hate to be that person! I believe the 4yo daughter (call her Jane) has an eating disorder. Jane is a bit of a \"black sheep\" and has a very dynamic and moody temperament. The older daughter, age 6, eats most things ok and never pitches a fit at the table.\n\nI hate doing meal times with them. \n\nFor example, saturday night was a big dinner with my sister, her 2 kids, my parents, and my daughter (age 2).\n\nJane did not eat a single bite of dinner besides biscuit. There was chicken + ketchup, mashed potatoes, corn, and biscuits. Grandmother insisted that I spoon-feed the kid. I didn't want to AT ALL. Grandmother had to plead, beg, and coerce, then threaten the kid to take maybe 6 tiny bites of chicken. And yes, Grandma spoon-fed every single bite. This is a typical family gathering event.\n\nShe eats bread, crackers, cookies, donuts. It is known that she pretty much will not eat any fruit or vegetable, besides maybe applesauce or french fries. I have regularly seen her take the minimum amount of food before darting from the table, leaving most of the remainder behind. She will not drink milk and only drinks water (if forced), OJ, or apple juice.\n\nI know some kids have \"phases\" but this has been getting progressively worse for 2 years.

A LOT. how she cheated on him with his friend, and he loved her so much, blah blah. and he is SO depressed about it. i can understand that hes still hurt because she was his 1st true love, and he got with me right away so there wasnt time to move on.\n\nbut. we had sex for the first time last week and now im just feeling meh about the whole thing. because i'm not really a super affectionate person and he was always telling me that its like were \"not even together\" and how i never want to hold him, kiss etc even tho we did sometimes.\n\nso we had sex and i kind of just went along with it but it was awkward, he immediately asked for a bj and i didnt want to do it so he went down on me and then i just kind of figured why not, and it wasnt that good. i was just laying there and not saying anything and he didnt notice so told him i was uncomfortable and i wanted to stop and he was like \"ok almost finished\" and then he finished. we kind of laughed about it afterwards but i felt gross about the whole thing. because he was my first? i regret it.\n\nanyways i havent hung out with him since then and i'm making up excuses not to. because of the whole ex thing and now the sex. is this a normal way to feel? or should i just dump him?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Wife has back problem, looking for advice for recovery\nPOST: My wife has been suffering a back issue for 2 years now.  She originally injured it while, of all things, driving over a speed bump at low speed.  Following the initial injury she began to experience numbness in her legs and feet and a strange \"unstable\" sensation in her lower back.  Luckily she hasn't experienced much pain at all, mostly just the numbness and weak feelings.\n\nAfter seeing a physiotherapist, chiropractor, and other doctors, she finally had an MRI that confirmed two bulging discs in her low back.  Since then she has been seeing a kinesiologist regularly in order to do exercises to help strengthen her core muscles to hopefully allow her body to heal itself properly.\n\nWell, she's been going through this therapy for a long time now (probably a year and a half) and hasn't improved to the point where she can put her own pants on.  She continues to complain about feeling \"crooked\" and explains it as half of her back is pulling down and the other half is pulling up, making her hips misaligned.  After some research she found that there's a condition called [sacroiliac joint dysfunction] which could be, in our opinion, the cause of many of the issues she's having.  Her doctors seem to continue to only want to deal with her bulging disc issues and not her joint problem, however.\n\nMy question is, is there anyone out there that has recovered from an SI joint problem and how did you do it?  How long does it take?  Are there any precautions we should take?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm finally really enjoying being single but not so much enjoying the lack of action. I have never had one before I think a fwb/casual relationship would be awesome right now. \n\nTrouble is, I am paranoid about catching an STI but in particular herpes because 1. Many don't know they have it 2. It can easily be caught even with condoms 3. It is incurable. \n\nI think I am more afraid of the stigma of having it than the condition itself. I fear that catching it will make it really, really hard to find a relationship later on. \n\nI've been browsing on a dating app and have found someone I'm attracted to that might be a great fit for what I'm looking for right now, but I'm not sure how to handle my fear or mitigate my risk other than asking them if they have anything/have been tested. Would it be insane to ask a potential fwb to get a blood test? Where I'm from the blood tests for herpes are not even done as part of regular screening. Should I insist on no genital contact unless a condom or underwear is between us? People have casual sex all the time.... am I being too paranoid here?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.

We decided to have it checked out and an x-ray showed that it was indeed a tumor, but didn't look cancerous. They wanted to do a biopsy anyway.

However, some things he does drive me absolutely insane and I can't tell anymore if it's just his personality or if something else is going on.\n\nThis all came to a head yesterday. Someone in his family recently gave birth and we talked about going to visit. I said I wasn't sure if I could go but will keep him posted throughout the day. 3 p.m rolls around and I msg him saying, \"hey when are we leaving, what are we bringing etc\". He responds and then says, \"oh btw James is coming lol\".\n\nFirst I was confused and then I was really pissed off. James is his best friend of 10 years. I have no problems with any of his friends but (and we've had this fight before) whenever it is the 3 of us hanging out my boyfriend will show 0 affection. We can't hold hands, can't peck, can't snuggle for too long or even have inside jokes. He says he feels bad because James has never had a girlfriend and has really low self esteem so he doesn't want to rub our relationship in his face. We argued for a bit but he wasn't getting why I so upset so I just stopped responding.\n\nTo keep this story short, I didn't end up going to see the baby because I feel like we keep having the same argument that is centred around my boyfriend not treating me differently than his friends (if that makes sense). I just feel like there are some \"life milestones\" or whatever that you should share with your partner and those things should be special. \n\nI guess my question is, would anyone else be upset?\nTL;DR:"}

She said we may get back together in the future (who knows) but we will definitely date others before that ever happens again.  What bothers me, is that I think I know who it will be with, and this same guy is someone she kissed while we were broken up for a few weeks.  Don't get me wrong, I kissed people while we were broken up, at parties and such also.  The part that bothers me, is that she lied to me about kissing this guy for the longest time, and now I feel like she wants him now too.

Just him, me, and my two supervisors.

It truly is for the best that we aren't together anymore.\n\nI'm engaged to someone who is in every way better for me. Same sense of humor, similar taste in movies and TV, big concert-goer, same religion, etc. I couldn't have imagined a better person for me.\n\nThe problem is, even though it's been years, I can't help but get those same nostalgic feelings when I see my ex's name pop up in mutual friends' FB posts or find a gift she gave me years ago. I know that logically, I have no reason to have any feeling at all about her, since we were incompatible and I'm much happier with someone else, but my emotions just aren't keeping up.

My credit is poor because I am young and uninsured, and I had to have an emergency surgery last year and defaulted on a couple payments. I have all the small defaulted bills payed off, but have one still sitting there that is about $1500. I *could* use my savings to pay that off and hopefully get my credit rebuilt more quickly, but then that's a huge chunk of my savings gone. Would getting rid of that last payment be worth it?

We find out the next morning that many things are missing and come to the conclusion that it was a burglary because the front door was open (we are pretty methodical about closing and locking). Among the things that go missing are an iphone, computer, camera, gameboy color (my heart!) and my wallet. \n\nWe call the police and an officer stops by and takes our statement and  says that he'll be looking into it, but with little information we're not hopeful. Then something wonderful happens.\n\nThe thief decides to pay his cell phone bill with my bank card. I notice it on my bank statement, and call the bank to put a stop on the card. The online bank statement provides a phone number and the area for which the phone is registered, so I call them to see if I can get any additional information on this thief. They are only able to give me the last 4 digits of the number but knowing the area code we look up all the possible numbers it could be and start calling. There's about 53 numbers in total but literally all of them but one are either old people or families. \n\nWe google this number and get squat, so we hop over to craig's list thinking this guy may be trying to sell our stuff there. He's not but the number is listed for a contact from a sale 3 months prior, and here's the kicker its for a car that was sold out front of our house. We call the number and get a voicemail and realize from the name given that it's our 16 year old neighbor...\n\nI then call the phone company to see if they can verify that the number we found is the number on the statement that used my bank card. It is. We call the police let them know all this information, but after several days it still seems like this kid won't actually end up being arrested.\n\nReddit is there anything I can do to try and get our stuff back or anything I should do in case the police don't end up arresting him? Any help would be much appreciated. My family and I are just very frustrated right now.\nTL;DR:"}

I comfort eat a lot. I'm in my early 20s and had a horrible childhood with no parents or siblings for comfort, but food was always there. It's comforted me my whole life and my weight has fluctuated like crazy. My heaviest ever weight is 70kg of pure fat on a 5ft 7 frame, and my lowest has been around 50 kg. I either turn to or reject food depending on the situation. Right now is a highly stressful time in my life, I failed this semester of college and only have 3 weeks until the retakes of ridiculously difficult courses. My stress levels through the roof.

The lows give me really bad brain fog which in turn makes me turn to more sugar. So I guess the point of this post is that I'm going through a lonely and stressful time and food is the only thing that comforts me, but I don't want to end these 3 weeks on the brink of death and physically ruined, and I know my poor nutrition also affects my ability to fully concentrate on my studies too.

I'm not at all experienced with relationships. In fact, this relationship is my first serious one ever, so I'm really having trouble figuring out if what I'm feeling is normal and sensible or not. I have no prior experience to use as a baseline for any of this. I'll just get into what's happening now I guess.\n\nFrom the start, this has felt like a very good relationship to me. She really seems to appreciate me and enjoy being around me, and I was not used to that. Even still, whenever I get to see her, I get the feeling that I could just walk around the park with her forever and I'd be happy with that. In person, she is very affectionate and fun and just pleasant to be around. \n\nThe issue is that when we're apart (which is pretty often because she lives half an hour away from me and neither of us has a car) I get so down on our relationship. I start to feel like she doesn't appreciate me nearly as much as I do her, and I get so worried that she's going to realize she could do better than me (which she could) and just leave me alone.\n\nIt probably doesn't help that when we're texting I'm always the one who has to start a conversation. She'll never text me unless I text her first, and pretty often it's her who ends the conversations too.\n\nAnother thing that's contributing to my worry is that a good portion of my friends who know her really dislike her. I think this comes from a big fight she had recently with one of her best friends that resulted in them cutting ties.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: I'm not happy with my my job, can I get some outside prospective?\nPOST: Hello! I'm in need of some advice! I started this job about a year ago thinking it would be a nice place to work while I was working on my degree. It was great at first, just simple data entry and scheduling stuff, but then my coworkers started to quit. It's a really small company, so every loss is felt through out the entire staff. \n\nAnyway, as time went on my manager piled more and more responsibilities on my shoulders. It's really not hard, but those projects combined with the busy phone work combined with the low staff makes things really stressful. So stressful that I'm beginning to lose sleep over this or that because I'm not sure if it was done correctly and no one wants to help. There's also some legal ramifications that ride on some of the things I do, so everything needs to be done perfectly which equals more pressure! I didn't even bother to sign up for classes this semester because of the staff shortage and my stress levels. \n\nSo basically I've come to absolutely hate this job. I hate the hours, the people I work with are petty and don't listen/do their jobs, I'm blamed for things that are out of my control, and I dread going in everyday. I want to quit and go to school full time. However, I feel like I can't just up and quit because they would be even more short staffed. I know it's not my problem, but...I would just feel incredibly guilty. \n\nI know all of this sounds super lame, and I think I already know the answer, but I really need some outside prospective on this one. I should quit and do what makes me happy because life is short and I shouldn't waste it doing something I hate, but then again they kind of need me at this job. Have any of you been through something similar? What did you do?\n\nThank you for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

I live with my GF and pay her bills.\nPOST: Both in our mid-20s.Have been dating my GF for 3.3 years. We were talking about me claiming  her on my taxes, since one of our friends does it and I looked into it, and we meet all of the qualifications. Plus it was my GF's idea. \n\nAlso, I pay 100% of rent, and utilities. My GF pays for some things here and there. And her mother lives across the entire country and she hasn't lived there in a long time.\n\n1 day before submitting my taxes I hear that her mother claimed her/my GF, and was sending down a couple hundred dollars $150 and that she got their taxes back. (She received WAY more than just a few hundred...)\n\nThis seems so stupid, but at the same time, I don't make that much money, my GF is still in school for another year. My GF hasn't lived with her parents in the longest time, and clearly aren't paying our bills. \n\nWhy does this annoy me so much? Her mother, sending down a couple hundred, thinks she's being \"sweet\" when in reality it's not 100% of the amount. I find it slightly tacky. But then again, I feel shitty just posting this, but feel like the mother didn't have much of a right. My GF and I really watch our pennies, and it really could've helped.\nTL;DR:"}

She is a pretty jealous person in my opinion i think because her other boyfriends had left her for someone else. \n\nNow, unfortunately my ex is part enough of one of my friend groups that she gets invited to some of the same parties as me.

My dad died in 2013 but that's not the point. Anyways, my mom started dating this guy in 2011. We'll call him J [30-something/M].\n\nFirst of all, I've never been fond of J. My dad didn't like J so I, being close to my dad, didn't like him either. Still haven't in the 5 years I've known him. J has two kids of his own [13/F and 10/M] that I never really liked either. Like my mom, J has also had a divorce.\nI've never told my mom that I dislike J. I think she knows I don't but I don't admit it. They are engaged; I'm not exactly pleased. \n\nEnough with the backstory, onto the real problem. The last few years, they have been having sex quite a bit. I mean, I guess I can understand as my mom had a vasectomy so she can no longer get pregnant. Obviously. This wouldn't be a problem but I hear it more often than I want. What makes matters worse is we all moved in together earlier this year (much to my dismay) and my room is RIGHT below theres. The only other room left is the guest room on the same floor as them. I'll pass. \n\nThe bed squeaks REALLY bad and I can hear it. Sometimes even when I crank music up, I can hear it. They've done it numerous times whenever I've had my friend over and even when J had his kids over. Their wall shares a wall with the eldest's room. The fact that the youngest knew what they were doing even from age 6 makes this worse. I'm getting sick of this. I'm always home and I don't know if they know I can hear it or they are just stupid. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't stand this anymore. I wanna talk to her before I blow up on her.

Then I got a bit drunk today and felt a little sad so I decided to check my ex's blog which I thought was inactive after she broke up with me. I just though I could go through and read some of her old posts about her and i to feel better but instead I found a post from yesterday. It basically stated how I was 'too nice' and how she had amazing sex with rough hair pulling and was so happy to be free of me. This just hit me hard as I tried to have rough hair pulling sex once and she stated she only wanted to go slow and that 'scared her'. She was also the one that wanted to stay together for so long. Basically it stated everything was my fault and I didn't know how to cope with that. Also she is suddenly a 'heart breaker' which she criticized me for being in highschool. It just seems like she turned 180 in literally everything. I don't know how to cope now and all I could think of was drowning myself in dissarno. All I can say is thanks to my roommates who have supported me and hid all of my booze. I need a better way to cope and would like to know how\nTL;DR:"}

She is a wonderful dog, if a little energetic, and I train with her (almost) every day and I take her out for vigorous exercise daily.  About a month ago, I started dating someone and my dog's behavior has been much worse.  When my girlfriend is at my place, my dog is incredibly demanding about getting attention: nudging hands, jumping, barking, nipping, etc.  This happens even after she has been exercised, trained, and fed.  I don't want to reward the behavior by giving her attention, but it can be forceful to the point where it can't be ignored.  I have tried to redirect her energy to toys/food puzzles, but that only keeps her occupied for a short time then she is right back at it.  I have also tried getting her to obey a command (lie down) and wait for her to comply before we both give her attention.  The interesting thing is that if it were just me (or just my girlfriend) she is really calm and won't demand attention.  Something about the two of us seems to really get to her.

I am very new to dating (started when i was 22) and i had a very bad experience a year ago. After this experience i have no desire to date, do not find myself attracted to anyone and am not interested in getting to know anyone. I usually would only start talking to people that i've known for a while, and for the first time in my life i don't have a crush or anyone of interest. It's a strange, apathetic feeling. I haven't had sex in a year as well.\n\nOn top of this, i have 3 people in my life that i consider life long friends. Two of these people moved to Vegas (I live in PA), and the other has a boyfriend. The girl with the boyfriend basically lives with him and i hardly ever see her one on one. I'm lucky to see her once a week sometimes, she's very consumed with him. I barely even talk to her anymore. It's annoying and it hurts my feelings but I can't get mad since she had once accused me of doing the same thing when I had a boyfriend. \n\nSo basically to cope with being alone all the time, i started going to bars alone and drinking more just to be out of the house and interact with people. I found this to be an unhealthy habit and started staying in,  but being home alone all the time makes the loneliness suffocating. The anxiety and depression that goes with this makes me stay up late, sleep in late, and feel lethargic and sickly throughout the day. I'm starting up healthy habits like going to the gym and trying to make the most of my days but nothing beats this gaping hole in my chest.\nTL;DR:"}

Basically, freshman year of high school I was absolutely obsessed with this one girl that I had been friends with for quite some time. However, the more that time passed, the less I liked her. She would shut me out and often make up absurd excuses for mundane things. She also got really weird and, for lack of a better term, sort of like a stoner that thinks she's a stoner hippie but is too religious and timid to even touch anything that's impure. I outgrew her and I became an almost completely different and better person in the process.\n\nIt's been a few years now, and we still go to school together. I have been talking to girls who I find to be much more attractive and much more personable. But for whatever reason, there's this little piece of me that won't let go to the girl I obsessed over. Reddit, can you teach me the ways of cutting ties?\nTL;DR:"}

When she let him in he proceeded to rape and beat her and then tried to choke out her husband. The man is schizophrenic and was on medication but has stopped taking them. He has been walking over to my neighbors house and talking to her and her daughters so she called the police and that is how she found out about his history. The police has been coming around for the past 2 weeks checking up on him.\n\nMy wife is a stay at home mom and we have 3 preschool aged daughters that are home with her all day. Needless to say she is an emotional wreck and no longer feels safe in our home. I am totally distraught as well and feel helpless as to what I can do to protect my family and make them feel safe and secure again.\n\nI called the police and they weren't able to give me information because of the laws protecting peoples privacy in Canada. I will be going down to the police station to get some advice later today.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation that might have some advice?

I'm 100% sure I'm gay, and have been with a bunch of guys. I met this girl in high school around 4 years ago, and we've been extremely close friends ever since. Nothing remotely sexual ever happened between us because I honestly was very uninterested.\n\nI was very happy with the way our friendship was going, we talked a lot, texted a lot, hung out almost at least once a week since we met, but nothing sexual at all. Keep in mind she has no idea I'm gay, no one does. Lately, I've been having weird thoughts about her. I've never felt like this towards any other girl in my life ever before, It's not the crazy blinding sexual attraction I feel for guys, but I'm definitely attracted to her, and I'm very much in love. I can easily see myself giving up the idea of being gay (and all of its fun and pleasure) to be with her and to make her happy.\n\nI get very jealous when I sense a guy flirting with her, and I think she's starting to sense it. A lot of our mutual friends know that there's some tension between us, and I've been asked a lot by many people if there's anything going on between us.\nI'm relatively attractive, have no problems attracting guys at all, and so is she. It's crazy how much we think alike, and how close we've become without having anything sexual. I'm really confused as to why I'm having all these feelings, and I don't really know what to do. She's the most wonderful person I've ever known, and I have so many conflicting thoughts going on in my head, nothing is clear and I'm completely lost.\n\nWhy do I feel the way I do towards her? Why can't I just learn how to be straight and live my life being happy with her?\nTL;DR:"}

She's asked me about my culture a few times and I've told her about how I wasn't allowed to have a girlfriend when younger. She asked me how I dealt with all the restrictions and I just chuckled and said \"what my parents don't know doesn't hurt them\". \n\nThe truth is though is that I basically have no dating history. She's the first women I've ever kissed or had sex with. She's the first woman to ever accept my offer for a date (which surprised me since she's ridiculously attractive). \n\nSo I guess I'm just wondering, should I come clean? Or do I keep going with the flow the way I have? Does anyone think this is lying or just some acceptable white lie that we all tell in relationships? \n\nThere are other things about my youth that she doesn't know, for ex about me sitting alone at lunch, being bullied, and not going to my first party or drinking beer till I was 21, or the fact that my father was abusive.

Yet she has managed to make me feel ways that no one else in my life has, we are similar enough that we get along but different enough that we push each others boundaries, and challenge ourselves to be our best. We spend a great deal of time together and three days without seeing each other is rather uncommon.\n\nI know I love her, I have this dumbstricken happiness about her, and see a great future with her, and I want to tell her so badly that sometimes I feel it's going to come bursting out. The problem however is that she hasn't been here before, she's a no sex before marriage kind of girl, I'm her first boyfriend, (possibly her first kiss), and beyond kissing nothing else has transpired in the relationship (yup not even making out).\n\nI fear that just based on who she is that \"I love you\" may be an astronomical deal for her something that she could over think to death.\n\nThings have been going well in our relationship, I think it's safe to say we are moving forward, she is close she involves me with her friends and family, she even stayed over for the first time this past week as we are going away next month for the weekend and she was feeling uneasy about spending the night alone together so I suggested we have a sleep over where there weren't any expectations except for some damn awesome cuddling.\n\nI'm head over heels for her and want to proclaim it to the world, I've tried to test the waters, but I'm really not sure what to look for, what to expect and if I should just dive in!

It turns out that she started dating a guy that she was friends with while me and her were dating. This guy is 3 years older than us. He is a creep. He goes for younger girls because he can't get any other girl his age because they all know how much of a creep he is. I don't know what to do. They've been dating now for about a month and a half.

Some issues I can and I'm going to get a little more of a handle on them so I can be in control as much as possible. \n\nWhere am I going? Here. I have been seeing my boyfriend for nine months and he is the most understanding, helpful, kind, caring man I have ever had come into my life. I feel so fortunate and I make sure to tell him but I just wanted to tell Reddit so that he really knows (he has an account and knows my username) and I can again, speak of how grateful I am. \n\nThrough so much that I've already gone through, in the nine months we've been together, he has made me feel loved and that he loves me for who I am, regardless of what health issues I'm going through. I never thought I would find real love but this proves to me that I was incorrect in that thinking. I found someone wonderful and I hope that I can be the same understanding person to him, that he is to me. \n\nThat's all.\nTL;DR:"}

For months she has been scratching on the doors and windows. It's REALLY annoying. She only does it at like 2-5am and it wakes us up. She's isn't spayed yet and I know that's probably why, but we can't get her spayed right now. I was just wondering if there is any other way to break her of this OBNOXIOUS habit. Right now we've started to put her in her cat carrier at night. She claws to get out of that but not when I have it next to me on the bed while I sleep.\nTL;DR:"}

(X-post from r/askreddit\nPOST: I'm in highschool and I asked advice of a couple girls who I thought were friends, turns out two were two weren't. What I said to them was basically, I think I'm going to break up with my boyfriend because I want really having feelings for him anymore and I liked another guy who was also on our bus. I had to tell them because earlier that year he had a crush on girl #2 so I wanted to make sure that was over. They said it was adorable and # 1 and # 2 would be my wingmen. That was on a Tuesday. That friday I saw #1 and the guy holding hands. I didn't really know what to think so I shook it off, though i had a sneaking suspicion that they were talking about me. Later that night #2 texted me and said \"sorry you had to see that, guy and # 1 kissing\"  \nshe told me that #1 had a crush on him too and just didn't tell me because she felt bad because I was going to break up with my boyfriend. Again I was upset, but i shook it off because I wanted to stay friends with these girls. I thought it was a nice move that #1 appologised and said how both she and #1 felt bad.\nUntil today I was mostly over it and him until girl # 3 who has been really good friends with me since we were 2 told me that the guy and #1 never really kissed, they were just messing with me, because they told him and thought it would be funny.\nTL;DR:"}

How did you find out what happened on 9/11?\nPOST: I've grown up and lived in the suburbs of NYC for my whole life (19 now). One morning in 3rd grade (age 8), my teacher began to go over the Pledge of Allegiance with us to help us understand what it meant. Just as we got to, \"One nation, under God, indivisible...\", a secretary walked into our classroom, whispered something to the teacher, and asked us if we had parents that worked in the city. My dad did (no, he wasn't harmed but saw the whole thing unfold from his place of work) so I raised my hand.\n\nAs the day went on, more and more kids were being called down for dismissal. We all started to notice the trend and were confused as to what was going on. Just as I realized that all of the kids who were being called down had parents who worked in the city, I myself was called down.\n\nMy mom, a school teacher in a much closer suburb, was waiting for me in the office, completely composed, and walked me out to our car and explained to me that two planes hit the Twin Towers and that my dad and aunt (who lived in the city) were ok. I didn't understand the magnitude of what happened until much later, but all I knew was Nick was the only channel that wasn't talking about this. I watched cartoons until my parents began to explain to me that this was an attack, not an accident.\nTL;DR:"}

She introduced us to her best friend about a year ago, and I could tell she was into me, but I wasn't really feeling it. Even though this girl is always hanging around, it hasn't become a problem until lately, when she decides to go out with us on the weekends. I get drunk, and shes always at my side. I hooked up with her a few nights, but still it wasn't much of a problem, because its not like we ever talk that much. But lately I almost feel like I'm being taken advantage of, although I'm sure the women of reddit will tell me this is all my fault, and it probably is. She doesn't talk to me really when I'm sober, which I'm fine with, but as soon as I'm drunk she's all over me, and won't leave me alone. It also doesn't help that she's a varsity athlete with a rocking body, and actually a really sweet girl. But we get drunk, and then she just assumes shes staying at my place when we go out, and I can't always find a way out, and we have sex. And now, understandably, shes getting really clingy. She wants to make dinner for me tonight so I'm hiding in the library all night so I have an excuse not to be home. The only way I've found around all this is to literally run away to my other friends apartment when shes around and sleep there on their couch (cowards way out, I know). She doesn't seem to be getting the hints, and now I feel like an asshole, what do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

How do I not mess this up?\nPOST: **Backstory:** About 10-11 months ago, I broke up with my GF of 1.5 years. Heart broken, I turned to Tinder to keep my mind off of it. About 8 months ago, I matched with a girl who we'll call Carol. We hit it off pretty well,, but unfortunately she was 85 km (50 miles) away. Due to the distance, and having met another girl, I told her that I was deleting the tinder app, but to get in touch if she ever found herself in my area (I left her my full name).\n\n**Now:** I recently reacquired tinder, and I was delighted to see that she did not unmatch me. I thought about her more than once in the 8 months we did not talk, and I was sincerely hoping I would get the chance to talk to her again. So, with nothing to lose, I struck up a conversation, and managed to talk to her enough to get her Facebook info.\n\n**The Problem:** I don't know what I'm doing, and it seems to me that she is going along with my conversations out of politeness, and not actively pursuing conversation with me. Of course, I don't expect her to suddenly fall into my arms, but I'd like to have an earnest shot at courting this girl. I have been actively pursuing conversation with her for 4-5 days, having messaged her 3 times.\n\nHow do I maximise my chances with this girl, despite the distance? If she doesn't seem to be adding anything substantial to our conversations when we talk, should I start letting her strike up conversations with me (if she does at all)? Any advice on what I can talk about with her, and how often I should try talking to her?\nTL;DR:"}

I came home from work on Friday and asked to start the skype date now and then he tells me he has plans with his flat mates and barely messages me. At first I wasn't upset and said okay and then he went out for a party the following day and again I didn't get upset. I wished him a good night. Sunday came and he suggested to skype date but I turned him down and said from the beggining Friday is the only day I can do because of the time difference (6 hours). The reason is that I am more happy on the Friday (something to look forward to) but saturday/sunday I sleep until maybe 11-12 and by that time he is already eating or has other plans. \n\nHe says I am being difficult and refuse to work around any problems we have but the thing is the not wanting to Skype on Sunday is because I am in my comfort zone and I don't have the energy to wake up and look glam up for a date (idk if that makes sense to you guys). Then the fight got deeper yesterday and I wanted him to just realize that I got upset over something that important to me but he continues to say negative things like I haven't changed for the better nor am I being reasonable for the relationship to work. I feel like he isn't putting the much needed efforts for a LDR to actually work and he also hasn't seen that I have changed (getting upset over tiny things).\nTL;DR:"}

Lurked here before, never posted, the usual :) Sorry for formatting, I'm on my phone. And thanks for reading this.\n\nI have been dating my boyfriend for six months now. It's mostly been great: I didn't think we would work this well in the beginning because we deal with emotion so differently. He doesn't talk about it, I do, and he also doesn't really know how to deal with it. But he's been opening up and the communication is the best I've ever had in a relationship.\n\nHere's the issue. I have had bouts of depression since my teenage years. I told him that at the beginning because I want my boyfriends to know that there is a possibility of it coming back. I don't think he expected it to return, but it did.\n\nHe doesn't know how to help me. He holds me, tries to tell me it'll be okay, but he's also super honest about things and finds it hard to talk about feelings. So he'll never say \"you'll be okay, you're amazing, don't feel so bad about yourself,\" which sometimes I just want to hear when I feel like I'm the worst person ever.\n\nI'm noticing it's taking a toll on him. I'm on medication but it's still a struggle. My question is how do I make it easier for him? How can I keep the relationship fun and alive? Are there things he can do to help me? I find it so hard to tell him what I want him to do. I often end up just telling him to end it with me because I obviously can't make him happy. But he doesn't want to do that. What do I do? I just want to make him happy. Is there also a way I can show my appreciation for what he does? A lot of questions, but I'm also quite confused :)\nTL;DR:"}

If this isn't the right sub, let me know. \nAnyways, I love my girlfriend and she loves me. Everything is great, we spend every night together alternating between houses and plan to move in together once our leases are up in July. However, recently we've started arguing over what seems to be real simple things. Take tonight for example. She starts her period next week so we had planned to have sex tonight since I actually have a night off from work (long hours coupled with long drive). We get home from a small get together with friends and I start to undress her. We're both into it, but she has a routine before that has to be adhered to. Lights off, Pandora playing to cover for roommates, and get in bed. After all that I wasn't as turned on, I think because I like the spontaneity of it rather than planning out when and how we're going to have sex. She also expects me to initiate it every time by her laying down and me... Getting things warmed up. I would like some times to be different I guess rather than the same old starting. I don't feel like I can tell her this either because anytime I breach a serious topic with her she gets defensive and says I'm blaming her while she says it's my fault. Any tips? And I'll try clearing up any confusion I might have had, I'm not the best at describing things first go around.\nTL;DR:"}

So maybe it is just pathetic old me. But I made a very close friend in 5th grade and we remained friends throughout high school. I doubt if I was ever her best friend as much as she was mine (she was more outgoing), but we understood each other deeply and confided in each other.  \n\nAfter graduation, she went into the military across the country. We emailed each other about 5 times over a year and a half, but then she stopped.  Since she was the closest person to me I felt devastated. But I wasn't going to go begging for love that someone didn't want to give on their own accord.\n\nA long time later, maybe 2 and a half years, I decided to \"try\"her again, and sent her a friend request on Fb. She accepted, but didn't say anything to me.  So I was, and still am, left hanging and feeling betrayed yet again. (she still lives across the country)\n\nSometimes I wonder if I even should feel betrayed. Is it that our friendship doesn't seem like such a big deal to her anymore--i.e., does she just not understand? I know that the military can be a life-changing experience and that you can easily adopt a huge circle of very close friends (although she was never in combat), but does that mean you can be excused for leaving a childhood friend in the cold? As if nothing ever happened?\n\nIs it something I did? I used to have some overly-strict religious beliefs (indoctrinated from an early age) which caused me to criticize her sometimes (very gently) out of a (misguided) concern for her. I know that my last email to her had something like that in it.  It was a terrible thing for me to go through myself--and I don't blame myself for it, but perhaps it also offended her enough (though she never revealed any offense before) to never speak to me again.\n\n---\nShould I feel betrayed?\nTL;DR:"}

But other than this, really, our relationship is amazing. This is the one thing that makes me unhappy. And I didn't want to be the guy who broke up with his girlfriend because he was the jealous type.

Now, it's nothing bad. It's all hobby-related but... damnit, I thought when she said she would move forward with what I had expressed as discomfort in mind she would stop.\n\nSo I don't know what to do. It makes me very uncomfortable, she insisted it is nothing and he's just a family/lifelong friend, she said she would keep our conversation in mind but it didn't seem to change anything.\n\nI know she loves me and wouldn't do anything, but she also knows this relationship makes me unhappy but won't stop.

I was a bright-eyed 2L, a second-year law student eager to gun for the grade and act all smarty-smart. Looking back, I was kinda lame, but that is not this story.\n\nTo get a head up on your other classmates, students were encouraged to organize mini-lectures on points of law in the large lecture hall. This hall was organized theater-style, with tiered rows of tables stretching from front to back. It could seat somewhere around 500 people.\n\nOne particular \"lecture\" was being conducted by another 2L on a relatively minor and insignificant point of law. For some reason, though, a lot of students, including a whole slate of professors, decided to attend this particular presentation. The gentleman leading the lecture waited for quiet and calm. He was one of those insufferable, entitled, obviously Republican white men who share only one trait with hipsters--undeserved arrogance.  In short, he was a douchenugget.  As quiet spread, our hero stated that the presentation would begin with a video. Now, I don't know if you all remember this, but QuickTime would open to the point of the video that you last watched. So, as soon as that fateful second-click was completed, all 500 of us (students and professors, and I think a dog too) were treated to a still scene. of a giant black cock. ramming some poor white girl in the ass. projected onto an 8: x 6\" screen. Utter silence as the ramifications sunk in. Clearly, our hero had finished his \"gentleman time\" at some point just subsequent to the scene laid out in front of us. He never lived it down.\nTL;DR:"}

It's the happiest relationship of my life and she's my best friend, but I feel as if I've become more domesticated and have been missing out on that thrill of living alone/with roommates. Hell, we're even still independent, I just feel slightly tamed and it makes me wonder if I'm missing something. \n\nThat said, I'm pretty much sure I'm in the wrong for feeling I need the space because my behaviors before were kind of reckless. Even at 23, drinking too much, partying too much, and sometimes driving home after. I was making bad choices and she's kept me level. I know I'm wrong for it, but I miss being an alcoholic, carefree crazy. No clue what to do. I shouldn't let myself slip back into that, but I see everyone else having fun and going out to bars and getting wild while I'm out to do the same once a month on average.\nTL;DR:"}

Should I be worried?\nPOST: Created an account for this, so please let me know if I made any formatting errors etc.\n\nMy boyfriend and I met in a band, hence the age difference. We've been together for 2 years now. His first ex cheated on him with a couple of his friends so whenever I ask him about her he gets very upset. Then a week ago I found some racy photos of that ex hidden in the back of his drawers. I can't help but wonder why he would still have a CD with naked photos of her if he hated her so much. I was upset all day and I told him I was feeling upset because I found some nasty secret that he's been hiding from me. He then said \"the drawers?\" but later told me that he cannot even remember what was in that CD and it was so long ago. But he moved to the current apartment 1.5 years ago, so he must have placed it there then. When I asked him to explain this he said that to mention this ex is like mentioning the rapist to a rape victim. Because she has hurt her so bad that every time her name is mentioned he gets really angry. He then said he didn't delete them because at that time he was so mad that he wanted to post her naked photos online for revenge, but later decided that she's not worth the lawsuit. I can't help but wonder why he kept those photos then? \"The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference\" Not sure if I'm being too melodramatic, but I feel like he should not be SO upset when mentioning about someone who he broke up with more than a decade ago? Should I be worried, or am I completely overreacting?\nTL;DR:"}

I think maybe at one point I was, but I just can't bring myself to feel that way anymore. We're very VERY different people, different tastes, different attitudes.

I don't get along with her friends. \n\nBut, myself being the beta wall-flower I am, very much pretend like I'm happy, and shower her with praise because I like seeing her happy, and I feel like lying to her might make me stop lying to myself, and start feeling that way.

The clapboard siding has paint peeling off of it, and plenty of holes that the neighborhood birds have discovered make great nest locations.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: FWB [F27] of 4 months suddenly brought up the \"What if I get pregnant?\" question leaving me [M31] with unshakable panic and dread.\nPOST: So we're hanging out 2 nights ago when she suddenly asks me \"What if I get pregnant.\" My initial reaction is I laugh (more on that later) but then we talk seriously about it and what comes out is that she won't have an abortion but would consider giving the baby up for adoption. I told her I wouldn't be ok with that and would raise the child myself if it came down to that. Neither of us explicitly mention us raising the child together. \n\nSo here's my real problem. Her question is not an unreasonable one as we're having sex regularly. But the situation is highly unlikely. She has a copper IUD that's good for another 5 years or so and it's probably the most foolproof birth control available. I also know she's not currently pregnant, she was on her period the previous time we hooked up about 5 days earlier. Also it would conflict with her long term life plans to get pregnant now since she plans to live outside of the country for at least a few years once her current work contract is up in a few months. So why am I left with this overwhelming feeling of dread and panic?\n\nA little bit about me. I'm not normally terribly emotional. My initial emotional response to almost everything is to laugh, even if I think its not particularly funny. A therapist told me once its nervous reflex, but I don't consider myself particularly nervous. I'm not really prone to anxiety, and while I might avoid thinking about things when I put my head to a problem I'm usually pretty decisive with a course of action. But this. I've got nothing. I keep thinking about what I should do. My mind keep circling around it to the point of distraction. I like the brief time we spend together (a few hours, once or twice a week.) but I know we couldn't ever have a real relationship and raising a child together would be an absolute trainwreck. I also know that its nearly impossible for her to get accidentally pregnant and it makes no kind of sense for her to get herself pregnant on purpose. Normally this would be an easy thing to put out of my mind. But this time I can't and I don't know why.\nTL;DR:"}

Please don't offer any unless you know what you're talking about\n\nHere's my problem: My country's medical system has failed me.\n\nYou see, my wife is pregnant and we decided to have a maternal serum test performed. The problem is that the lab staff screwed up the input to the test computer and we got no meaningful results. And they refuse to fix their cockup and run the analysis again.\n\nAt 16 weeks and 3 days into her pregnancy my wife went for a genetic screening test which consists of a blood test that measures three blood markers (hCG, AFP and uE3) to determine the baby's likelihood of Down's syndrome, neural tube defects and/or Trisonomy 13/18. However, lab technicians entered the wrong gestation period (23 weeks 3 days instead of 16 weeks and 3 days) and the computer spat out some nonsense about the gestational age being out of range for the test. This is what they sent back to my GP. The GP was puzzled as well.\n\nWell at least we goaded them to give us the actual blood marker results. However, I don't have a way of interpreting them because I have no access to the software that calculates the various risks. If you do I really need your help!\n\nHere are the values that the lab sent back:\n\nAFP: 40.9 ng/mL\n\nuE3: 4.98 nmol/L\n\nhCG: 23.0 IU/mL\n\nHere are the correct values for input parameters that *should have been used* for the interpretation:\nMother's DoB is March 28, 1977. First day of the missed period was 17 November 2010. The anticipated birth date is August 25, 2011. The blood sample was taken on March 7th 2011 (making it 16 weeks, 3 days gestation at the time).  Mother's weight was 111lbs at the time of the test and her height is 5ft, 5inches. No diabetes.\n\nPlease, reddit community, I'm really anxious to know whether these numbers indicate a healthy baby. In this country I have no access to any other prenatal tests so these numbers are all that will be available to us.\nTL;DR:"}

He lost his dad at the end of last year.  \n\nSometime during the past year I noticed we stopped saying 'I love you' to each other. I don't know if it was the stress of school, dealing with death or my total loss of emotions from the birth control I was taking at the time. I brought this subject up with him a number of times. The first few times I get 'If I didn't love you, why would I be here?' (We live in his home, that he owns) and if I didn't 'why do I buy you things'? He used guy logic to my questions. I've told him it makes me sad that he doesn't say he loves me. He says 'it's just a saying'. When I say I love you to him, he says it back in a stupid voice, almost in a mocking tone. \n\nI've told him I don't need him to say all day, everyday. Maybe you know once a day or hell once a week. I'm not needing to be smothered with constant lovings. We have always been comfortable with each of us doing our own thing when we want to. \n\nI'm sure me working 3 to 11 afternoon shifts doesn't help with him working days M-F. I've tried to talk to him about the future and he always includes me, however, something seems off. Our sex lives are sucky too. Maybe once or twice a month and I've started 90% of the sexy times in the past 7 months. \n\nSo I'm stuck with what I do next. I either go all emotional on him or say fuck you and leave.

I am from a semi-traditional Chinese family so rules are important but some formalities and traditions are lost. So, I've interacted with his parents before and for the most part, they're pretty chill. They're really nice to me and I follow their considerably traditional cultures like: no sign of intimacy in front of elders, and respectfully sitting upright in front of them (something i learned from my BF). \n\nThe problem I'm having is that I'm not fully aware of all the traditional Korean cultures. And redditors, if you could please give me some advice so I don't seem like a disrespectful girlfriend? I would really appreciate all the advice given (serious ones, of course).

Right now it is winter break and we are unable to be together in person, so we will usually FaceTime or just text. I am really into this girl and falling hard for her and am pretty affectionate towards her.\n\nSometimes when we text I feel like it can be difficult speaking to her. If she is busy watching a movie or something, I will say something like, \" I'll let you watch the movie, have fun!\". A lot of times her response will be like, \"noooo I want to talk with you but I think it's late and you should probably rest\".\n\nShe does this a good number of times in different situations and I'm not sure if she's jus being nice and giving me freedom, or if she doesn't want to talk to me then, or if she does want to talk but not feel controlling.\n\nIt confuses me, and I honestly wish she was a little more controlling because this seems so passive to me.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation, am I just thinking about it too much? Should I tell her I want to talk to her but not if she doesn't want to talk to me? Am I just too obsessed with her and smothering her? Help please!\nTL;DR:"}

I've liked her quite a lot during this time, but had gotten over her after somewhat of a breakdown in communication and her getting a boyfriend. Communication breaking down was not due to the boyfriend, it had happened earlier - possibly a mixture of me not manning up to just ask her out and me pulling a random girl I met in a club right in front of my aforementioned female friend.\n\nRecently she started talking to me again and in general we're enjoying each other's company. She started talking to me again just after she broke up with her boyfriend, though whether the two events are connected in any way remains dubious.\n\nSince we started talking again, I've been thinking about her a lot more than somebody who's \"moved on\" should be. I think just going ahead and asking her out might be the best course of action for myself. If she says yes all is self-explanatory, if she says no I can definitively move on without the \"what if\" nagging me at the back of my head.\n\nMy question is, though - if she says no, how likely is it that we'll remain friends? I enjoy spending time with her and want to continue doing so in whatever capacity. Anyone (guys who got shut down after manning up, or girls who've done the shutting down) care to weigh in?\nTL;DR:"}

Today she tells me that she thinks that she possibly has cancer. She went to a doctor's office yesterday and was told that many of her symptoms appear cancerous, and was referred to an emergency room for an MRI. She goes to that tomorrow, and by Tuesday we should know for sure what's going on.\n\n...\n\nHere's where the friction happens: she has adamantly stated that if she has cancer and it isn't guaranteed to be like... under a month of chemo, she won't undergo any sort of treatment whatsoever, and elect instead to just let whatever cancer is there do it's work. She says that she's known people who have undergone chemo and been completely miserable and would rather just die. She has said that she thinks that her friends and family would understand (I highly doubt that, but I can't argue in their place), and she doesn't see any reason to try treatment for me, because I've told her in the past that while it's possible that the relationship will end in marriage, I won't make any promises because... well, we're 19 in our second year of college.\n\n...\n\nMy issue is that if it turns out to be cancer, I don't know if I can stay and watch her rot from the inside slowly and painfully, especially since I'm essentially the only person who could possibly talk her out of it. I briefly discussed it with her and she basically said she kind of gets what I'm saying, but she would still think I'm a horrible person for breaking up with someone over cancer anyways. I'm tempted to agree, but that doesn't mean it makes my choice any easier. Does anyone have any advice or experience for a situation like this?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/running\nTITLE: My experience with five hour energy and a 5k\nPOST: Short background to why I made this decision:\nI signed up for a 5k race without realizing that I had a flight back home that exact morning at 5am, while the race was at 9am. Since the flight was overnight and I can't sleep on airplanes I was about to run the 5k on zero hours of sleep. So figured an hour before the race, lets try a five hour energy and see how it works out.\n\nAnalysis:\nI took the drink an hour before, and while waiting for the race I experienced no real changes in my energy other than getting myself pumped like I usually do for a race. But right as I walked to the starting line and the race started, I could definitely feel a larger amount of energy that I had previously not had while waiting for the race. As the race proceeded, my heart rate was steady and I ran the race as I feel I normally ran 5ks, but with zero hours of sleep. I was shocked that I had the same output that I had when I normally ran a 5k. After finishing, I was extremely happy, not only at the result, but because I realized the five hour energy had actually helped me. I had no crash and since I had run a 5k, I was as tired as I normally was.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile I thought about the consequences before I took the drink, I was happily surprised with the result. I would never have gone to such an extreme as to take an energy shot for such a short race, but it paid off. This isn't saying that everyone should do this if they're tired, but I found no negative effects due to the runners high afterwards. All I can say is that I'm impressed with the output I gave with the amount of sleep I had previously, and 5 hour energy definitely helped me.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Advice about my very very non-outgoing boyfriend?\nPOST: (We are both males and he's a senior in high school and I'm a junior in high school)\n\nLet me preface this by saying I truly do love my boyfriend. We had dated three months over the summer, and broke up because there was a distance between us and it was hard to see him often, since my mom didn't know I was gay and I had no license. Recently I got my license and I am fully out to my mother and pretty much everyone else. We recently got back together, and he really is an amazing guy. It's like we never stopped dating. \n\nAnyway, here's where the issue comes about. My boyfriend is really shy, quiet, innocent to many things, and slightly insecure. I, on the other hand, love partying, am always the \"center of attention\", and I'm just a very outgoing person who loves everything to be exciting. It's tough, even going to the mall he wants to leave an hour after we arrive because he hates all the hustle and bustle. He hates going to parties if there are more than six or seven people there, and he just prefers to stay at home and watch a movie. He always seems very sedentary too. Now I know this sounds like I'm complaining a lot, but I do love him and I really love being with him. He was picked on and actually violently beat up a lot of his life by kids in his school. I think that's the reason he's so shy and insecure now. He gets picked on quite often, though not as much anymore. He just I think was never able to mature enough emotionally. On top of that, he lives only with his father, and his father is often gone for days at a time with his girlfriend, so he's home alone more often than not.\n\nSlightly-NSFW Warning: Another thing about him is in the bedroom, he ends up being VERY submissive. To the point where he just lies there almost when we do anything. I end up giving him a handjob or blowjob until he finishes, but it seems he never does anything to me for more than a minute, I end up finishing myself off while finishing him off.\nTL;DR:"}

I had just bought a new pistol and wanted to go to the range to try it out. Called a friend, we gathered all our firearms, bought a bunch of ammo, and set out to make a day of it. On the way we stopped at another friends to borrow his 12 gauge so we could do some skeet shooting. Our friend gives us his gun, and says \"try out this ammo I got, it's called Dragons Breath. Its supposed to shoot a flame out of the barrel.\" So we take it cause that sounds pretty awesome. We get to the range, spend the day shooting our pistols and rifles, and save skeet shooting for last. This range is in the middle of the woods, the skeet area is two platforms above a large field that is bordered by woods. We finish skeet shooting, pack up to leave and remember the Dragons Breath. My friend talks to the range master who says \"sure you can shoot it\". So we get set to transform a 12 gauge into a flamethrower and fire this demon slug into the air.. Turns out it shoots what's closer to flaming embers than flames 200 yards in the woods. About 2 min later we see smoke and flame rising up from the trees like dare I say Dragons Breath. FUCK!! We grab the cooler we brought which is full of water by now and run down range into the woods like a couple of idiots who just started a forest fire. There we are down range in the middle of Smoky the Bears worst nightmare with sticks trying to control the fire while people are still shooting and we are being engulfed by smoke. Eventually the range master shut the range down and we got the fire under control. But not before 2 fire stations and the Park Ranger showed up, threatened to fine us and charge us $35/hour for himself and every firefighter.\nTL;DR:"}

We've all gotten in the habit of going on big trips with one another, doing AirBNB and such.\n\nA few people have demonstrated that they always end up not having fun and bringing me and my wife down. Or they end up being very needy towards us. \n\n(To be specific, one girl thinks she is my wife's best friend. She moved a while ago, and obviously is not as close to the people who still live near us. I get why being far away might cause someone to be insecure, but she gets very jealous of my wife and I being better friends with other people. She gets competitive and makes silly comments that make everyone uncomfortable. For example, she got jealous when another friends dog got a lot of compliments because she felt like no one liked her new dog that much. I find her to attempt to guilt people into being her friend rather than trying to be fun.)\n\nA couple others, we are just less close to, and don't want to spend multiple days with any more.\n\nI have a smaller, more select group of friends that I want to go on an amazing vacation with. I don't want to invite everybody. Due to Social Media, they will know its happening. Some will feel like they should have been invited.\n\nI would still go on large vacations with the other friends, but this trip suits a smaller more stable group.\n\nI am usually a very direct person, and I hate lying and deception. But it feels extremely cold to say \"You're not fun on vacations\". \n\nHow do I navigate this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

There is this girl in my grade, and a few of my classes, that I really really really like. Me and her have been going to school together for about 2 and a half years, but I haven't really gotten to know her well until about a few months ago. Her and I have a lot (and I mean A LOT) in common. We're both redditors, we both like similar music, play video games, the whole shebang. Also, she is my next-door-neighbor, so that's a bonus. Some background: I recently got out of a 4 month relationship (my first real one) with a girl that I didn't really like that much. I was glad to get out of there, mostly because I really was starting to like this other girl (the neighbor one). Her and I have become very close in the past month or so, and we see each other everyday in school and most days after school. It's nice and all, I get to spend time with her, but I want to, you know, take it up a notch. I just really am starting to feel like she doesn't like me that way, at all. So, would it be weird if I told her how I feel and she didn't feel the same way? I don't want to lose our friendship, but I really want to be with her.\nTL;DR:"}

We backtracked from \"boyfriend/girlfriend/in a relationship\" after three months of playing house into a lighter arrangement that works more for her (she is craving the freedom - even if she doesn't pursue it). \n I've been patient and understanding of her situation (openly missing her ex, letting it affect our time together, the general hot & coldness of her confusion), while still trying to advocate for my rights.  We still spend most of our free time and weekends together.  We also still say \"I love you\" and plan vacations together.\n\nLast night, while missing me particularly more than usual, my \"girlfriend\" went on an Instagram photo-liking spree that went back to pictures over a year old - which featured me with an ex.\n\nNow my \"gf\" is upset because she feels like the intimate things we've shared are all motions I've done a million times in the past.  She attributed my similar phrasing in captions to what I've told her (and meant) and completely discredits every sacrifice I've made to be with her while she figures out all of her issues.\n\nHow can I show her that what I say and do for her are genuine and sincere?  I've tried explaining that she can only set the bar for future girls I meet, and not the ones I settled for before her.  I'm so tired of fighting and making it be known how special I think she is, only to have it all not count during a moment of jealousy or insecurity.  I just want to be with her and help her achieve her goals.  I'd also love to make her happy and be happy in the process.\n\nIt might also help to include she is bipolar (mostly happy, manic times), and is also due for her monthly visitor.   It's a lot to deal with and I'm trying not to be an emotional jerk than makes decisions based off of emotional reactions.\nTL;DR:"}

She accuses me of not caring for her, of not listening to her, and not helping her with the home or that I demand too much from her.\n\nThis breaks my heart because for 6 years that we've been together I've always did everything I could for her, her accusations made me lash out at her, because when I arrive home after a day of hard work she's usually in a very bad mood or extremely tired and it crushes my happiness of going home, seeing her and relax for a bit.\n\nThe financial situation won't be a big problem since she will get benefits for many months until she ends up finding a job.

We have no derogatory marks on our credit reports, we never have had late payments, never had any significant debt (aside from our car payment, but we don't really count that. 12k isn't too significant), etc.\n\nAlthough I am happy with my current financial situation, I want to branch off from my husband's credit account and apply for my own card. I went through the FAQ and read up on the most popular credit cards (Barclays, Discover IT, Chase Freedom) and I was just curious to know if any of the cards outweigh the other in terms of being used as a \"beginner\" card. I keep hearing good things about the Discover IT card, especially from friends who are closer in age to me than others, and I like how the cash back categories rotate every quarter.\n\nI'm not looking to spend huge amounts on this card. My monthly bills are already automatically set up to take right out of my checking account. So I will only be using the credit card for \"fun\" purchases, gas, and groceries.

Then i got a few pictures and a video recording of Noodle walking around the tank without a shell, and i was worried, so i put new food and water in there as well (the banana slices i left in there a few nights ago were now brown and squishy, and the water had evaporated overnight because it is in the triple digits here and we currently don't have air conditioning). I pulled the old exoskeleton out of the sand, scooted the bigger shell closer to Noodle, and watched it crawl in. I left it alone and came back a little while later and it hadnt moved from that spot, so i picked it up to see if i could get it to come out of its new shell... And its claw fell off.

There's actually sincerity when we talk about it. He refers to me not just as a girlfriend, but as a partner. When we talk, he wants to grow with me, not just be with me. I feel like an adult when I'm with him, like we're growing together, and I really like that.\n\nCurrently he lives with two roommates, and one of his roommate's gf stays there most of the time. He has discussed with his roommates to rent a house and in this case, it would be five of us in a three bedroom house. \n\nI live alone, and privacy is very important to me. I feel like living with  four other people would be a step back. I honestly like his friends, but I don't know if there living style would coincide with mine. Case in point, their kitchen is constantly messy and the sink is brimming with filthy dishes. \n\nI would love to move with him, but I'm not sure if I would be willing to move in with his roommates too. Is it too early to move in with him, and even so would it be a good idea?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Should being overweight or a teenage mom really be perceived as socially acceptable?\nPOST: If anyone watches Glee, the most recent episode features a performance with the pregnant character expressing her anger from being looked down upon in school. It almost felt like it was celebrating or empowering her status as a teenage mom (and exploring the pain that they go through). Regardless of your interpretation of the performance, I think some of you have came across attempts, in media or public forums, to \"normalize\" teenage pregnancies or, at least, deter open criticism. I believe that is the case with obesity; the phrase \"you are perfect the way you are.\" exemplifies the sentiment. \n\nI am conflicted. I don't think that anyone should be ostracized socially or discriminated against based on appearance or strictly personal, noncriminal decisions. However, I believe that social stigmas do, in specific cases, deter undesirable or encourage desirable behavior in society. An example, strictly based on my personal experience, is that the social stigma attached to smoking, rather than the detrimental health effects, is the primary reason for decline in cigarette use.\nTL;DR:"}

Our relationship had its ups and downs, but she said she was emotionally exhausted. Recently we have started to hang out again as friends. \n\nI have very strong feelings for her, and want to show her my affection. She doesn't mind being near me, even holding hands, but she refuses to kiss me or anything else. This frustrates me to no end. She insists that those feeling for me no longer exist. She wants me to move on, but I simply can't.\n\nBefore our breakup I had made a plan to propose to her which she doesn't know about. I still think of her tenderly, but when I try to talk to her about it she becomes very abrasive and makes it clear that she has no interest in me. I become emotional and the conversation often turns hostile, with each of us pointing to events during our relationship in which we slighted each other.\n\nEach of us wants completely opposite things.

She had this plan of being married two years ago, and she told me that she kept waiting and waiting for a proposal, and it never happened, and I feel terrible because I ruined her dream/plan. \n\nMy two reasons for delaying are financial and religious/family. Right now I am still trying to get my career together, working a so/so job and currently enrolled in a masters program. I've read many redditors responses that money should never be a reason not to get married, but this never made much sense to me. Then there is the religious/family issue. Her family is very religious and I am not. And I'm aware of the pressures that are going to come from the family when/if we do marry such as me converting, or pretending like I've converted to satisfy her side of the family (which I really don't want to do), and raising my kids by her religion. \n\nThe religious/family thing certainly scares me, but it's not the biggest thing holding me back. It's really more the financial instability I foresee us going through. But perhaps that's a bad reason not to propose. I really don't know. I'm lost and I can feel a really bad tension between my girlfriend and me. I don't want to lose her. She's my everything.\nTL;DR:"}

The one was legendary and the other I was being a complete derp. Legendary one first, my father, me, my brother, and a few of his buddies hired a guide to do a presidential traverse. All of us have technical experience and were fit, but none of us had encountered extreme conditions. The night before we realize the weather may be bad, but we continue on. We get to Grey Knob hut and a few people decide not to go, so it was me, mark, my dad, and my brother going to summit Mt. Adams. We get 80% to the summit, my father and I were drained of energy and a storm was a'brewing. 20ft from the summit, the storm hits. 80 mph constant winds and 105 mph gusts, we crawled to the summit and we just wanted to lay there. Scariest moment was the realization that there was a good chance we were going to die, Mark grabbed my face and started screaming to \"get the fuck up or we are going to die\". Now Mark, the guide, was on Everest and his facial expressions with his horror stories were nothing like the fear on his face then. My dad wouldn't get up, I ended up rolling of the summit, and picking him up and pushing him along. We were roughly halfway down, no goggles, we lost the cairns, and my my face and ears was badly frost bitten. We finally get down, and the rest of our party was not even worried -_-. More than I bargained for, but it was literally epic.\n\nMy second story, I was driving down my school road going 25-30 mph, which is the speed limit. Forgetting that the road was wet, i didn't slow down on a curve, went straight into the bank 30mph and flipped my car. I wasn't wearing my seat belt, which was so stupid of me. I came out WITHOUT a scratch. My backback flew from the back of the seat inches from my head and flew through the windshield, it would have most likely broken my neck if it hit me. My car was totaled, 9 grand in damages, a 1 grand deductible and a fine for \"driving on roads laned for traffic\".\nTL;DR:"}

I dropped the ball as I was about to put the ball down. This means that the opposition would get a scrum, which they would probably win and stop them from conceding 5 points.\n\nIt was not over, the referee (definitely not biased at all) decided to give me a yellow card for attempting to show off and making our rivals feel bad about themselves. Yellow cards in rugby are different to football. If you receive a yellow card, you leave the field for 10 minutes and you can't be subbed off, meaning my team had to play without a full team. We conceded three tries while I was off.\n\nWhen I got back on, the opposition team weren't impressed by my showing off.

Constant text messages while I was working, sent me nude photos, calls, he made a fake email address to email me, everything. At one point he ejaculated into the bathroom where I was cleaning, and asked me to \"clean that up.\" \n\nI was terrified for my safety. Sometimes I could not even come into work because the anxiety made me vomit and get sick. I complained to the supervisors of my contracted company that this guy will not stop sending me explicit sexual texts. A few days go by... but nothing stops or changes.

Before entering the Kentucky shelter, she had a litter of puppies (at an age they say was too young for her).

She is fully house trained, doesn't chew furniture, and doesn't even bark. She is good when she meets other dogs too. It's their owners she doesn't really like meeting.\n\nIf we kept her we would seek some help for her to overcome her anxiety. She's just the sweetest thing.

Ive been so happy over the last 2 months, I thought I'd finally found what I was looking her. It's such a shock and I don't know what to do. After so many things not working out and now this everything just feels so pointless. I wish I could just be so happy alone but it's just not me. I don't think i can be completely satisfied unless I have that feeling back again. But I don't know whether to just fight it and force myself to stay single unless something happens naturally. Or keep on trying? It's just becoming so draining\nTL;DR:"}

We are back together, he found out, and he doesn't believe we didn't do anything.\nPOST: We had been together 6 years when I decided I needed to be single for a while. We broke up and about 3 months later I was hanging out with my cousins and a mutual friend of me and my ex. We were all drinking a lot. I had drank too much so the friend was trying to make me go to sleep and took me to my room. I tried coming on to him but he was reluctant. After a few minutes he freaked out realizing that I was his friend's ex and left. The next day I was writing this all down in my journal trying to figure out why the hell I did that because I still respect my ex and wouldn't want to hurt him. At the time I didn't even think it would cause problems for the friend because I was only thinking of myself. I regretted even trying to do anything.\n\nFast forward a few more months and my ex and I get back together. After a few weeks of everything going great I come home one day and he says he read my journal. He thinks I had sex with his friend and is pretty much heart broken over it. He talked to his friend who told him it was all me coming on to him (which it was) and that he didn't do anything with me. I told him nothing happened and it was a drunken mistake. I still don't think he believes me though cause he'll bring it up randomly. I know he feels hurt that his friend and I could betray him like that but nothing happened and we were broken up at the time. Should I feel guilty over this? I already went though feeling guilty over it and thought it was over. I do feel bad for the fact I could have put their friendship in jeopardy but am glad we didn't go though with anything.\nTL;DR:"}

I say yes, because I don't want to have to crawl over them and potentially hurt someone, so the husband moves over, but he's struggling a bit because he looked pretty fragile. As the wife was moving to the middle, the flight attendant came up and told me I could just sit in the seat behind the couple in the next row, and tells the wife that I'm going to do that. So the wife stops moving, I move back, and now the husband is sitting alone at the window, and the wife is sitting in the aisle with a seat between them. I watched them sit awkwardly away from eachother for the entire flight, not talking, and sitting in silence (they had been talking before I'd gotten there), and I felt like the most horrible human being for separating these sweet people.\nTL;DR:"}

There was labs every other day in this class. One day my classmates and I were working with a solution that contains large amounts of potassium  hydroxide. This solution is extremely basic (meaning it can burn and damage skin). To conduct the experiment we put this solution into a pipette and tie the end of it to seal the solution in the body.  You are supposed to do this in a fume hood (a solid, overhanging wall that protects the user from the contents and reactions\u2122 that occur in the hood). I was tying the end of the pipette when the tip of the darn thing, converted in the solution I just extracted, sprang towards me like a rubber band. With no fume hood to protect me, the solution for all over my face (thankfully I was wearing goggles). I had to go to the eye wash station for 5+ minutes. I was embarrassed, and my jeans were wet.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I have known each other for a year, dating for almost six months. We've had many discussions about this. I understand that waiting is difficult, but it's really important to me.\n\nThe problem is that there have been several instances that have made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and even betrayed. I make it clear that I am uncomfortable and that we need to stop when I feel we are going too far, but sometimes he holds my hands in place and takes a few moments to let go. As far as I'm concerned, no means no, and he should immediately let go.\n\nBut what bothers me the most is that about a month ago, I turned around to find his shorts lowered and everything on display. I immediately turned back around, expressed how uncomfortable and disappointed I was, and sat down. I was really upset, and so was he. He was sorry. He didn't understand why I didn't want to see him. He thought it would be funny. He eventually took ownership of his mistake and apologized.\n\nBut I still feel really, really uncomfortable about this. I feel like it's a betrayal of trust and a failure to respect me and my boundaries. He's been a lot better since then. And he's a really great guy: intelligent, compassionate, kind, loving.

We're quite literally on the edge of breaking up. We've been together for over a year and half. We both love each other, and she has repeatedly stated that this week. We're each other's best friends.\n\nWe've had cyclical bickering problems. It really takes a toll on her. We've discussed it a few times before and state each time that we would \"work on speaking better to each other\". We have what appears to be terrible communication skills. \n\nDuring our conversations about ending it this week, I realized that we've both had terrible role models all our lives and that we need to re-educate ourselves on how to speak in a healthy manner. She agrees that this is true. To me, saying that we'll work on \"speaking better\" is a good start, but we don't realistically have any resources to do so. I feel like our communication skills are acquired throughout life, and not easily changeable on your own.\n\nI really want to keep working on it with her, but she keeps saying she doesn't have any try left. However, she still loves me. She came over today to say goodbye. I asked her over and over to go to counseling with me, to at least see if there's anything we can salvage. She refused several times and then ultimately agreed. I'm not sure if she agreed to it for me, or because deep down there's some try left in her. I said if we go to a session, and she doesn't feel it will do anything, I will walk away.\n\nI feel like an asshole. I really think our problems are fixable. She told me that everything else in our relationship is fine, and if we didn't have communication problems, then we would be great. I'm afraid I did the wrong thing though. I'm afraid I'm hurting her more or being unfair by asking this of her. Am I doing the right thing? I've heard positive things about couples counseling, but I fear that the initial session won't be enough to show her the possibilities.\nTL;DR:"}

Recently, I found out from some mutual friends that my girlfriend (26 F) had gotten drunk during a rocky spot/break in our relationship and had sex with another man. My understanding of this break is that we'd just take some time away from each other. I thought that she understood that. She's the kind of drunk that has no self control and can't remember anything. I found this out while hanging out with these mutual friends and my girlfriend. She denied it at first and I wanted to believe her, so I did. A week or so later, my friends tell me that she admitted in a text that she had sex. At that point she ended up admitting that things most likely happened with this other guy. Just to expand on things a bit, my girlfriend told me that she was going to tell me on her own eventually, but she was waiting for the right time. She also told me that she didn't mean for it to happen, but was too drunk to really control herself. Now this all happened a few months ago, and we had become a lot closer and stronger since then. I'm pretty much devastated right now because of this. I love this girl so much and I'd like to ask you guys if you think it's worth it for me to try and work through this.\nTL;DR:"}

She said she had more studying to do for finals and wants to get to bed early (completely understandable, it IS finals week).\n\nSo that obviously threw me off from kissing her. But in a last effort, I asked her to stay for just a few minutes to talk, which we normally do before she goes anyway, but she insisted that she really did need to go. So no kiss tonight.\n\nHere is where I need advice again. We only have this week till we will be away from each other for winter break. We don't know if we will be able to meet up once more or not.

What do I do?\nPOST: My boyfriend of over four years and I have broken up. The breakup itself started over a comment I made about what to use to get a stain out of the carpet. I guess I caught him in a mood because he blew up at me, yelling at me for over an hour about everything that's wrong with me and our relationship.\n\nIt was really difficult to handle not only because it was so hurtful but because it was so unexpected and SO belligerant. He would say one thing and almost immediately contradict it with another. He was so angry and made so little sense. He turns into another person when he's angry - yelling while insisting he isn't, completely condescending, purposefully hurtful, and just scary.\n\nHe said that he's been feeling this way for a year and half, and that he doesn't know what to do. I said that I love him, that I'm positive I want to be with him, and that I'll do whatever I can to make the situation better if he wants to be with me. After some time he said that he thinks we should see other people.\n\nI feel incredibly sad and heartbroken but ultimately if he was that unhappy and I was that oblivious I know it's probably best that we end things now. Our lives are so entertwined. We moved in together because we spent all our time together, we combined our finances when I got pregnant (we've had two miscarriages), we bought a vehicle together when we needed one, and we adopted a second dog together this year (I had one going into the relationship). I don't know what to do about any of it.\n\nMy family has been incredibly supportive, all offering me help and places to stay. It's not ideal - I love my home and I want to stay here, but it wouldn't make sense to live here alone - but it's all I've got for now.\n\nUgh. I don't know what to do with myself. We had all these plans and now nothing. Please help.\nTL;DR:"}

So I actually was following the law.\n\nAfter he walks away, I turn around squealing as many tires as possible. My reaction was to just sit there and stay quiet. I didn't say anything. This may be because that's what I always did when my father yelled at me (cause it pissed him off that I showed no expression) so that's what I did to this guy.

Unable to figure out my next move.\nPOST: I've been with my SO for 2 years and we are currently on a break for a short period as she is unhappy. I've found out what the issues were and that she feels trapped in our relationship. She's at the age where she expects to feel like she should be out doing silly stuff all the time and being drunk etc, and feels guilty about it.\n\nNow a few weekends ago she was out with her friends and got pretty blato and ended up going back to her male friends house, didn't sleep with or in his bed. She isn't that type of person, and they are very good friends. The unnerving part was I'd offered her a lift home yet she chose to go there. I picked her up the next morning and unravelled the spiral of lies to find this out, she admitted it all and told me the story.\n\nFast forward to this weekend, she was out again with her friends and i texted her a bit more than usual, obviously inside i felt like something like that could happen again and i wanted to make sure. I think this made the situation even worse and it spiralled out from there. We ended up having a really long conversation and she spilled the details what was wrong. Whats frustrating about it is that she's never brought these into light before now.\n\nAt the end of it she suggested giving space for a week and not communicating and then meet up to have a chat.\n\nI can personally feel where this is going, breaks never tend to turn out so well. Now I really would like to adhere to the week break, but I have a good feeling its going to end badly like this. I'd really like to salvage the relationship and have her work out the issues with me. But leaving it a week will just give her time to solidly sell herself off continuing I believe.\n\nAny life advice here? I've already cried my eyes out a billion and its only been 2 days :(\nTL;DR:"}

Obviously blackouts, forums, and social media have helped in protesting, but regardless of what anyone thinks of Anonymous in particular, in general I think this kind of hacking to actively protest poorly-thought-out measures to do what would more or less ruin the internet is a good idea.

The rent thing isn't so bad because we live together).\n\nHowever the whole time I was waiting for my package to ship or whenever I brought it up she would respond with some sort of derisive comment, and then saying 'you're so weird'. This was before I added the pipe in to my order, at which point she started saying 'you're being stupid why do you need that, it doesn't serve a purpose'.\n\nMy brother orders from the same website and I mentioned that I had been able to snag a pipe on my order(they go out of stock within five minutes of having more stock on their site). I told my girlfriend that my brother was jealous to which she responded 'why is he jealous? It's going to be a really shitty pipe anyway' I told her she was being rude which she brushed off. This upset me because I've been really excited about this for a couple weeks at this point, which she knew.\n\nWhen I talked to her about it later on she said that she felt I was being irresponsible with my money despite me Being a.) in a better financial position then her, and b.) her spending more money then I did. I brought these facts up and she started crying and saying that I always try to turn things around on her. I don't really get it.

This is her big day and we want to make it special.  Her family is full of drinkers so she is specifically making it a cash bar so she doesn't have to pay for all of the alcohol.  In order to get around this my \"friend\" and her date (she's in a long distance relationship but for fear of going to a wedding without a date asked a jerk to go along with her) want to pre-game.\n\nHere's the kicker: half of us are under 21, the BRIDE is under 21, this \"friend's\" date is under 21, and it's a small town wedding reception with grandparents and grandchildren.  Plus, this \"friend\" is my RA and she's constantly on my case for underage drinking and her responsibility as an RA to enforce rules.  This is one of many reasons why I consider her a \"friend\" and not a friend.\n\nI've told her I'm not interested in getting drunk or having anything beyond a champagne to toast with at the reception and she seems to think that I'm being a snob.  I've told her that it's her decision to do whatever she does, but I don't need alcohol to dance like a fool in front of random strangers.\n\nSo what's Reddit's take on this?  I don't really care about her making an idiot of herself in front of people she'll never see again, but it bothers me that she sees no wrong in being shitfaced (and yes, by pre-gaming she means getting drunk) in front of people whom the bride and groom consider family and friends.\nTL;DR:"}

Recently she came to the same roommate's (we are no longer living together but still good friends) birthday get-together.\n\nThat night we talked a lot and ended up crashing in my friends couch cause we were both drunk. Two other people were crashing to so it's not like we did it or anything. But we stayed up just talking and got very little sleep. When we did try to sleep we ended up almost cuddling in a way in the couch. \n\nWe would text each other and use snapchat almost daily for a good three weeks after that. She lives 40 minutes away so it's not the easiest to see her but we did see each other again. I invited her to an open mic event that I preform 3 acoustic guitar songs for. It was a group of friends and her so we didn't get many chances to talk one on one but it was a very fun night. I've invited her out twice after that but she says she's been busy. Understandable, but now shes not replying frequently and isn't making much of an effort to begin a conversation with me.\n\nI can't tell if I'm not being persistent enough, or maybe I'm being too pushy (I tend to start the conversations) maybe someone else caught her eye.

It was a shitty way to handle it and I'm very hurt and upset. I want them to know this was a terrible way to handle that. At the same time though, I want to keep my dignity and I don't want to respond from an emotional place. \n\nDo you guys have any advice? Has this happened to you before?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Girls of Reddit: Is having kids a turn off?\nPOST: So here's my question for all the girls/women of reddit. If you were considering dating someone and you knew/found out that they had a kid would that change the way you think of them or give you second thoughts on dating them?\n\nI ask because I am the father of a great 3 year old boy. The mother and I are long separated, never married, but do have a somewhat civil relationship for the sake of our boy. Since breaking up with her, I have only been able to maintain a fleeting example of a relationship. I've gone on a few dates and had a FWB situation that lasted about a year. \nI always have put forth the effort, given it the ol college try, but it seems like nothing pans out in the end (although this could be for another reason) however the girls i have dated i had a prior relationship in the past (co-workers, friends of a friend, etc) and they have known about my son and to some extent my past.\n\nSo as stated before, would having a potential date having a child be a major turn off for you or make you have second thoughts about whether to date him or not? and if so what is a good way to go about talking about it (from both ends)\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How long until I should start dating again?\nPOST: So I was in a relationship for 3 years and 5 months. We started dating when I was 18 and she was 15, when it ended I am now 22 and she is 19. We had plenty of problems the entire relationship. A little after a year into our relationship I found out she had an internet boyfriend and she broke it off with him when I found out. I tried to forgive her but I never really trusted her again after that and that pissed her off pretty badly\n\nFrom that point on several guys over the course of our relationship asked her to cheat on me with them and she told me about it right away, but then wanted to hang out with them alone and got mad when I was against that.\n\nThe last year we were together we went from having sex maybe 2 a month(she was never really in the mood) to almost never having sex. In the last 3 months we were together we completely stopped having sex.\n\nThe last 2 months we were together she became really secretive in the same way that she did when she had a internet boyfriend. She also dropped the bombshell that she was going to transfer to a college that was 200 miles away. \n\nI broke up with her(late November) shortly after this because I believe that since we had a lot of problems, that everything would only get worse in a long distance relationship.\n\nOn spring/summer/winter breaks we work at the same store and have to see each other daily.\n\nIf anyone needs more info I can provide it, just ask.\nTL;DR:"}

We are both fairly introverted and anti-social people. I have a small circle of friends, he only has 2 or 3 close ones. I've lately been trying to be more social and go out more because I'm bored with sitting around the apartment playing video games all the time.\n\nThere's a friend I know from college who I've been hanging out with and chatting a lot with lately. He's in town for the summer taking a class, while most of my college friends are back at their respective homes, so we've been hanging out a lot. We also play some games together and use voice chat to coordinate (stuff like LoL). My boyfriend sometimes gets weird about it. If me and the boyfriend are playing a game and my friend asks to join, my boyfriend usually refuses. If I decide to start up a game with my friend while my boyfriend is doing something else, he still gets upset and makes me feel guilty about it. I have no romantic interest in my friend and have told my boyfriend this several times. My friend also has a girlfriend he's been dating for 3+ years but she's in a different part of the state for the summer.\n\nSome possibly important backstory, my current relationship started as a result of cheating. Details aren't important but I started dating my current boyfriend before I officially broke things off with the guy I was dating before him.

I don't trust guys.\" Is there anything I can do to show him I have no interest in this friend and he has nothing to worry about?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [non-romantic] My sister[14F] won't stop obsessing and fangirling over things I like and ruining them for me[16F] .\nPOST: Ok, so me and my sister tend to like a lot of the same things. Our tastes in music, movies, etc are very similar. However, she always ends up obsessing over things and acting like a fangirl, whereas I prefer to appreciate things over time and not shove the things I like down other peoples throats. For example, we recently discovered the band Gorillaz. They are a great band and I am especially interested in the animation because I want to be an animator when I'm older. But I'm starting to hate the band because my sister won't shut up about them. The worst thing is how she is always trying to start conversations about them, which is fine of course, but she'll almost always do this at places like the dinner table where we are expected to maintain a conversation everyone can participate in. In situations like this I normally have two options, I can discuss whatever my sister is talking about with her and be seen as an obsessive fangirl by other people who are present, or i can attempt to ignore her or explain that no one else knows anything about whatever we're talking and end up with her being pissed off at me. Also, when i discover a new band, tv show, etc, I prefer to enjoy it bit by bit rather than binging on the whole thing in one night. My sister on the other hand is always trying to force me to overindulge on the things we like, which ends up making me get sick of it in a few days.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [22M] Hinging on a possibly polyamorous, possibly open, and potentially disastrous relationship with [22F] girlfriend and her roommate\nPOST: Preface: This advice post might turn out to be as confused and poorly directed as my feelings.\n\nAt a recent party in my girlfriend's apartment, I made out with her roommate, Tara, in front of her. Truth be told, this roommate has been sending me signals for a while, and has gone as far to talk openly with my girlfriend, Reagan, about how attractive she finds me. I've not opened up to my girlfriend about how attractive I also find her roommate. \n\nThe morning after the party, I'm riding a hangover pretty hard when I get the, \"Were you making out with my roommate?\" text. I'm ready to unload a rebellion of excuses when she outright tells me that she's okay with it because she knows I'm not attracted to her roommate. Now this is the probably the point where it becomes relevant to know that I'm not sure if I'm monoamorous or polyamorous, though I have a fairly strong lean towards polyamory that I have expressed to Reagan in the past. I also want it to be made clear that I still fully intend on upholding Reagan's exclusive relationship values, which I thought were rooted firmly to the core of her person, hence the situation, and my confusion. \n\nCurrently, I find myself lusting for Tara, and wanting to pursue her further. There are certain feelings you cannot shake and right now this is one of them. As far as needing advice goes, I'm not sure if waiting for these feelings to pass will suffice in the face of my raging libido and dwindling patience. I'm not sure if my emotions are guided by an insecurity in my self or an insecurity in my relationship. I feel like this is something Reagan and I should be able to communicate about, but also an issue that has the potential to destroy our relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

The airbags went off, the windshield is spider-webbed, the passenger side window is blown out (it was off the track), minor scratches to the front bumper, and I'm decently sure that the axle is messed up because it makes this weird popping noise while turning. The engine didn't start after the crash, but I figured out it was just a fuse for the fuel pump that had been blown which I fixed. The engine starts like normal now, but the check engine light is still on.\n\nBasically my two options are to either fix the civic or try to find a car that runs without very many issues for about $800-1000. I know the repairs for the civic would be upwards of $1000, but my mom thinks I should just try to get it repaired.\n\nI am 17 and am going to start working in a week or two and I want to get back on my feet in terms of driving ASAP. Im going to be working at a sub shop for minimum wage.\n\nIm leaning more towards trying to get another car rather than fix the civic because I honestly don't want to mess with the axle seeing as I feel that it would be a bit of a process and the whole point of this is to get me driving as soon as possible again to lighten the load on the family.\n\nWhat do you guys is best for me to do in my situation?\nTL;DR:"}

Before I made a rash decision I told her a few ground rules. 1.

I want him essentially erased, no pictures on facebook, instagram, ect.  3. She has to get tested \n\nShe seems very remorseful but when I asked her why she did this she I got maybe the crummiest response, \"I was caught up in being abroad, I was drunk, and the rest of the group split off and were sleeping with each other.\"  (But I guess any reason would be a shitty one).  She says she still loves me and that it meant nothing but it still has killed all the trust between us.\n\nWe only live 3 hours apart and I think that going to see her face to face will be helpful in making my decision on whether or not to continue the relationship.

I started calorie counting, slowly got down to 155 and then actually started going to the gym, focused on lifting and cardio. That combined with a pretty rough break up hurtled me down to 140 lbs.

Granted I was a much more muscular 180 than I was the first time I started losing weight, but I had too much fat.

I cannot seem to lose any more weight. I am running, and dieting (not starving myself) and nothing seems to work. In fact I am gaining some weight back, which is causing me to freak out.

Being a golfer myself, I wanted to take a picture with him. \n\"Excuse me Mr. Woods\" (not even 6-7 feet away)\n\nNo answer\n\n\"Excuse me Mr. Woods\"\n\nNo answer\n\nThen Eldrick looks at his security and then looks at me. Moments later I get some big guy telling me that I can't talk to him because he is busy. Not even 5 minutes later he is chatting away with 3 women in their early 20s. (This was before his marriage collapsed due to being unfaithful) Ever since then, I have hated Tiger Woods. Ass.\nTL;DR:"}

I know Charlie realizes this is a part of growing culture, and accepts mistakes will be made, but as their girlfriend I feel like I need to be doing better, and as the one person who should understand and be respectful the most, every time I make a mistake I can feel a tension. I just want to be able to get it right, and I want to separate the amazing PIV sex with the gender term. I can't seem to shake the ingrained pronoun of him and he when it comes to casual conversation and I want to make Charlie feel like they can truly be themselves around me, and I just know every time I mess it up I take their progress and mine back a few notches. It happens most often when I am talking about Charlie and someone else refers to them with \"he/him\" and I find myself almost immediately afterwards reverting back to incorrect pronouns to accomodate the conversation. Is there any advice to training myself on androgynous pronouns? Is there any advice to help me get over my guilt when i make a mistake? I know sometimes in conversation with Charlie directly I have screwed up, and we both noticed but didn't mention it. its that sting in the air that lingers for a short second, but no one says anything... those are the moments I want (need) to train myself out of and any advice would be extremely helpful.\nTL;DR:"}

I've confronted him about, his reply \"you know I like looking at pictures and you swear we never do it we just did it the other day.\" Its frustrating that even just to go out to the theater or do something that I want to do has to turn into a debate. I told him that if he doesn't want to be with me will end it or if I'm not as attractive as the naked girls then he should go find someone that is but he says no that he wants to be with me & if he didn't he would end it instead of wasting our time. Lately he let's me stay at his house for free, let's me use his credit cards if I need money, bought me a phone since mine broke but nothing has changed. Once in a while he says I love you or gives me kisses but Its not what it used too which is very disappointing because aside from the intimacy we get along so good.

Oh the stupidity.\nPOST: I went to the store to get some trash bags for the office today. When I was trying to pay for the bags, before I do anything, the clerk started leaning over the bar code scanner, looking at the card scanner as I swiped my card. When the price of the purchase and buttons, \"Approve\" and \"Decline\" appeared on the screen, before I could do anything that made since, she reached over and hit the red button with an X on it instead of the green one and said, \"Red stands for Credit.\" Now, as you can expect, the word \"Canceled\" popped up on the screen. So I told the clerk that red stands for cancel (as politely as one can after witnessing such an act). She ignored me. So, clearly, the most reasonable thing to do when something doesn't work, is to do the exact same thing again thinking that you were right the first time, something just went wrong with the computer. On the third time I swiped my card, she started looking at the computer, trying to find the problem there. So when the \"Approve\" button popped up on the screen, I quickly hit it before she could turn around and show me how helpful a clerk she could be some more. So when the receipt magically sprayed out of the machine, she said \"You're welcome.\" What blatantly stupid people have you come across that makes you wonder how we survived this long?\nTL;DR:"}

So I am a straight male and being attracted to woman, like most guys enjoy all aspects of a woman. Although like guys there are some things more appealing to certain people. E.g. ass guys, boobs guys, etc. So obviously as a straight guy it's hard not to enjoy the a nice set of breast on a beautiful woman or a nice buttock, but one thing that just really turns me on is the stomach of the woman. I have no idea what it is about the stomach that is so attractive to me. I don't particularly like woman with abs just a flat stomach is attractive beyond belief to me and amongst the group I hang around it's always about breasts or asses, whatever.

However, it resulted in me emotionally disconnecting from her. I just realized this about a week ago.\n\nMeanwhile, I developed feelings for her best friend Mary. We really get along, but there's been no physical intimacy or even talk of physical intimacy. When she visits, we three all have long talks or play games, but sometimes I feel like it's only Mary and me in the room.\n\nWhat clued me into that it might be an emotional affair is that she's going overseas for a month, and I'm really sad about it. It sounds weird, but I don't know what I'm going to do with my time. It made me realize that I don't have a strong desire to hang out with my wife alone. Also, it's like once I recognized this problem, it's only gotten worse. Mary has suddenly become attractive. She's like a fantasy in my head, and my desire for my wife has decreased even more. \n\nI'm really confused on what to do. I read that to end emotional affairs, all contact must be cut off. This sounds horrible to do to Mary because she hasn't done anything wrong. And cutting her off will impact her friendship with my wife.

Already on Friday I've started to have quite unrational thoughts that she would cheat on me.

She told me on Facebook that she went home early on Friday night and she usually check Facebook early in the morning, this time she wasn't online before 4pm the next day.\n\nI'm getting angry at myself for even thinking that she might cheat and for not trusting her and also that I bother caring about when she's online on facebook. Because it's all in my head. I would consider myself confident in many ways, I think I look good, I'm a fun guy and I know we are a great match, and she said so herself, I try to be honest with myself so I realise that this issue I'm having is due to some kind of confidence issues on my part.\n\nI think (and hope) all of this would be solved by just talking to her about what she said about cheating.

I'm also not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but the rules don't say anything about this peculiar post...\n\nI recently picked up a second major in English at the University of Delaware. This decision is largely due to the influence of my dad and the fact that I enjoy (and excel academically) at reading/writing. But mostly my dad.\n\nHe was super influential in my respect for education in general. He went to college during the Vietnam war and jumped around to many different universities in the Philadelphia/NJ area for several years in pursuance of an undergrad in literary studies (and in avoidance of the draft). He read a bunch and accrued a massive amount of literary knowledge during those years. It's really quite remarkable how much he knows. \n\nFor instance; I started reading \"A Confederacy of Dunces\", one book my dad never actually read. And yet, he knew not only the name of the main character, but also Ignatius' personality and historical influences. He was giving me information over a phone call faster than I was able to read about the book on wikipedia. \n\nAnyway; onto the reason for my posting. Way back in 1975 he took graduate classes at Villanova at night while working towards his teaching certificate by day. He was only within a few classes of a masters when he completed his certificate. He was eager to get to work at a high school in NJ and did not complete the graduate degree. His thesis was on the works of J.P. Donleavy. Now, 40 years later and at 68 years old, my dad is looking to finally complete his degree. JPD is still alive at 89 years old and my dad's thesis could be strengthened by an interview with the guy. I'm looking for any possible way to contact him and exchange emails or something so I can get the two in correspondence. They're both aging and the metaphorical clocks are running out. As you could imagine, this creates a sense of urgency here. Even if this isn't possible and JPD just wants to be left alone, I'd say it's at least worth a try. I'm posting here to bring attention to the effort and consolidate my resources/progress.\nTL;DR:"}

I totally understand we are all human, and who doesn't enjoy some harmless flirting once in a while?\n\nAnyways, since he's asked me, my only thoughts have been \"what does a wingman really do?\" I'm not really into the \"bar\" scene at all. I never have been. I don't like going after guys at bars, but I understand that is where some people go to meet each other. So, what kind of things are wingmen supposed to do? I'm assuming that his friend(s) will pick a girl and since girls travel in packs, he will be there to help \"run distraction\" by flirting with the girl(s) that the friend(s) aren't hitting on. When the friend(s) have hooked their catch, he will pull the \"I have a gf\" card and head home. Is that typical?\nTL;DR:"}

Ive been single but dating for the last year or so. I've had successful relationships before but lately I seem to just crash and burn and now it's making me so so anxious.\n\nOkay so basically I feel fine but as soon as I get talking to someone for a period of time even a few weeks or a month my scumbag brain starts going insane usually resulting in be behaving like a nutcase. I don't know if this is because I have had bad experiences with dating and men but I want to get over this!  I don't consciously think that it's going to go badly the feelings just bubble up at some point...aghhhh any advice or does anyone at least know what I mean?\nTL;DR:"}

He ignores his family in real life to play around with her and several other girls our age. She knows he is married, how old he is, that he has children her age and that he does this with other young women but she still continues to see him.\n\nI have told her time and time again that he is bad news, and she ended up breaking it off with him last month but now they're back together. Last week, I completely lost it and told her that she was making a mistake by being with someone so disgusting. I told her the truth, but I didn't handle it with hatred or immaturity, but she called me horrible things, told me that I was being judgmental. I haven't spoken to her in a week and she deleted me off of facebook.\n\nI used to be involved with men online like that when I was in high school and it really messed me up emotionally.  It's one of my biggest regrets in life and I don't want her to make the same mistake.\n\nShe hasn't been the greatest friend for me to be honest, but I care for her. She constantly mooches off of me, brings drama and jealousy. Even in our fight last week, she brought up how I never gave her good enough gifts for her birthday, etc.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this. She has completely changed  because of this creep and it's all going on under her parent's roof. I'm the only other person that knows about it. Should I contact her mom and tell her what's going on?

It's a shitty situation, and I came home this weekend to relax. Mom and dad are going on vacation, so I had to drop them off, using their car, at the airport at around 4 A.M. for their flight at 7. Combine that with a relatively late night, and I had no sleep. Dropping them off went fine, but I was doing 140km/h (87mph) on the way back, dreaming of my bed. Until I saw the flashers.\n\nI'm not sure what possessed them, but my parents have chosen not to keep the vehicle license and registration in the actual vehicle itself, so the officer, who is pulling me over at 4 in the morning, now has to deal with a possible stolen car doing an extremely high rate of speed. In Ontario, the speed I was going would have resulted in at least a $250 fine, and several demerit points to add to my license. Had he tailed me any earlier, I might have inadvertently been going 50km/h over the limit, which is grounds for instant suspension of license and repossession of the vehicle.\n\nIn short, by any measure of the law, I was going to be solidly fucked. \n\nI know enough about the law to say only what's necessary and never admit to my rate of travel, but I've been raised that if I've done wrong I own up to it. This officer, who pointed out that he'd been at the scene of a number of highway crashes, and that I had only a license, no registration or insurance, was as nice as he could legally be to me. Due to only having one ticket in three years, this offense is recorded as being ten over the limit (A $40 fine with no demerits), and though I've gotten two tickets for failing to produce insurance and registration, merely going to court with the pertinent documents will have those tickets removed. \n\nI am way luckier than I have any right to be.

Alright my main point here is I am so fucking pissed. All this Islam terrorist crap is fucking up everything! Besides the evil it is doing in the World, American Muslims are feeling the effects here. Now I may not be a full believer anymore but my kids are and my wife is, I will eventually let my kids decide what they want to do with their lives, but for now I believe it is no harm to bring them up as my wife is not really strict at all or super religious. Man, I just want to be able to play video games, celebrate Christmas with my best friends, grow old in a nice house with two dogs. Why should I be worried then? Well my family, my mom, dad and relatives are all still Muslim. That means that all this Islamophobia, if it gets worse will affect them, and shit that really sucks. No one wants to see their family go through craziness like that, especially when they are just normal Americans that work and come home and watch TV.

One thing leads to another, etc, and we started making out. I typed that so casually, but in my head it's still a huge deal. It quickly and easily turned into more. I was incredibly nervous, as nothing like it had ever happened to me and I didn't expect it in the least. Due to these nerves, I had trouble staying up, so to speak.

Should I change it?\nPOST: Hi Reddit,\n\nSo, my parents divorced when I was 2 years old and my dad moved away and remarried. He helped my Mum with child support, but I haven't seen or heard from him since I was a kid (now 24). It's not like I couldn't have if I wanted to, but the fact that he never showed any interest in me made it pretty hard to give a shit about him, and my Mum has always gone above and beyond amazing in the single parent role, so I never needed him and certainly never wanted my Mum to think I did. My Mum has never really shown any resentment about it though, and left my surname as my father's after she had hers reverted after the divorce.\n\nI'm graduating soon, and I sort of feel like I'm stepping out into the world with this surname that means nothing to me. I don't know if I want to start a career, and more than that a family, with this name. It's not exactly an uncommon surname, but part of me thinks it would be better to either take on my Mother's surname, or create my own to separate myself from my Father and start my own life/family/etc with no ties to someone who never cared about me. It sounds horribly self-centred and arrogant, but I want to do great things, and I know he'll always be my father in some sense, but he doesn't deserve any pride for who I am or what I do.\n\nDoes any of this make sense or am I way off track? Has anyone had thoughts like these before, or actually decided to change their surname later in life due to similar circumstances? I haven't really talked to anyone about this, and I guess I just want some opinions..\nTL;DR:"}

Every time I see her I feel a pull towards her and we end up talking a lot and I really enjoy myself. I went on Tinder and saw her, and swiped right. She had already liked me! I was stoked, and I messaged her, asking if she remembered the night we made out. We talked a bit, and eventually I texted her and we made plans for a date the next night. An hour before we were supposed to meet up, I texted to confirm, and she said she was feeling super hungover/had just gotten her period and asked if I could rain check. I haven't heard from her in about 4 days, and I'm not sure if I should reach out. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I believe it's a way for him to manage his depression. Last year he was completely obsessed with getting a motorcycle so I pulled out all the stops to get him one. Now he's completely obsessed with Pokemon Go. He plays it every single day, watches videos on YouTube. We started playing it together and I loved it because it was like we had a date every night. We'd go out hunting together and have more fun than we ever did hanging out at home.\n\nBut it's gotten to the point that he can't drive anywhere without playing the game WHILE HE'S DRIVING!! He has never been in an accident before so this is his justification for playing. He says he has plenty of experience messing around on his phone behind the wheel and he's in control. \n\nThis car is my work vehicle. I am the breadwinner in our home so if something were to happen to this car we would both lose our livelihood. I am not in any way comfortable with him playing Pokemon Go while driving my car. I have made this clear. He continued to play the game while driving the two of us around so I've just had to take over all the driving. Not a compromise I was thrilled to make, but it's not the end of the world. \n\nThen last night he asked me if he could take the car out to go Pokemon hunting. What we have been doing lately is he'll have a map on his phone and he'll navigate where we should be going around town and I'll drive. I was too exhausted to go out last night (this keeps us out until 1-2am) so he asked if he could go by himself. Meaning he wanted to not just play Pokemon Go behind the wheel, but switch back and forth between apps to find them (twitter to see where they are and maps to see how to get there). I was not at all comfortable with this so I said no. He hasn't spoken to me since.\nTL;DR:"}

Anyhow, we couldn't remember if the the World Cup was in '92 or '94 so in my head I start thinking of when the Olympics was and figure out when the World Cup occurred from there. For whatever reason, anytime anyone brings up the Olympics I ALWAYS think about the Beijing Olympics. Well, now China is in my mind and the guy I'm talking to about all of this looks Asian, I'm not sure what descent but it probably isn't Chinese. So anyways, I say well \"the '94 World Cup had a great turn out in Chin--\" and I catch myself and think, oh got he probably thinks I said that because he's Asian and I don't know maybe subconsciously I did, anyhow I catch myself, say Chicago, he makes a quick reference about being Asian or something.

He'll call her mean, selfish, etc, and point out how everything she is doing is hurting him. He is moving out at the end of August. She keeps trying to live her life and focus on herself so she can get over her own problems with anxiety (one of the main reasons she broke up with him). I'm her only friend so she keeps asking to hang out with me and asking to come stay the night at my house. We've had problems in the past about her constantly calling and texting me and then keeping me on the phone for hours with her problems. When I talked to a school therapist months ago, she told me it's okay to say no every now and then and not always be available so I was doing pretty well. But now that she's going through a break up, and they're living together, and I'm her only friend, I feel terrible for turning her away. She asks so often that I just can't say yes all the time but I also feel bad saying no so often. I live in a small studio with my boyfriend and I'm really busy with school and work. Today she offered to pick me up from school, come stay the night, and then take me to school in the morning but I REALLY don't want her to come over so I'm considering spending the night at school. I feel like I'm going crazy and I just don't want to be a part of her break up. It shouldn't be so stressful on someone who wasn't even in the relationship that ended right?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Wife and I want to save 20% of our gross income for retirement - does it matter how we allocate this between the two of us?\nPOST: As the title states, my wife and I want to save 20% of our gross income for retirement, not including any employer match contributions. Combined we make $140K - I make $77K and she makes $63K. Here is our current breakdown:\n\n-- I contribute 7% to my 401k to get my full employer match. 7% of 77,000 is $5,390, or 3.85% of our total $140K gross.\n\n-- My wife contributes 2% to her 401k to get her full employer match. 2% of $64,000 is $1,280, or 0.91% of our total $140K gross.\n\n-- We both max out Roth IRAs, $11,000 - this is 7.86% of our gross.\n\n-- I max out my HSA. Max contributions allowed per year are $6,550, but my employer contributes $1,000 each year and I don't want to include employer contributions in this number. So, $5,550 - this is 3.96% of our gross.\n\nAdding all of these percentages together, we are currently contributing 16.58% of our gross to retirement, so we need another 4%. The obvious answer is to increase contributions to our 401ks. Here's where my question comes into play: my 401k is fantastic, it has an excellent fund lineup with a ton of low expense ratio Fidelity Spartan funds. My wife's plan is horrible - limited fund choices, and the only fund with an ER below 0.4 is a bond index fund, everything else is higher and the target date funds are astronomical (1.25ish).\n\nSince my 401k is so much better, should I just increase my contributions to my 401K to get us to 20% savings? My wife has expresses concerns that she (on an individual level) is not contributing enough for retirement, but we share all of our finances, so I figured retirement wouldn't be any different. She's listed as beneficiary on all of my accounts in the event of my death, and if we get divorced (very unlikely, but should be considered) I assume we would just end up splitting everything.\nTL;DR:"}

Shortly after, a few months or so, i discovered he was with my close friend (of ~6 years). The timing of everything was ambiguous to me but I assumed that he'd just moved on really quickly. I was upset and i blamed both parties equally for hurting me because I felt that they had an obligation to at least talk to me. Not to ask permission or my blessing but just to breathe some word of it to me. Instead, a mutual friend accidentally blurted it out and that was how i found out about it all. From there, it just circulated and between all of us, myself, my ex and my friend, it was sort of unspoken knowledge that they were now together and that i knew. \n\nWe haven't talked since then (early this year) and I've been doing okay. I got over being sad/mad about everything but today i found out there was more to the story than i had originally thought.\n\nThey used to hang out one on one, a weekly occurrence that I was not aware of. On one occasion he kissed her and because we had exams coming up he decided he'd break up with me after that. Fair enough. After the break up I asked him if he had feelings for anyone and he straight up denied it. So he lied as well. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here. I understand what has happened but I'm lost as to what I should do. A part of me wants to make them know how badly theyve hurt me but a part of me feels like it's too far back to revisit it.

When she doesn't I end up breaking her heart and looking like an asshole.\n\nI don't really know what Im asking for here. I just want some advice really. How can I get emotionally connected to people again? Its not just dating either. I have lost 90% of my friends due to this. I just, I just don't connect anymore and I throw em out. I have like three good friends left. Two of them are honestly only still friends because they help with my music production stuff. If anybody has gone through something like this before and have lost trust in people please share any advice that helped you get it back.\nTL;DR:"}

We're amazing together and every time we go places, people ask us if we're dating and our friends have told me how great we are together. We mesh really well and are always on the same page when we're doing things.\n\nHe makes me feel comfortable in a way I've never felt before. I feel so at ease when I'm around him and when I'm sitting next to him all of my urges are telling me to lean over and melt into him. I know this feeling could be and used to be just really deep and meaningful friendship, but recently I've been falling in love with him. I know he has at one point in time or currently does feel at least a little similar.\n\nAt this point in time if I were reading this post from another person, I'd say \"TELL HIM!\", but there's more to this.\n\nAlthough we're amazing together and mesh really well, we'd make a horrible couple I think. We have opposing views on relationships and intimacy. He's also very closed off with his emotions and quiet, while I need a relationship with someone who is as open as me. I was once in a relationship with someone with a similar personality and it crashed and burned for these reasons. Having him in my life means so much to me and I'm afraid that if it were to end horribly, I'd lose him.\n\nI'm also moving across the country in two months and I'm afraid to bring up these feelings and maybe start something and then just leave.\n\nI think the best course of action is to wait it out and get over it, but I just wanted advice.\nTL;DR:"}

One day we were shown a picture about an article talking about interracial marriage. Me being the idiot I was, talked to my friend about how I understood why some people thought it was bad \"I mean it is kind of weird for a black father to be seen with a bunch of white children.\" My friend gave me a really strange look and it was awkwardly silent between me and him.\n\nI thought nothing about it until a week later I end up getting called up by my teacher. She tells me \"So I heard you were saying some pretty racist remarks.\" I looked at her confused and denied her claim. \"So you didn't tell _____ that interracial marriage was wrong?\" I responded \"Oh that, I didn't mean it in a racist way, I just think it was understandable why people might be against it.\"\n\nShe looked stunned and said \"I am going to move your seat away from him so you don't say things like that again okay?\" I totally hated her because I thought she was being unfair because I didn't see anything wrong with what I said.\n\nLooking back this was extremely cringe worthy that for one; I thought it was okay to hate interracial marriage. And two, I thought it was okay to tell a black friend that I thought it was understandable. **Where the hell did I go wrong with my past self?**\n\nI am just glad that he forgot about it, and is still really good friends with me.\nTL;DR:"}

Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit.\n\nAbout 2 and a half years ago, I managed to pass out in a sex education class when contraception was being discussed. In the following 2 weeks, I passed out in every class (Only one class a week, but that's not really the point). Pregnancy and words to describe different levels of sexual activity (e.g promiscuous) were discussed in those classes.\n\nMy parents took me to the doctors to see why this was happening and it was narrowed down to lack of sleep and a lack of oxygen reaching the brain when those subjects were being discussed around me (I have no idea as to why that was the case). At the time I believed it, as I frequently went to bed at late times before school. I ended up having to take a bottle of water into each lesson and perform a breathing technique each time I felt light-headed. While this helped, I later realised that the doctor may not have been entirely correct, as I will explain in the next paragraph. I have also experienced fainting with HIV/AIDS discussion (which was the first time I passed out) and a few minutes after getting an injection. I had gone to bed early (around 9pm) the night before the day of the injection, ate breakfast and still passed out. I also feel light-headed whenever I think of someone cutting themselves, particular in the wrist area.\n\nIt has baffled me ever since I passed out for the first time. Does anybody have any possible ideas as to why this may be happening?\nTL;DR:"}

So i do my whole session and the following night my arms are really sore but i just brushed it off as muscle pain. The next day (Saturday) i can barely move my arms and I'm walking around with two imaginary watermelons under my arms, little did i know they were actually completely swollen. Not knowing the day after (Sunday) I go to the gym again and start of with legs, then shoulders. Was pretty intense and was feeling sick doing my last set of shoulder exercises so i stopped and went home. In the afternoon i started peeing brown and was getting pretty scared, after doing some searches found out that I most likely had something called Rhabdomyolysis (rhabdo) which happens when you have the mindset of pushing yourself hard but you're body isn't ready (like mine). And its basically muscle tissue ending up in your blood stream and can cause kidney failure, and death, which isn't cool. So i guess moral of the story, if your want to start working out again, ease into it, but apparently you get rhabdo when its light weight and lots of reps, so maybe try doing running, rowing, before hitting the barbels! I'm out for a week or two now after only getting back and doing two sessions :(.\nTL;DR:"}

As you can imagine, it is extremely painful and has severely impacted her quality of life. It hurts to move, walk, etc. and has been terrible for the last few months. Her back doctor recommended a procedure called a discectomy which is kind of like surgery, but not as invasive (it's only a 4 day recovery process).\n\nThe doctor had about two or three conference calls with the my fiancee's insurance company, emblem, and they told us in January that it was approved. We heard that it was approved from both the doctor and the insurance company. A week later we booked the appointment for the procedure which was scheduled to take place tomorrow.\n\nYesterday, my fiancee gets a call from the doctor who said that the insurance company is now saying that they don't approve the procedure after all. This was after they mentioned they approved it on two separate occasions. What's odd too is that the insurance company said they'd approve it, but with anesthesia (meaning they had a clause in place already for this type of procedure) and now all of a sudden, two days before the procedure they say \"no sorry, we're not approving it after all\".\n\nSince the procedure didn't happen and they just simply canceled it, there's nothing we can do right? We are just so angry, frustrated, and helpless. This was the light at the end of a painful tunnel and now it's gone.\nTL;DR:"}

Compiling a list of how to best go about it.\nPOST: I've slowly started going through some of the motions, planning and observing the digital behaviour I still currently have. I'm learning how to live in ways that separate my day-to-day life from leaving \"trails\" that may allow obsessive, abusive or toxic people from my family and past to intrude in my life.\n\nI am currently retraining my thinking, way of living and way I conduct myself to better facilitate this. I have been trying to cut ties with my family and everyone from my past since I was 18. Members of my family or their affiliates have intentionally abused me into going into \"modeling\", which was simply their means of dumping me off into human trafficking at a very young age. It amounted to slavery because I wasn't being paid, was forced to do it and access to abusing me was traded around or \"paid\" for by various means.\n\nI became so used to these abusive ties that I did not fully understand what I had been brainwashed/conditioned to do, used as entertainment for like a piece of property and was part of for so long.\n\nI was never allowed to make friends with people who were outside of my family and abusive affiliates who could teach me how to stop them from using me and holding me in this abuse because they benefited from it. \n\nI am figuring out what needs to be done to get things in my life in order as best as reasonably possible without directly dealing with anything that is part of the abusive human trafficking ties that members of my family facilitated or directly \"dealt\" in by figuratively and literally enacting as my human trafficker/trader despite the blood relation to me some of them had. My father has also admitted to committing fraud and forging my signature, for example.\n\nThis is why I am collecting as many tips and information as possible from other people who may have changed their name and relocated in order to fully remove themselves from abusive relationships and dynamics on this level. Thank you for your time and any advice offered to help a person remove themselves from this as safely, reasonably and un-dramatically as possible.\nTL;DR:"}

Met over dinner with mutual fired and we had an instant connection. Sought each other out and after our first date we felt really comfortable with each other. It was the craziest thing I ever felt and neither of us could really explain it. Since then, we have been spending a lot of time together which is a new thing for me because I haven't had a boyfriend in the recent years that really sought out my company or wanted to be with me.\n\nThings have been mostly good. However we have been having some issues. I feel like a lot of the issues we may have is due to the exam period we just went through and spending a lot of time together.

But then again, we've been spending so much time together and this sort of dating is completely new to me and I don't how it is supposed to be. \n\nI think some people would just give up but I feel like a lot of it might be circumstantial.

She's going to be making a 6 figure income one day (I'm not), she's sweet, etc, etc. You get it, she's a catch in every sense, and I love her.\n\nLately, whenever we talk on the phone (she lives an hour and a half away for college) for longer than 20 minutes I start getting frustrated, like I just want her to go away. I have no idea why, but I'm unable to 'get over it' and just love her like normal. I get easily agitated when she misunderstands me or doesn't know something I think she should.

My current girlfriend is definitely the jealous type (story for another day), so I've kept the reconnect a secret. \n\nBasically, I'm torn, I feel like 2 different people with diametrically opposed opinions arguing incessantly.

Long distance relationship at first but eventually we moved in together. Emotionally we are at a great spot. She knows and understands me more than my family and I know her better than she knows herself. It's wonderful.\n\nThe problem is that as we became closer emotionally, our sexual situation has become nonexistant. First 2 or 3 years were pretty active, but now not even once a month. Why is that? I'm not sure. A few years ago she found out her thyroid level was slightly lower than normal. But she hasn't done anything about it. Possibly because she doesn't like the idea of having to take something on a daily basis, for something that is only slightly low. For me, over the last 18 months, I feel my desire for sex to be increasing. But it's hard to get into it, knowing (and seeing) she just doesn't have gusto, or desire for it.\n\nOver the last few months, I've brought up wanting to have sex more. She's said she enjoys it when we do, but just doesn't have the desire for it often. I've brought up the idea of some type of open relationship, and she is very against that.\n\nWhat do I do? I feel foolish to break up with her over sex, because everything else is really great. On the other hand, I think eventually this situation may breed resentment. This [comment] in DeadBedroom does not give me hope. \n\nAs a side note, I just discovered /r/DeadBedrooms/ just a few moments ago. It seems I'm not alone in my situation. That is both comforting and depressing.\nTL;DR:"}

If you want some background information to this, she is graduating next month and moving in with her parents in CT while looking for work in NY, and I'm a student in Philadelphia who will be studying in LA next year.  \nI ended the relationship because I felt that if I let it keep going it would just whither away and I really wanted to avoid that.  She is (was maybe) my best friend here at my university, and it's really hard not being able to talk to her, especially because we were together for so long that everything kind of reminds me of her.  I really want to just ask her how she's feeling, but I don't know the right time.  When we got back together after that two week stint, we were very civil.  Should I wait that long again? \n\nSome more information about the breakup: We talked for three hours before it was all over.  I ended the relationship after talking to her sort of out of the blue. (there was no fight or anything like that that led to this) There was some alcohol involved; this happened towards the end of a fundraising party at my house, however, I was planning to break up for a while.  \nInformation about the breakup for the two week thing: I just told her that I didn't think it was going to work and left.\n\nThanks for any help.\nTL;DR:"}

I do not have the funds for therapy yet but will be able to start in 2 months time.

I understand that it is a great personal blow and would greatly concern those around him to know that he would get back together with someone who could do something so hurtful to him. And I understand he does not want to experience that negative judgement and is afraid that if we break up in the future, he will look foolish. \n\nBut... I just cannot continue working on this relationship like this. We live together and are soon to move closer to our families and I want to be able to have that full honest relationship again.

Now we are together, and I never feel she cares about me enough. Never responds to my calls until the 3rd one, text messages are the same way.

Here's the story: I moved to Omaha, NE a few years ago and became involved in a local US Navy museum, Freedom Park. FP is nestled along the Missouri River and was flooded this past year when the infamous flood came along. Two of our biggest exhibits are a WWII minesweeper, the USS Hazard and the Cold War training sub, SST-1 the USS Marlin. A small group of volunteers (including myself) have been tasked with rebuilding the park, luckily with the assistance of the city to its former glory and hopefully better. This brings us to the rough part, and the part where in a way I must whore myself a bit. We are currently applying heavily for federal grants. We hope to build a web site and also set up a non-profit in the near future. Part of this process is also selling the need for the park to the City of Omaha. One thing that is helping in this process is the growth of the following to our existing page, www.facebook.com/freedompark. So, if any of you could help in any way, please, like our page!

As soon as she and her boyfriend would show up, I would get ditched in a corner while he talked almost exclusively to her.  I would try to involve myself in the conversations, but she would almost immediately shut me out.  A few times, I left to go to the restroom only to come back to him hugging her.  I talked to him about it and how that made me feel and, instead of changing his behavior, we stopped going to parties.\n\nNow we've been dating for almost three months and he's told me that he loves me and I really believe him and I love him back.  But I can't even go on Facebook without seeing comments he's made on her posts *while* we were hanging out and he's almost always texting her.  I'm trying to not let it bother me, but I've dated enough emotionally abusive assholes that I can't help but feel nervous about this.  I want to ask him if he's still hung upon her, but I don't want to cast doubt on our relationship so early.\nTL;DR:"}

For years, we've been talking mostly on messenger, but for the past few month, we've been meeting each other a lot face to face, and I've started developing some feeling for her. I talked to her about it and after some thought she said she would have gone for it (A relationship with me) if not for the distance.\nI respect that and I told her so, I felt really lousy being around her, so after a short while I told her it might be best that we won't meet or talk for a while... She seemed to take it really hard, crying and telling me if there's anything she can do to not stop talking. Telling me she'd rather have her house explode instead and that the only reason we aren't together is the distance. This conversation went on for a long time and because we both really didn't wan't to not to to each other...\n\nSo time passes and we're not talking even though I think about her every day... And after a few weeks I think I can handle her again, so I start talking to her on messenger and it's like nothing ever happened. But it took one meeting for all of my old feelings to come back, and for each meeting since, they grow stronger and stronger, and now it's not just 'having feelings' I've actually fallen in love with her...\n\nToday I wanted to talk to her about it, and maybe stop seeing her again, but I couldn't bring myself to speak, and now it seems like we won't see each other for a while and I'm stuck with this all to myself. (I really don't want to tell her over phone or something like that).\n\nSo what do you think reddit? I'm really confused and have no idea if this even has a chance, and I'd hate to stop being her friend but I don't know what to do. Any help or advice is really welcome.\nTL;DR:"}

My reasons are 1) you don't even know if we are dating bc you had to ask 2) it would be long distance and too much too handle 3) I just dove have the time to have one.  I need to focus on my self as college is for finding ones self.  \n  \nSo I am a senior in high school and she is a freshman in college an hour away. We have been dating for over a year now. Last week I was kind of confused when she told me she won't be able to communicate with me as much this semester because she has to study and she wants to be more social. So I just asked her if we are still dating then, because I was kind of confused that it sounded like she didn't have time for me. It really isn't that long distance, I can drive and see her easily, plus we skype all the time. I don't even know what to say about the last thing. She has to find herself?  \nI'm really not sure what to do now. Because I still really do like her, I almost told her I love her last time she was home a month ago.

I reciprocate...kind of. Something about it feels not quite like a \"click.\" It's like I'm publicly embarrassed by him - not as a friend, but imagining going out with him kind of raises my hackles. Additionally, there's another guy \"Alex\" who, while he has a girlfriend, I am attracted to and I don't feel like the embarrassment is an issue. What this secondary attraction makes me think is that pursuing this relationship with Matt is a bad idea; if I was really truly interested, I wouldn't have the reservations I do have.\n\nAnother worry of mine is sex. I'm still a virgin. Not for any particular reason other than that I haven't found someone that I feel comfortable enough with for that to happen. I've run into problems with guys before because they \"don't want to wait for me to be ready,\" in which case I'm like, \"Well, bummer for you. I'm going to when I'm ready.\" The thought of sex with Matt is also kind of hackle-raising, just that it makes me nervous. Not in an insecurity way, but like the idea of sex with him isn't appealing at all. When I consider the same situation with Alex, I don't have that feeling. Sex in general makes me feel uncomfortable, but I know that if I find someone who I'm with that really loves me for me, they won't care. \n\nDo I pursue this relationship with Matt, or do I trust my gut? If I trust my gut, how do I not obsess over the currently unavailable Alex? How do I let the idea of sex not bother me so much?\nTL;DR:"}

Since then I have realized, through texting/meeting briefly once by chance/ talking to friends that she is not very similar to me, and I would not like 'that' sort of relationship with her. The sorts of things are completely different music taste that she dislikes people without similar taste in bands (which as a big part of my life is genuinely a problem), she recently got a tattoo that I really dislike, she also just seems to disagree with me on just about every debatable issue (politics, god etc). I have made my decision, I do not want a sexual relationship with her.\nHowever, she is a mutual friend with lots of my friends, and from what I gather a very fragile/insecure person, so I need to think of a way to break it off that will upset her in the minimal way possible. I have been texting her to get to know her and have not yet expressed any of this. Tomorrow, as I agreed to do directly after hooking up, I am meeting with her, and  I plan to break it off in person. How should I do this? I have thought myself but everything seems like a shit cliche when it is true-- I genuinely would rather be friends and it genuinely is me not her. I am particularly worried that having me being interested in her and texting, asking to meet up just to u-turn is going to rub off badly on me. What should I say? Should I go to the whole date then say at the end? Another thing to note is that anything along the lines of I don't want a relationship right now would be a complete lie. Also if someone says cancel the date I would like a really good arguement for why as I feel that would be a cowardly and mean thing to do right now. This is my first time breaking up with someone.\nTL;DR:"}

I'll probably know this girl (let's call her A) for a total of two months and then I'll never see her again. \n\nI'm torn about hooking up with A.

We are confident that we're gonna spend our lives together, and it's wonderful, but I digress. \n\nShe just got a job recently, so she can fly out to visit me, which is lovely of her, however, I have this problem. Lately, she has been coming home from work hornier than I've ever seen her. I've asked her about this, and she says it's because she fantasizes about us banging to pass the time, which is an understandable reason. But she has done this in school, and just at home to pass the time, and she's never like this. So can you guys tell me, am I just overreacting, or is there maybe something going on?

Which is sort of a fuck up in its self.\n\nA tiny bit of background info, i am alone for the weekend and this happened last night, it may have been past midnight. So i went to the bathroom and out of habit i locked the door. I went into the shower and just showered like normal. When i was done and was going to walk back to my bedroom the door would not fucking unlock itself. The door was stuck, no matter how hard i tried turning the key the door would still be locked. I started having a panic attack and pulled all i could on the door, i also started kicking it and throwing shit around. At this point i thought my family would come back two days later and find me passed out and naked on the bathroom floor. Since i was alone and no one could help me i did not know what the actual fuck to do. Luckily for me our radio is broken, so the antenna was replaced with steel wire.

The camera takes such nice pictures, the size is so much smaller than my Note 2. After a few days of using the phone and realizing that my tiny hands aren't dropping it half as much as my old one I get a *great* idea guys. Its nudie time. I take about 40 pictures of me stripping, boob shots, ass shots, playing with my toys, anything I could think of to send to my boyfriend. \n\nWell about two weeks after sending the pictures it came time for D and I to move half way across the country. We packed up, D put a new ROM that worked on the HTC One and \"wiped\" it.\nNow I say that because we looked through the phone and nothing was there as far as we could tell.

She also says she doesn't want to have sex as often because she \"isn't as worried about me leaving her anymore\". The tipping point was tonight, she's out with her friends and I have been in a bad mood today(stress from school) and she told me she was gonna turn off her phone because she didn't want my mood ruining her night. \n\nWhen ever I bring this up to her she just gets pissed off and finds ways to make it sound like I'm trying to \"control her\".

He let his mom (My Grandma) borrow $45 from him when he was 17. Time went by and his mom never paid him back so he wrote a $45 check in her name and cashed it. She called the police on him and he spent 1 1/2 years in prison when he was 17 years old. After he got out he was a convicted felon. Fast forward to around 4 months ago, Him and I were shooting guns on county land where there are no houses. Someone called the cops and we talked to the cops for a good 3 hours. After that my mom came and picked me up and he got arrested for being a felon with a weapon. He was unaware that he was a felon because when he went to prison he was only 17, a minor. Yesterday was his court date and they want to give him 4 years probation or 18 months in prison. Apparently in Florida (Where we live) it doesn't matter if you are a minor or not, if you commit a felony you are a felon for the rest of your life. I don't know what to do. He has another appearance in September to see what he has to do. I'm 15 so I don't know much about this legal stuff but there is some smart people on Reddit and was wondering if any of you could help. We don't have that much money and my mom can't work.

I've asked girls out before, failed and moved-on, and then once got pretty close to having a relationship with someone, but this girl is the only one I know who has shown a genuine interest in me.

Today we were talking about it, and they asked me if I liked the new house better than the old one (we are renting right now), and in reality, I really missed our old house and liked it a lot more, but I knew that if I said that it would really hurt my dad because he's been working really hard with the business to make sure that I have a bright future.

We've been a couple since we were about 15 years old and have seldomly had rough patches in our relationship. \n\nSince a few months I've noticed that my feelings towards her have changed. Although it sounds clich\u00e9, the best way I could describe it right now is as if she were my best friend or even my sister, not my lover. We live in different cities and live very different lives at the moment; I'm pretty outgoing, like partying and love living the 'student life', whereas she's much more focused on her studies and rarely goes out at all.\n\nI know that I would live a really, really happy life if I would end up with her. Somehow I got the feeling that in the end we belong together, but I'm not sure if the relationship is working right now. When I told my gf about the way I felt she started crying and we agreed we would work on it together. It's been a few weeks since that moment and even though I know I can't force my feelings, I'm not feeling the same way about her as I used to.\n\nSince I've never had these doubts before, I guess I'm just wondering if any of you have gone through this same situation as I have and if you have any advice for me. Should I just wait and see if my feelings for her return or should I stop seeing her, for at least a while? This account is a throwaway since my gf is also on Reddit. I gotta say it feels good talking to you guys about this, I hope you can help me in any way whatsoever.\nTL;DR:"}

So later on, she took a couple of pictures of me eating and wanted to text them to my mom. At first I didn't give her the number (I guess b/c I'm an idiot) and then I finally relented. She had already pulled into herself and I kept trying to get her to talk but she wouldn't.

Occasionally I do zone out though or get caught up in my own train of thought while I'm with her (I mean who doesn't?), and the only explanation I can think of is that maybe I unconsciously do it while I'm not paying attention, because it's not like I purposely stare at other women to check them out all the time or anything.

This was topped off by the fact that my parents expected my to get all A's. This put a lot of stress on me during the school year, and I did not have much time. \n\nWell, my grandparents decided to visit, which was fine with me. They came over, and the visit went without incident the first couple of days. Afterwards, my grandmother (who got a Galaxy Note) asked me to put some pictures on her phone onto MY computer. She would then make me put it onto the USB. Not only that, but it was 11 o'clock, and I was still not halfway done with my homework. But she was my grandma, so I did it for her anyways. \n\nThis went on for a couple of days, she would ask me to upload her photos EVERY DAMN DAY, and I would do it for her. But one day I it got too far. Grandma couldn't find her USB cable, so I told her I couldn't put the pictures into the computer. She was very pissed, and told me that if I was considerate of \"anybody besides myself,\" I would go and look for it. I spent the next hour looking for it, and found it fallen under a desk. I put the pictures in, but then decided to do something else. I put another file into the pictures, a fork bomb, and named it a picture name. I changed the icon so it looked like a picture, and shoved it into the USB. \n\nSome time later, when my grandma was uploading a large number of pictures to a social networking site, she clicked on my file. It automatically started opening up command prompts, and she couldn't stop it. She started looking for me, but I escaped out the back door and \"went on a bike ride.\" The best part was, she had to upload every single picture again, because it was in a group of photos.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by getting caught with my pants down by a flight attendant.\nPOST: So this happened this morning. I was mid-way through a flight to California, and realized I needed to use the bathroom. It was a very early morning flight (arrived at 8:30), so I decided to freshen up a bit in the bathroom while I was there. I went to the bathroom at the back of the plane, combed my hair, and put on some cologne. I pulled down my jeans to use the toilet, when midway through piss, there was a loud dinging sound and pounding on the door. The lock on the door was undone from the outside, and before I had a chance to pull my pants up, one of the flight attendants wrenched the door open and came inside. At this point in time, I have no fucking clue whats going on. I'm struggling to pull my pants up as the flight attendant pushes me out of the door of the bathroom and starts looking around the bathroom. Another flight attendant comes up to me and ask if I have been smoking in the bathroom. Being a non-smoker, I say no. It is at this point that I begin to realize that the noise I heard before was the smoke detector going off. After completing her search of the bathroom and concluding that it neither smelled of cigarette smoke, nor were there any cigarette butts in the bathroom, the flight attendant explains what happened, passes it off as a malfunction, and lets me go back to doing my business. Not 20 seconds after stepping back into the bathroom, the same thing happens all over again, but this time I pulled my pants up in time. After talking for a solid ten minutes with the flight crew, we finally figured out what the issue was. The cologne I had just put on a few minutes ago was so potent, it was triggering the smoke detector. Lesson learned, don't use cologne on airplanes.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: How would you make communism work?\nPOST: Has anyone ever thought about a communist system that actually works?\n\nI understand the premise of communism vs capitalism and I think that while both systems have benefits and pitfalls, an 'ideal' form of communism would actually work better than our current 'capitalist' system.\n\nThe problem with traditional communism is the lack of incentives for more work vs less work. A farmer who makes more than he needs to gains no benefit vs a farmer who makes just enough to fill his quota. The farmer who made extra would feel cheated, and rightly so.\n\nWithout benchmarks or quotas for productivity the average worker produces just enough, or a little bit less than they are required to produce. The result is a system that doesn't expect, nor even suggests, the notion of a surplus.\n\nIdeally the improved yields from one farmer would ripple out towards the entire community and provide greater services (in this case, lets say wheat) for everyone. So if both the farmers from the original situation made just enough to fill their quotas, then their community would get the alloted 'credits' or what have you with reference to this. \n\nHowever, if one farmer produced more than he was required to, this change would be documented and the surplus would be applied evenly across the community. \n\nThis doesn't change the mindset to produce more for the sake of profit, but rather quality of life. If the farmers make more wheat then everyone in the town gets more wheat. This could even be magnified through the entire country, but if it was done in this way then nobody would truly notice the change, and then the original problem comes up again.\n\nThe ideal solution would be to create a form of friendly competition between communities. Communities would be rated based on their production and would recieve incentives based on their productivity. Not reaching quotas would be frowned upon, but wouldn't result in people starving. In fact, the large scale community would become more inclined to provide incentives to offset losses from weaker communities.\nTL;DR:"}

He claims he will do *anything* to keep me.\n\n* Me\n\nI am about to graduate from college.  I have definite plans for my future.  (According to my family and friends) I am an intelligent old soul.  I used to be incredibly social.  I used to have tons of friends.  I used to go out and do fun things.\n\n* Us\n\nWe've been together for 5 years.  Obviously we've been through wonderful times and incredibly rough patches.  Nothing out of the ordinary, really.  \n\nFor the last month, we've been in an emotional roller coaster.  I've been wanting to be by myself and take a break, but he refuses to accept that and said that we either try to fix our relationship while living together or it's over.  I don't know if I'm in love with him or if I just love him as a person(friend).  I know that relationships go through phases.  I wonder if I am still in love with him and it's just second nature to me, thus not frequenting my thoughts, or if I'm not in love with him anymore and that's why I don't think of it anymore.  I also find myself thinking of what it would be like to be single again and if it would be better than staying with him.  I don't want to lose him for nothing, but I also don't want to turn into a middle-aged woman that settled for a relationship because it was safe.\n\nThis situation has been running through my mind for a month now.  I am so mentally and emotionally exhausted... and I think anyone who reads this can tell, seeing as how I'm down to the bare minimum.\nTL;DR:"}

He is considerate, hard-working and the only real issue we have had became a non-issue after a good chat. But the current problem isn't something I can fix for him. \n\nAbout 6 months ago my boyfriend got handed an amazing career opportunity - a promotion to sales manager and then the huge leap to acting branch manager. It meant working from another state, but even travel is fine for us as he comes up almost every weekend and I often travel to his state for my job. \n\nBut right from the start of this promotion the CEO has handled things badly - my partner went from 0 direct reports to 16 with no training, the Operations Manager (usually a role supporting the Branch Manager) quit just before my partner moved into the role, they lost about 3 additional key members of staff and brought in someone who needed training from the, now non-existent, operations manager. My partner is doing the role of branch manager, operations manager AND sales manager! It's ridiculous! He works 12 hour days EVERY DAY! He has had to learn these two new management roles and the company is still looking to replace those other 3 key staff members...\n\nWe both keep hoping it will get easier after these new hires are made and as he gains more management practice. But these last two-three weeks he has just been so down... He has no enthusiasm for anything and becomes so distracted on Sundays when he starts thinking about the next week. \n\nI try to make things special and help make the time he has away from work fun and distracting, but I don't know what else I can do.\n\nLast night he seemed exceptionally quiet and distracted. Then when we were lying there is bed he rolled over, gave me a massive hug, choked up and told me he didn't want this job to break him. It completely broke my heart to hear. I replied as best I could, but what is there to say beyond validating someones feelings and letting them know you will support their decisions? \n\nShould I suggest he speak to someone? I would love any advice or suggestions from anyone at this point.\nTL;DR:"}

Although I had change in my pocket, I felt he would just use it for booze, so I said no.  He then offered to show me a magic trick and pulls out a deck of cards.  I tell him I am not interested and continue walking towards my destination.  He then said says, \"Just pick a card, any card.  Actually, don't pick out a card, just think of a card in your head and I will tell you what it is.\"  I had the ace of spades in my mind as that was the first thing that popped up.  Then I thought that was too easy so i changed my thoughts to queen of diamonds.  As soon as I change the card in my mind, the man blurts out, \"YOU WERE THINKING OF ACE OF SPADES AND YOU JUST CHANGED IT TO QUEEN OF DIAMONDS!!\".  I stopped dead in my tracks, emptied my pocket full of change to this man's hand and had a total look of shock on my face.  He then proceeds to do something more astonishing, he starts naming random facts about my life, all of which are entirely accurate and specific from the tattoos on my arm (I am wearing a long sleeve shirt and jacket by the way) down to things that have occurred during my childhood.  Keep in mind I have never seen this man before in my life.  I was in such shock that I didn't even think about asking how he was able to do that, I just walked back to work and thought about it the rest of the night about how this was even possible.\nTL;DR:"}

But I don't feel connected, always thinking that I kind of pretend to be a person, which I am actually not. \n\nA little bit to my personality: I am very good and fun in a large group of friends, but once you meet me alone, I get boring pretty fast. I think it's hard for a lot of people to just spend time with me alone. Especially because they assume that I am way more exciting, than I am, because they got to know me in a group where I am very open, outgoing and hyperactive. \nI also am diagnosed with ADD and have anxiety attacks, with kind of depression. \n\nThere are cases where I kind of fall in love with a girl, but this mostly one-sided and waaaaay to much. Like I feel anxious when this person is not around, jealousy and going crazy. Doesn't feel good. \n\nDo I just have to wait for the right person? Is it part of my development? I really wish to have a person with me, which finds me inspiring and I find her inspiring as well, easy to talk to and which makes me laugh. Sometimes I have the feeling that I had already to many girls, that nothing what I do is special anymore.\n\nIs that kind of love a 'lie' from televison? Am I just young and have enough time to find the right person? \n\nThanks for reading, I really hope this belongs here. I'm not a native speaker so please bare with my grammar mistakes. :)\nTL;DR:"}

He asks if I'm sure, if it wasn't next to some other tree or another street. I say I'm positive. He walks another block down and as the street ends, he turns right to keep going.

It has gotten to the point where she has actually sent me messages telling me how great of a guy he is, how much he cares, etc. On that note - I should add that the reasons I have been upset with him are due to him lying and seeing an ex girlfriend. From the sound of it, he doesn't reveal the whole truth when he vents and just makes it sound like he made a \"one time innocent mistake\" to gain pity or something. Either way, him venting to her is odd to me, and it feels like he's making me come off like a bad person. It's made me feel really embarrased whenever I've seen her, and I feel like she looks at me with this kind of \"she's a bitch for putting X through this\" glare.\n\nFemale 2 - Never met her, he just vents shit to her via email, text, whatever.

I have been using this to justify my cheating by telling myself that I never consented to a relationship. How do I fix this situation?\nPOST: First let me give some important background information:\n\nI met the guy I'm currently seeing two months ago. While I originally was interested in him only as a hook up, he clearly was looking more for long term. He's a very kind and fun person and so I've let things evolve to spending a lot of time together, going out for dinner, and more sex. In reality, what we have looks from the outside to be very much a relationship.\n\nThe problem is that I am terrified of relationships and exclusivity in general. My fear is that being tied down will result in me missing out on important experiences and meeting someone who potentially is a better match for me. Because he never once brought up any sort of talk about the future or established exclusivity, I assumed that I was still free to talk and date other people. However, the other day I was browsing Tinder and showed him a really cute girl I had been matched with (I'm bi), and he reacted very negatively. While I knew that he was definitely not seeing other girls (he's a bit old-fashioned), it was clear that he had expected monogamy on my side. Truth is, I've been continuing a friends-with-benefits relationship with someone else AND have been dating another guy. \n\nBecause he hadn't ever outright said that we're exclusive or asked me what I wanted, I use this to justify both my previous and current cheating. However, I know that I have gone out of my way to hide these other relationships from him and have been deceitful. I know it's wrong, but I cannot help but to feel justified and corned into a situation that I never wanted in the first place (in other words, it's not my fault he assumed). However, this cannot continue. I want to talk to him about it. \n\nSo Reddit, am I in the wrong for this - can exclusivity be assumed nowadays? And more importantly, when I talk to him about this, should I mention the other relationships or pretend these never happened (I don't want to hurt him)?\nTL;DR:"}

My aunt is his ride and die chick, she chooses him over everyone so I don't even understand why she would be invited. Don't even get me started on that part.  I reported him once already, and have to do it again because I found out he will be living with children. \n\nI asked her if he was coming and she said she's not sure now. She didn't pass out the invitation, and was pretty upset about it too that he might be there, but doesn't sound like she has enough balls to do anything about it.\n\nI feel like I don't want to attend the wedding now and see his face, but I also don't want to miss out on my cousins  wedding. How should I handle this?  Should I do an ultimatum? Should I just not show up to prove how serious I am about this? What do I say to my cousin?\nTL;DR:"}

I was frightened to tell him the news because I knew he would be happy to start our lives together as a family. This point in our lives is very hectic, and I don't want to bring our child into chaos. He or she should be brought into a stable, loving family where my husband and I are married, and most importantly, ready. I know it's my decision to keep our child or not, and I hate to do the latter. In fact, I really considered making it happen, and marrying him to make it a better environment for the baby; but after I told him I was getting an abortion (but still feeling very hesitant about it), he blew up, and broke up with me. \n\nI've put so much love and consideration into this relationship, only for him to tell me he was disgusted for me even considering that an option. I needed to know that I had his support no matter what happens, but now, even if I'm not pregnant, he refuses to talk to me still. I realize now that he'd rather have someone to pass on his genes, and will have nothing to do with someone who \"wanted to kill his child.\" Needless to say, this has me torn to pieces.\n\nShould I continue to try and salvage this relationship, even if I'm not pregnant? After what he's said to me, I don't feel he would care if I existed after this moment, so long as *his* child is safe.\n\nI hate the thought of abortion, but I'm just not sure what's going to happen at this point.\nTL;DR:"}

He was really frustrated by that and said that it is not fair. He suggests, I should work on my insecurities, because it will make me more free and happy. I don't think it can happen in foreseeable future, and for now it can only destroy my self-confidence. If I let him do it, I will most likely feel unsexy for him.

All majors at my college take a Senior Seminar class in which they are supposed to examine the ethics/purpose of their major.\n\nMy class takes the following format: We spend half the time doing a book discussion on \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,\" and the second half of the class doing small presentations to the class on something we find interesting related to our major. So for example, I am going to be giving a short presentation on functional programming for my class this week.\n\nAnyhoo, I realized that there are going to be a few extra slots for presentations that are going to be left over after everyone does their required presentation, and I though that it would be fun if I could do an extra one that consisted of having my class play games. My first thought was something to do with examining the formal systems that underpin some of my favorite card/board games (such as Settlers/Dominion/Bang!). Then I realized: Hey, what about Portal!\n\nI asked my professor, and he said if that I could sufficiently link Portal to mathematics, computer science, and/or GEB, he would give me the green light for having one of our class periods be a big portal party.\n\nSo I need help fully fleshing out this concept. My focus is on linking Portal to Escher in the context of the ideas that Hofstadter raises in GEB. Does anyone have any good input? Btw, this class is can get rather philosophical, so the connections don't have concrete, so much as parallel and thought provoking.\nTL;DR:"}

Honestly, my eyes just glaze over societal topics that are posted to reddit. I do realize that this is not good, however.\n\nA few weeks ago, I watched a documentary called The One Percent. I'm not linking to it because it wasn't actually very well done, though the subject matter was interesting. It concerns the super wealthy of America, and was directed by one of the heirs to the Johnson and Johnson fortune.\n\nHere is my simple conclusion after watching the doc. Please tell me what may be flawed about my line of thinking:\n\nIf any one person or small group of people are becoming disproportionately wealthy through their business, then doesn't that directly imply at least one of the following:\n\n-They are charging too much for their products or services.\n\n-Employees lower on the totem pole are not being paid enough. \n\nI don't necessarily think we should tax the super rich to death, but what if businesses were just regulated more so that products/services were cheaper and profits were divided more equally?\n\nThe higher-ups could still earn a lot more than the lower-downs, but just taken down a notch or two. In theory, could a system work where we put a cap on wealth? How is it possibly good or justifiable for any one person to have more than a billion dollars to his or her name?\nTL;DR:"}

We really enjoy spending time together and have really clicked. \n\nUnfortunately, the treatment of depression is a process and as such there will still be those days where it seems like even getting out of the bed is impossible. Yesterday we were together, talking and making out when mid-kiss she pulls back and asks \"Is everything alright, you usually seem more into it\". Now decreased libido and energy are both aspects of my depression and part of me wanted to tell her.

Also, when I don't respond, she will create social media accounts to try and add me and talk to me.\n\nNow, I know I should've blocked contact awhile ago, but I feel bad for her. She's from another country, hasn't lived with her family since she was 14 (went to a private boarding school in said country), then came to the states for university. She has no family here, but an aunt, and no real friends to speak of, which is why she's so clingy. She is also losing her job(she's an engineer), and she is currently planning on marrying someone for citizenship (after she asked me, to which I declined, even though she was offering $50k). This is basically what she talks to me about 24/7 (that and how she wants to hang out, even though I haven't seen her in months). She is so desperate to stay in America it's pathetic, but maybe I don't understand where she's coming from. She's from a wealthy country, she just refuses to go back to where she's from and talks about how her life is hell? So basically our convos consist of her talking to me like we're dating, her telling me about her plight to stay in America, and her acting crazy when I don't respond.\n\nNormally, I could be friends with someone after dating, seriously or not.

I talked about flings and flirting with girls (which was hypothetical).\n\nThis happened most recently when we were fighting because she was flirty texting another guy.  I know we sound like children.  I don't even really understand why I posted it, I suppose it was a way to get back at her or to think about it intellectually or just make myself feel more confident. I always tell myself I want to be constantly learning to be a better partner and know her better, but man did I fuck up.\n\nThe first time was 8 months ago or so and that, on top of other issues, lead to us splitting for a month and then getting back together, but it was full of turmoil for a while.  This lead to her texting other dudes and making me feel like she didn't care about me.  But we talked and she made a real change.  Things have been going really well until she saw that post (it's a few weeks old now).\n\nI feel terribly that I did this to her. I do love her, but I don't think she will ever trust me again.

I decide to let her cool off a little before she tells me that she's suspended from work and probably getting fired from her awful retail job because of a technicality, one that her manager was instructing everyone to do as well.\n\nSo today as normal I wake up when she decided to go to the gym, and I get a text about noon saying that her work wanted her to come in and I said okay, keep me updated. About 4 hours ago I got an e-mail from her saying that she did indeed get fired from her job, but she had a panic attack outside the store and they ended up taking her to the hospital. I had been trying to get a hold of her constantly since then with no success until about 30 minutes ago when I get a text from her sister saying she's on 72 hour watch at the hospital, and unfortunately I won't even be able to visit her because I'm not family. I know I can just wait but I'm frantic and I haven't had any contact with her since her e-mail. I've tried contact the hospital but they keep giving me a runaround transferring me to different departments and putting me on hold. Is there anything I can do besides waiting 72 hours?\nTL;DR:"}

Well I turn 18 in less than 3 months, and my parents and I have spoken with oral surgeons and other dental professionals, turns out my teeth are too close together in that area and there are only two actual options. Option 1. Getting braces/invisiline for a year and then getting the bone graft and implant, this would also fix other problems in my mouth, the crowding i have on my bottom row of teeth being one of them. Personally I want to go with this option, as i see it would be better in the long run, because not only do I end up having a more stable tooth in that spot, I'd have a better smile altogether since it would fix other problems. Option 2: Getting a bridge, specifically a [Maryland Bridge] to insert a fake tooth into that place, bind it to the nearby teeth and call it a day. Sadly these bridges don't last as long compared to the implant and they are significantly less stable. My mother wants to go this route because she primarily cares about the financial aspect. My family and I wouldn't be able to afford the better option, or maybe we would in a year if i picked up more hours at my job. I don't know.

I went to a party on Saturday night (today is Wednesday). I went with 4 of my boys and did not know anyone there other than my buddies. So, one of my friends (we'll call him Jim) and I were interested in two girls. The girls were the party host and her best friend. We chilled and talked with them all night, my buddy and his girl made out a lot and even ended up having sex. My girl and I just talked, which was great because she was a great talker and very smart! We stayed there until 7am the next morning before having to leave due to work. I felt a real connection to my girl and I have been in love with her since the party but there are a few problems:\n\n1) She has a boyfriend\n2) Her boyfriend does a lot of bad shit to her (I want to help her with this)\n3) She's the complete opposite of me; I'm a \"good guy\" and she's a \"bad girl\". By that, I mean I don't do illegal shit and she does. \n\nI don't know what it is that made me love this girl but now I can't stop thinking about her. I've never been attracted to a girl as much as I have with her. I text her every now and then and we talk for a bit, but the replies are really slow. She told me I'm really nice at the party and that she wanted to be friends even after the party, but I don't know what to do now. I can never picture myself being with her unless she changes her ways and stops doing most, if not all, of the bad shit she does. Hey, the quote *\"good girls and no fun and fun girls and no good\"* is applying here. But I feel like I love her so much cause she's the complete opposite of me and \"opposites attract\".\nTL;DR:"}

One of our friends lives right up the street with his parents and drinks very seldom. He never drank throughout high school, was a perfect kid, all that shit. So his parents haven't really been introduced to the fact that their children tend to do \"bad\" things every now and then. They still control his life at almost 20 years old. Since he lives right up the street and our parties are crowded sometimes, he went home a couple times after drinking/smoking. The first time, his parents caught him drunk and throwing up on their rug. The second time, his parents caught him blazed. Now, they force him to come home at around 12:30-1am and occasionally wait up for him. Last night he drank way too much, and got caught throwing up on the exact same rug. We do not want to be blamed for his stupidity (namely: not knowing his limits, letting himself be peer pressured into drinking more than he can handle, not being able to handle his shit with his parents, etc...) since we are all 19 and 20 and there could potentially be legal trouble involved since we are underage. What rules can we lay down to prevent shit like this from happening again? And what are some more rules that are staples for party venues?\nTL;DR:"}

Her roommate says she won't stop talking about me and I'm into her. No problem, right?\n\nThe trouble is that she's really different from other girls I've dated. We're both studying sciences and talk about cosmology, data systems, electronics, stuff like that. Which is awesome, but at the same time it's making it really difficult to romanticize things. Say what you will about the beauty of nature, its discovery is a heartless, analytical slog.\n\nWe're also both terrifically afflicted with the typical lack of social awareness; if I'm catching hints from her, it's probably obvious from across the room to everyone else. Somehow an abundance of stuff to talk about doesn't make talking any less anxiety-inducing for me, and probably for her.\n\nSo I'm somewhat confounded on how to ask her on a date and where to go. We're both broke college students, ruling out pretty much anything that costs money. When you're already dating there's that mutual understanding that you're both broke and you're just gonna do broke people stuff, but I can hardly ask her if she wants to come over and watch Netflix as a first date.\n\nSomeone I tutor said they can lend me a you-and-a-friend pass for the Exploratorium (science museum in San Francisco) but that's almost an hour away. I've never gone anywhere near that far for a date, much less a first one. If you all think it's more plausible than I do, let me know.\n\nSo as you can tell I'm new to dating in college. Am I supposed to somehow circumvent the literal \"dating\" and just go straight to \"being in a relationship?\" Is there some kind of nerdy broke guy secret to romanticism? In terms of game theory I've certainly got the upper hand, but I'm not sure how to play it.\n\nHelp me out, hivemind.\nTL;DR:"}

Not the diner kind, but the one that closes up again after you squirted some of the ketchup out, presumably to form a seal to prevent contamination or something. So, I'd say, this took place sometime around 2000. \n\nSo, I was opening this new bottle and had just removed the little plastic foil under the cap, screwing the cap on again. I remember distinctly that it was one of the hotter variants of Heinz. I was intrigued by the new cap and, pressing the bottle slightly while it was sitting on the table, I hovered over it to see how a little ketchup gets squeezed out. I didn't even lower my head much, I was hovering at maybe 30 cms from bottle to face, looking down.\n\nTurns out, you have to put a little energy in to open up the \"valve\",  meaning the experience was a lot more \"binary\" than I expected. Nothing was happening, so I squeezed a bit harder.\n\nThis is when I basically got hit in the eye by quite the stream of hot ketchup.\n\nAnd it burned. How it burned. The pain.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't necessarily think it's the commitment that scares me as I like the idea of settling down, but the fact that I've acted out on these urges rather than just fighting them makes me disappointed in myself and upset because my girlfriend doesn't deserve this. \n\nUltimately, it would be nice to hear any opinions on this I guess, maybe hearing from people who were in similar situations would be nice too. Should I end it or should I consider something else?\nTL;DR:"}

I firted but nothing crazy. Then today, her boss told me that she has a huge crush on me. She was calling her friends when she found out I was a big LOTR fan (she is too. Fucking awesome), and was hoping to maybe try dating. But recently (after me ignoring her advances) decided that its just a crush and she will get over it.

She knows shes a few years older than you\".\n\nShe turns 22 in a few weeks. So here is my dilemma... I decided I like this girl enough to risk some awkward encounters at work. But I dont want to ask her out, only to admit I lied to her. Also, I dont want to go out and have her decide that me being a year younger than she thought is a deal breaker.\n\nHer brother was in my grade, and she knows that.

Then about 3 months ago the tooth-pain kicked in... and it had been a decade since I last went to the dentist. That took a huge chunk of our emergency fund and will continue to be an expense for the next 9 months or so. Total dental expenses over the 12 month period are expected to be roughly $10,000. It never fully exhasted our emergency fund, but we were maintaining about a 3-month fund that was growing slowly due to recurring dental expenses.\n\nSunday while we were out of state our car died. We limped it back home yesterday, but it's not worth repairing considering its age and miles. So today we went car shopping. Got offered 0% and $0 down if we bought a 2016 Elantra -- we were originally looking at used cars, but that 10 year/100k mile warrany is just too appealing after being stuck in the middle of the road too often this last year.\n\nThey showed us different payment options and, man, does a down payment make a big difference. So our emergency fund is down to 1 month, with the hopes that it will pay off in the long run. That 0% interest, though... it was hard to ignore. We have a strong support system (live near lots of family more than eager to help out if something were to happen), but I feel bad going this low on the e-fund.\n\nI feel like that was a bad move, but it shouldn't take us long to build up an e-fund again. We're good at tightening our belts. Just in case anyone is interested, my job has fantastic retirement so it isn't like this is getting in the way of that.\nTL;DR:"}

However, the more time I spend with him the more I realise he is weirdly attached to his family, especially his mother. \n\nHe still lives with both his parents, his mother gives him a lift to work in the morning and she manages his appointments for him, cleans his bathroom, washes his clothes and cooks for him. He doesn't pay any rent (in spite of him having a really well paid job at an investment bank) and instead spends most of his money on weed. His parents have even built an extension at the back of their house solely for he and his brother (both stoners) to smoke in.\n\nHe spends a lot of social time with his parents as well and they text each other all day when they're not together, which again I think is sweet but they are SO close that I find it unsettling. They both treat him like a child in spite of the fact that he's almost 30. I've talked to him about his future plans because I really love him and care for him but he's insisting he never wants to leave home!

Apparently the exact same phrasing that she used was the same as a Wiki article, and the professor thought that she copied her answer directly from the article. Without discussing the situation with my sister, the professor contacted the dean and other heads of the history department and told them that my sister plagiarized. The prof. then sent an email to my sister telling her what she had done and said that she could have given her a warning, but didn't, and that this would be on her permanent record. My sister started freaking out (crying and calling everyone on what to do-she's pretty emotional) and emailed the professor back with the section of the book that she got the answer from. The professor then realized her mistake and simply said, \"I'm sorry, I realize now that I was mistaken. I will email the department heads and tell them to retract any punishment.\" I'm pretty pissed off at how the professor handled the situation and her half-assed apology.

For the past 10 years since my granddad died, it has been them 2 living alone in the house. My uncle is slightly odd - 60 years old, never had a girlfriend, never been married, lived with his mum his whole life, whereas his brother took the normal route in getting a wife and a family etc. Me and my family are always wondering why he doesn't get himself a girlfriend or something but we just conclude that he seems fine as he is as a single man with no kids, but he is the best uncle ever.\n\nOk, so to the TIFU. A few weeks back I was visiting my grandma as I live in a different city so I don't see her that much anymore. I came for lunch, and just like in my childhood, she told me to go to the living room and watch tv while she finished cooking. As an old woman, she gets really stressed about everything having to be perfect so had been cooking for me since the early morning, bless her. Anyway, I sit on the sofa and switch the tv on, and the tv comes on with a blank screen and the channel on the top of the screen. It was 'Adult BabeStation 1' or something along those lines. I cringed slightly as it meant someone in this house had last been watching this sex channel, which only played from midnight until 5am. Obviously it was my uncle, who has been there for me for years, but I can't look at him the same way again as I can just imagine him in the living room, my grandma asleep upstairs at 2am getting some pleasure. We're still wondering why he won't get a girlfriend.\nTL;DR:"}

My now ex girlfriend lives some 130 km (80 miles) away, so we visited each other each Friday to Sunday. She came here two weeks ago, so I changed the bedsheets on Thursday. I hadn't used those sheets for almost a year, when I was still living with my last girlfriend. I didn't even think about it and slept happily in those sheets that night.\n\nThe next day my girlfriend arrives, I pick her up, we have dinner, talk a bit and go to bed at night. Action begins, when she suddenly stops and pulls a long, blonde hair from my crotch (she has short, dark hair). I only say \"Where the hell did that come from?\" and don't waste a second thought about it. Action continues.\n\nAfter leaving that Sunday, she begins to behave distantly, doesn't answer messages for hours and says she has a lot of work, so she can't join me next (that is, last) weekend on a little trip to visit some friends (first weekend we didn't spend together). I played along till Friday, when her answers began to get truly short. So I didn't message her until she wrote me on Sunday evening. \n\nOf course I noticed that something was odd, and when she wrote that she preferred to come here instead of me visiting her, I knew what would happen. So this afternoon she arrives in my town, we sit on a bench and she says that this isn't working, that we have differences, that we should split. She also brings up the hair in my crotch, suggesting that I was being unfaithful. I was baffled: That stupid hair hadn't been on my mind for two weeks and suddenly it is the main reason why we're splitting up. I tried explaining, but heck, *I'd* probably think the same were it the other way round.\n\nAnyway, I told the girl that I was ok with splitting up, because it's true, we're very different on many levels; but that she please should not think it was because I slept with another girl.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: True Cost of Purchasing a Car: New Vs. Used\nPOST: The prevailing wisdom on this subreddit is that you should look for a 3-5 year old car instead of a new one.  I'm trying to help my girlfriend navigate the prospect of buying a car soon.  As an example, she's looking for a Honda CR-V.  [KBB] shows a new 2013 CR-V can be had for $22,400.  Let's say she would consider a 3 year old model with 36000 miles.  [KBB] has this for roughly $17000 from a private party seller.  \n\nIs $5400 really too expensive to have a solid, warranty-backed, car for 3 years, at the end of which time, you know the previous owner(you) took care of the vehicle and it will hold up?  I was always led to believe the discount for buying an older car was larger.  With the uncertainties of the previous owner(s) and issues they may try to hide, is it really that much better of a deal to buy used?\n\nAnother cost that seems dubious is the tax and other fees?  How does all of this work?  I seem to remember hearing there were tax advantages to buying form a dealer.  If I sell a car privately, do I pay tax on that as income?  Is there any tax-advantage to going through a dealer, assuming you get a reasonable trade-in value, to unload your previous car?  Say the car I want costs 22k and my trade-in is valued at 5k, do I only pay 17k in tax on the car if I do a trade-in, where-as I would be responsible for tax on the full price of the car in a private-party situation?  \n\nLike I said, I've priced out the rough difference of the new vs. 3-year-old model on KBB, but I'm wondering how the other fees, like tax, title, tags, etc. may vary between a private party and dealer purchase.\n\nIf you know of any other costs that I'm not aware of, please let me know.  Thanks!!!\nTL;DR:"}

I do NOT believe that a relationship can be full when/if someone cheats.

She want to expierence if she missed me after a week or two or if its all neutral. She feels numb. (about everything)\n\nWe talked a lot yesterday and i told her, that I put a lot effort in the last few weeks in our realtionship, but also feel that i'm not receving the attention from her i should deserve. And she realized it too. When we hung out. everything was fine. we made love and had a good time. but when she was at home / with her friends out or by herself she didn't waste her time with me. ((texting or something else) and NO I'm not herassing her or sending her texts every hour.)\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nnow, the morning after. I'm the one who feels numb. Tonight i will meet my best friend and will talk about it.. But i could use some advice from internet strangers too. What do you recommend me? Should I wait until she come back to me or should i cancel the whole story in my head and go on? Personally I'm still loving her and yes. I'm confused.\nTL;DR:"}

Pretty much everyone was having a good time. The girls there were all dressed up to the top, a little tipsy and overly friendly. \n\nExcept for one. And for some stupid reason she caught my eye. She was sitting under a tree reading a book (at a music festival) and her friends were trying to get her to stand up and dance. \n\nWhen she got up she just stood there laughing at her friends and she had the most incredible smile. Unlike everyone else there, she had jeans and a simple nerdy/funny shirt on (this is important later) \n\nI couldn't help myself so I walked up to her and said hi. She froze... she got scared (I don't think I look scary ?) and just sort of hid behind her friends. Her friends were incredibly friendly and we started talking but I really just wanted to talk to her and she wouldn't even tell me her name. I asked her friends if she had a boyfriend and they laughed and said maybe in another lifetime. Apparently she can't really talk to guys and it wasn't personal. She did end up being less hostile to me after spending some time with her friends and shes really interesting. Shes a pantheist and has these philosophical theories and ideas that Ive never heard from anyone our age before. \n\nNow the other day I was at the campus library when I saw her. at first I wasn't sure but then I saw her shirt yep its the same shirt. \n\nI really want to talk to her.

Karen always told me Danica had some feelings for me and flirted with me.  I knew it was there but I chose to ignore and deny.  \n\nOne night, Danica calls my phone blasting the \"I don't like your girlfriend\" song by Avril Lavigne.  It's late at night but I was up studying and Karen just crawled in bed next to me and heard the song through the speaker because I had to pull the phone away from my ear since it was so loud.\n\nA couple days later, I confronted Danica about this and she stated it was a joke and she apologized.  We ended up not very much talking for a few months afterwards.  \n\nTime went by, I randomly texted Danica to see how she was and what she was up to.  She asked who it was.  Come to find out, she deleted my number and said she decided it would just be easier on me since she knew every time Karen and I brought Danica's name up, it resulted in an argument. I insisted we stay friends no matter what and I'll just deal with Karen's getting upset.\n\nSeveral months later, still very little talking going on, I moved out of state for a semester of school and Karen stayed back home.  On a road trip out to California (where I was flying to school from) Karen and I found out she is pregnant. Woo!\n\nA week or 2 later, I'm in school and start talking to Danica again, mostly texting.  I bring this up to Karen, she begins to get upset again, ignored me all yesterday, and is now making me choose between being with her or staying friends with Danica.\n\nI love Karen and our bundle on the way, but it's still hard to give up a 10 year friendship.  \n\nAny similar experiences and/or advice?\nTL;DR:"}

We met in college, we knew we liked each other, and started talking and hanging out a lot for a little over 3 months before that, until we started actually dating. \n\nNow I was a freshman in college, he was a couple grades above me, and I didn't really have a substantial past with guys before him, I never slept with anyone else or really even came close to that. I wanted to wait until I found someone I really cared about first. Now that we are dating, we couldn't be happier, more in love, and we have great communication. It seems like our relationship keeps getting better, and we really have been great for each other. He tells me that ever since he met me everything has changed, that he's a better person and that there's no one that has ever made him feel this strongly about someone, and I have to agree that he is the same way for me. \n\nThe only thing that slightly gets me still is the fact that he used to hook up with a certain few girls, and they keep popping up. I will see them at parties, or they will come in conversations and jokes are made by his friends, etc, and I don't know, I just get slightly angry when I have to think about them and hear about them all of the time. I feel slightly jealous, and I think it's because he means a lot to me. A couple of them have even said bad things to me now that I'm dating him. I know it is in the past, but I can't seem to fully let it go? I mean some of them have to do with me, some of them he did hook up with before we were dating but when we were building our relationship (when we liked each other and hung out), and didn't mention them on purpose to me back then. It in no way has effected our relationship itself, but I still have thoughts and feelings about his past that has to do with me.\nTL;DR:"}

I thought that was a bit weird, but adjusted my clock to the proper time, 11:45, and kept going. I finally made it and found a spot when I looked at my phone, which said 10:50 then.

Upon check in, we decided to crack open a bottle of Fireball (mistake one) to catch a little buzz before we went out to the bars. About an hour in, we decided to venture out to the streets of Philly. Being a mile away from Old City, we decided walking would not be an issue. Now at this point I am NOT drunk, I do have a buzz, but by no means was I hammered. Me being familiar with the city, I thought I'd be the \"tour guide\" for my friends and lead the pack. Along our travels, I decided to snap a picture to cherish the moment. Then I realized I am no longer leading the pack. Me being the hot shot that I am, decide to get a nice jog going so I can catch up with my buddies. But wait, they are stopped at the intersection, they must realize they fucked up by not waiting for me. Suddenly there I am, right at the intersection, ecstatic to get this night rolling. Still in a mid jog, I belch out in excitement \"Let's go!!!\". This is where I fuck up. I check my 2 o'clock, and I notice that two taxis are stopped, I look to my left, and I see no cars coming. Great, coast is clear. I take one step in the road, and for some weird reason I notice a light closing in on my right, BAM! I was smoked by a fucking taxi. Luckily I only suffered minor injuries, and I understand how bad it could have been, but fortunately for me this turned into a life lesson.

I really wish he would have given me another chance after talking to me about this, because it made me more aware of the problem. I want to change and get better, and admittedly part of that is because of him, but it's also because I need to start looking at jobs, and being happy and perky and that's tough to do at the moment, well tough to be sincere about it. I just feel really bad but I don't want to be happy aside from getting a job. I kind of like being miserable because I was a crappy girlfriend to a wonderful man. I honestly wish I never met him because I know I'm always gonna be in love with him and it sucks. Even if I get happy I'm not gonna get over him. We were good together, but I just didn't appreciate it and it's probably done for good now.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [19F] am moving in with my SO [22M] of 8 months and his sister [19F]. How do I break the news to my conservative parents?\nPOST: My SO and I have been together for about 8 months now. We had talked about moving in together before we were dating and have the logistics of moving pretty much figured out. \n\nRecently, his sister decided that she wants to move out of her dad's place and asked if she could room with us. Being a poor college student, I of course okayed the whole thing. We all get along great and are really excited for the move. I am very confident in my decision and we are all prepared for the worst just in case one of us loses our job, we break up, etc.\n\nNow here's the problem: my parents are very conservative Mormons and like to get involved in big changes in my life. I'm transferring schools so they know that I've been looking for an apartment. Going to school full time and working part time means that I need roommates, and finding a place with the SO's sister came up casually in conversation. They were really concerned that this would ruin the rest of my life. I'm sure if I told them the SO is going to be sharing a bed with me, they would freak.\n\nI am not financially dependent on them and aside from birthdays and questions about mundane things like recipes and taxes, we hardly ever communicate. They were of the philosophy that I should move out right after HS and support myself from then on. Part of me knew that this freak out was inevitable despite the fact that it really is of no concern to them. However, I was really hoping that they would speak rationally and take some time to listen to my plan.\n\nI'm wondering how to let my parents know that I am capable of planning ahead and thinking responsibly. I know that they won't be happy but I want them to see that my SO and his sister are really great people and that I'm trying to do the best that I can. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

Well, the DJ starts talking about a bar special that happens every wednesday when they lower domestic beer to .25 cents a bottle.  He then goes on to say that all those people that have trouble with women should come out. He says that its \"simple.\"   Just to buy them a lot of drinks and they will do what you want.  This DJ even goes as far to say that \"Sure they might feel bad in the morning, but you'll feel great.\"  This struck me as something that shouldn't be promoted on air to listeners.  It was pretty much an advertisement to a bar that over serves individuals and men that attempt to get girls so drunk they can have their way regardless of consequences.  To be clear, I am a male with a fiance and a daughter.  His casual tone just pissed me off.  What say you Reddit?\nTL;DR:"}

This family member was not related to me genetically. I had a two-mom household; three kids from my blood-related mom and two from the other. Only one of the other mom- we'll call her Momfriend-'s kids lived with us, and he was the offender.\n\nThis long string of molestation happened after another, more isolated event. When he was 15, Momfriend and my mom were out for some reason- I dunno, groceries or errands or something- and he was left alone with us three. The three being my mom's kids, me, who was 7 at the time; my brother, who was 10 at the time; and my sister, who was maybe two or three at the time. Essentially, he locked my brother and I in the parents' room, laid on me, us both quite naked, and made my brother watch, also naked.\n\nWhen my parents got back, I reported the event to my mom. She, quite understandably, freaked out, and told Momfriend, who didn't believe her, saying I 'made it up'. My mom got him to confess, but only then did Momfriend actually believe her son had done that. They both took measures to prevent it in the future, but it didn't work as you can tell by the title.\n\nKay backstory over.\n\nThe ongoing string happened when Momfriend's son was 17 and when I was nine. I'll admit the 'year' is an estimation, and it's probably more than it actually is because traumatic experiences tend to last longer to your brain than they actually do.\nI'd only confessed this ongoing event to my mom quite recently, and this was after she and Momfriend had broken up. We plan to sue her son for damages (any advice on that would be appreciated).\nTL;DR:"}

So now I'm here at 8 in the morning, hoping she'll text me back or something. I know, I'm a huge pussy and dumbass for trying to be quick about it in the first place.

My brother and I were mainly raised by my dad. I have no memories of mum and dad together. We didn't start seeing her regularly for a while, and even then it was every other weekend.\n\nWhen I was Age 7 my dad remarried, and we all moved in with her and her 2 kids. I was excited about getting someone to do mum things with. She was horrible and treated us different to her children. I became depressed and sad. Age 15 I moved into my mums.\n\nMy depression was extremely hard to deal with. This made me a moody and isolated teenager. I did some stupid stuff and overdosed and ran away. Mum had no sympathy. She told me I was stupid and making it up, how could I be so selfish. She was gonna send me back to my dads if I didn't behave myself. I was grounded for months.\n\nAge 17 I got a boyfriend and finally found some happiness. I only stayed at home once or twice a week and eventually moved out at 18.\n\nI'm now 20, and I live with my boyfriend and his parents. I am loved and feel like I belong in a family. But I hear my mum is resentful and jealous that I get along with my mother in law better then her. She thinks I've replaced her. My past haunts me and I'm still getting periods of depression. \n\nI love my mum, I won't deny I resent her for not being there for me. I'm most hurt she didn't help me when I was depressed. She won't contact me, she won't talk about the past, I don't remember her really hugging or kissing me or telling me she loves me.... But my grandmother tells me she's hurt that I won't contact her. \n\nWhat can I do to bond with my mum? Why doesn't she love me or try to get close to me? I'm going to Australia in march for a year and I want to make up with her but I get a shaky voice and cry whenever I talk about the past. I can't talk to her without hurting, but the guilt is unbearable. Please help me!\nTL;DR:"}

Backstory: I travel a lot for work, I spend a few months at a time in various places. Met this guy, we hit it off really well, but once I told him I was leaving in a few weeks it kinda went south. His logic is that he's had previous lovers leave before and it's hard on him so he didn't want to continue while I was still in town.\nWhich I totally get. But he doesn't even want to meet in person to say goodbye. There were a few instances of performance based problems in the bedroom (which I could care less about), so I figured that might be part of it but my instinct is he was simply seeing someone else and this was an easy cop out. At one point during one of those unfortunate incidences he blurts out that he was with someone else the night before and though nothing happened he felt bad about it... I just think it's kind of odd. It's very likely that I'll end up here again next year, and he said he wants to keep in touch, but I don't know. I feel like I'm being naive here.\nTL;DR:"}

Should I let her give up?\nPOST: At the end of April my mom complained to my sister of stomach pains. My sister took her to the hospital, where they determined she was septic, possibly suffering from C Diff, and had an unknown clotting somewhere. Liver scan came back negative, they performed exploratory surgery to determine if she had dead bowel to no avail, and her blood pressure plummeted along with other vitals.\n\nFast forward a week and a different hospital, we find out she had DIC, she's no longer septic, she's off the ventilator, and she's stable; however, her hands and feet have become mummified. She will at least have to have her hands at the wrist amputated and her legs below her knees amputated.   \n\nMy mother loved gardening, sewing, walking, and holding her grandchildren. She loved working and loved people. The internist told me they can't let her end treatment while the possibility of her not making rational decisions is present (basically while in intensive care), but did tell me she advises families to consider quality of life moving forward, and that afterward she can stop treatment at any time.\n\n \nI am the youngest of five. My mother can speak in a raspy whisper and told me she wants to go home and die in bed with her dogs. I do not think she will be happy assuming the next year of treatment, surgery, recovery, and rehab goes by without her catching an infection. We will have to sell her house and move her in to a nursing home where she won't be able to do anything she loves. I think she would be miserable.  \n\n What do I do?

Apart from the ruined bumper, my car didn't seem to suffer any damage.\n\nHere is the part where I become an idiot.  I am drunk/high and do not want to deal with police.  My friend's brother has previous DUI's as well as two kids from different mothers (that, for the most part, my friend primarily raises), and I don't want to play a role in my friend's nephews having to deal with their father being in jail.  I talk to my friend and with my friend's parents, and they all verbally agree to replace the bumper if I do not call the police on the brother.  I agreed to this and do not report anything.\n\nFlash forward a few months.  The brother has been difficult to deal with and apprehensive about replacing the bumper.  I am preparing to move from Mississippi to North Carolina and want my bumper fixed beforehand.  My friend's family owns a mechanic shop where the brother works.  He finally tells me to drop my car off and he will replace the bumper before I move.  Well, it is now five days before I move, and I recently found out that my friend's brother has just let my car sit in the garage for nearly two weeks without even attempting to fix it.  I'm assuming he is just waiting for me to move and hoping I drop it.  The brother doesn't respond to my messages, and my friend says it is not his responsibility to make sure it gets fixed anymore.

You're *just* in another relationship, and you're *already* flirting with other guys? I know, she's my ex, I shouldn't give a rat's ass what she's doing now. But... I can't help it. I'm just way too curious to *not* find out what's going on in her head right now. I'm in no way jealous or anything (although I am offended she would go for someone close to me like my brother's friend and **NOT** expect news to reach me), I'm just *amazed* to the point where I'm baffled. At least when people cheat, they take a while before they eventually cheat/leave each other. But she just goes in right for the kill pretty much instantly. She ain't my problem anymore, she's the poor OM's problem to deal with. I legitimately am just trying to understand what her deal is. Can anybody explain why she's doing what she's doing? Is there like a term for people like this?\nTL;DR:"}

We have our ups and downs but we mostly get through them. This however is a weird subject for me and he won't hear my side..here goes (sorry for format, on mobile).\n\nHe was convicted of a felony in 2006/2007 for statutory. She was 17, he was 19. She openly admitted she was fine with them hooking up at the time but there was alcohol involved so that threw her consent out the window (even though they decided this sober). He went to prison and can have no contact with her until he's off parole. I never judged him for this, everyone makes mistakes and in MY opinion it's not like she was 15. He stated a few weeks ago that he wants to meet up with her when he's off parole (10-2017). He wants to tell her how she ruined his life and what this whole situation has caused him. I think it's a terrible idea, she either doesn't care or something..I really don't know. I'm at a loss of words but I think meeting up with her is stupid and could cause him more anger about the whole  situation.. \n\nI guess I'm looking for advice or a similar story or really anything at all as I am confused about the whole thing....\nTL;DR:"}

First-time poster. \nI have been thinking for so long about Life lately and how amazing and bizarre and wonderfully weird it is. I love everything about it so damn much.\nHave you ever been in one of those moods where everything just seems to flow and you know, you just KNOW that things will be fine? As if Life is this collective moving force pushing you through space and time. That everything is working out and going to be great, simply because you think it will be. There is something so incredible about it all that has a smirk always trying to inch into a smile on my face lately. I see everyday objects and events and PEOPLE oh gosh I am simply blown away and in awe at how complex they all are. \nI love people. So much so do I love people. Everyone has their own theories but i believe innately, deep down, people are good. We as a species are so incredibly complex and layered on top of foundations built seeking specific desires with different means to the goals. So some people are just lost on their own path to their goal and take it out on others. Anytime anyone is bringing down someone else on purpose, they are really satisfied with it, they are just compensating for their own personal misgivings in life. There is simply the misunderstanding of how different everything and everyone is. The subjectivity which we behold is mind-blowing. Everyone is both similar and different at the same time, and what makes us all so beautiful is what we usually end up fighting over. I've fostered a love of learning about people and what makes them all so different and how they interact, relate, and experience this wild ride. There is simply so much to take in and the amount of new information growing and needed to process is exponential. There is so much beauty in the world, so much being created, so much to love. \n\nI'm somewhat inebriated and have been thinking about all of this for some time now. So this is probably a different kind of offmychest than normal. I'll probably come back later to re-edit and organize my thoughts into something more coherent haha.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm running on 12 hours of sleep total for the past week so some stuff might not make sense.\n\nBackstory!!\nMy wife, Julie and I, are expecting our first kid in about 2 months. Our kid is planned and we both mutually agreed that we wanted kids long before we started being serious. I'm ready to start a family and I've even taken up sewing lessons from Julie's mom. That was my idea-- infant's clothes are pricey considering they're going to grow out of it in literally 2 months. I've taken a ton of parenting classes with my wife. Our baby boy is healthy as any baby can be, we have about $100k in savings and we're earning about $160k together. Julie's mom is going to take care of our kid (who runs a daycare and we both trust). We live in a pretty good school district in a friendly neighborhood. Me and Julie still love each other a lot and we almost never fight. Everything that we can do is set and ready.\n\nBut I don't think I'm ready to be a dad. I still don't think it's enough. I'm worried that I'm going to fuck up my own kid since my dad left me when I was younger and my mom was distant. When I first started dating Julie I was immature, a brat and generally an irresponsible man child. I had to learn how to take care of her when she was sick while Jules just has this instinct. She's always caring while I was emotionally stunted before I got myself into therapy.\n\nPoint being, I feel like I'm going to fuck my kid up really bad. I know I should rely on my wife and just tell her but it all seems so natural to her. She's taking this all really well, and never mentioned that she was anxious. If I do tell her, I don't want her to think that I'm leaving her and the kid or anything like that. Is it even a big deal?\nTL;DR:"}

I love everything about her and can without any doubt see my future with her. Throughout our relationship i have been struggling with some ED issues. I went to a doctor and found out that i have some hormone imbalances (too much prolactin and low but still acceptable testosterone). I still have to wait a couple weeks to see an endocrinologist about that but i still attribute some of the problem to performance anxiety since we have had a lot of success as well as the failures.\n\nAnyway, our relationship has been phenomenal except during times when we couldn't have sex. I always made attempts to please her when i lost the erections but she gets so turned off when it happens she doesn't want it. Sex is very important to her and i do feel like i am under a lot of stress to perform or lose her. While that has been an ongoing issue, now there is another that has surfaced.\n\nRecently, her ex boyfriend (went out for almost a year) has been trying to get back with her. They have always been close friends (with benefits before she and i started dating). She says he is very valuable to her as a friend, and recently she was conflicted in continuing our relationship or getting back with him. Ultimately she decided to continue our relationship and told him it won't happen. However, she still talks to him often and he continually asks her to hang out with him.\n\nI do feel particularly vulnerable right now since things are so hot/cold in the bedroom. She is very attractive and i know that many guys will be after her during our relationship which is fine since i trust her and know how much she cares about me. I do trust her with the ex as well but i know that he is going to be giving it his all to convince her to get back with him and it is very uncomfortable for me. I think i just need to be a man about it and show her why she made the right decision in choosing me, but it sucks to feel like i am still competing and it puts even more pressure on me in the bedroom.\nTL;DR:"}

She is a lets get it done/present-tense/stay focused-type.\n\nNormally that would seem like a good combination. But the problem is that she tends to get a bit condescending when our perspectives clash.

I hope you're all having a great day. \nI'll try and keep this as simple as possible. Been with my S/O for just short of 18 months. She is my world, since we got serious I have always saw us being together through life and I can't really imagine how I would live properly without her around.\nWe would usually spend a few days a week together, we don't live together but we would stay over at each others houses and it was all great. Recently she started working very long hours, 10-12 hours a day and 5 days a week. Obviously this is difficult, that's understandable. However, the problem I'm having is it leaves very little time for us to see eachother. I expected to have every weekend together however it's not that simple. She is very tired after work so I can't come to see her weekdays, and she is out of the house at around 6:30 am and it is inconvenient for me to be at her house all day without her. She said that she does want a social life with her work friends as she will be stuck with them for at least 2 years. We can't move in with eachother yet as we do not make enough to get by with rent and bills comfortably. Neither of us drive yet but she is close getting a license which will help. \nWhat does this all mean? Well, she's going to be going out on work nights out every few weeks, which means I won't be able to see her, then she has assignments to do over other weekends which means I may not be able to spend the day with her. It could be as little as once a day every 2 weeks.\n\nLike I said at the start, I don't want this to be over. I'm willing to make sacrifices if she is too. I just want to know if anyone has any advice on how I can make this easier for both of us? I really need help here and it is on my mind constantly and its emotionally hurting me. Any advice will help, positive or negative. \n\nSorry about the long post folks!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm getting a degree in the humanities, but I have really good problem solving skills and I've been using a computer since I was six. I'm the kind of person that has never had any \"formal\" training in computers but who is capable of figuring out most problems if an issue comes up.\n\nThat all being said, I am considering future career options.

My question to you all is this: What's the best path for me to consider if I want to do this that doesn't require me getting a 4-year degree in Computer Science? If I get the A+, Network+, and Security+ Certificates from CompTIA, will this be enough to get me an entry-level job? Or do most places REQUIRE a Bachelor's in Computer Science?

She is a rescue taken from a hoarder. She went through extensive training with the rescue organization because of resource aggression and fearfulness before I adopted her. In the four years I've had her, she's come a long way as far as becoming more social and outgoing with people. She lived with my husband's dog for two years, and then after he (the dog) died in January, we got a new dog, also a rescue, Penny. They generally get along except in one way - when I'm in the room. Lana has been getting progressively worse about growling and being aggressive towards Penny if Lana is sitting near me and Penny comes in the room. It's especially bad in the bedroom. Lana acts the same way towards my husband, too! We had changed some routines and rewarded her for staying in her bed, and it worked for a while, but she's back to growling at him and lunging at his feet from under the bed.\n\nSo, last night, Penny came into our bedroom at 2 am. Lana growled from under the bed, Penny kept on coming and before we could intercept, it was on. Lana ended up with a rip in the end of her ear and knocked two teeth out! Penny has a small puncture wound under her eye.  First thing we're going to do is go back to crating Penny at night. She doesn't pee in the house anymore, so we were trying letting her stay out, but not anymore. I guess I was just hoping someone might have some experience with this possessiveness problem who may have some insight?\nTL;DR:"}

For example, a lady friend of mine is having a problem with a very annoying and unattractive guy who keep sending her messages every day and she wants to get rid of him. The thing is that *SHE** keeps talking and chatting with him, despite the fact that she wants him to stop. I got numerus examples of girls who told me that they don't want a guy to chat them, but for the same fucking reason, they keep responding to him !! Why are they doing this? I know from experience that if I want a girl to stop chatting to me, I will tell her. If she continues, I will simply delete her from Facebook. I think that those girls fool guys and that's something I can't stand for. I got fooled twice from girls I thought I liked but then I realised that I was one of the dozens guys she was talking with, at the same time! My sugestion is that they just like the fact that many guys want them. Just give me an clear explenation for this girls.!\nTL;DR:"}

Like everything that happened before right now just isn't real?\nPOST: Hey guys,\n\nI moved to a new apartment, 3200 Km away from home on January. I was sharing that apartment with 2 housemates but they both moved out while I  was taking a 2 month vacation to go see my family.\n\nSince I came back, I've been feeling more and more alone, specially after my neighbors also went on vacation and the only interaction I have with people is when I go to my classes from 8:30am to 12:30. Other than that my life feels replete with solitude.\n\n9 months ago I was going out with my best friends, getting drunk and partying at least twice a week. Today, I live in a kinda big but spread out city and I barely know anyone my age. It was a really rough change. I stopped doing many of the things I was used to overnight. Everything was so drastic that I don't feel like anything like that ever happened, and that's what I'm trying to express here. I feel like my past is just made up. Nothing ever really happened when I was 10. Nothing really happened when I was 14, 15, 16 and 17. Nothing happened 9 months ago. The event I went to this Saturday never really existed. Yesterday is something I made up.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy. Every time a memory about anything comes to my mind I feel like I'm just making it up. Like if it were one of those movies where the main character has made up a fake life and then suddenly becomes lucid and notices how what he thought was real is actually fake. But then again I know it's not fake because I'm frequently contacting some of those friends I used to hang out with and most of my family. There are pictures and videos. I have scars from when I hit that tree while riding my bike 4 months ago. Everything has evidence of being real, but it just doesn't feel like it.\n\nAnyways, I really hope that when my new housemates come back I'll be able to think normally again and accept the past as something that did really exist and not something I just made up. I feel like this is one of those \"it's your brain just blocking what you dont want to remember\" things.\nTL;DR:"}

She's been really great, supportive, kind, overall she's almost the perfect girlfriend. However, I feel like I'm stuck in this relationship and I feel like I'm not enjoying life: everything is already laid out (finish college, get a job, get X kids, Y pets, go live at Z).\n\nThis used to not bother me too much but now it really does, and I'm becoming unhappy. I'm also not satisfied sexually.\n\nI like this other girl, too, and she likes me back. I've been loyal to my girlfriend however, and I do not plan to change this. But I feel like I should maybe have more than 1 relationship, just to know if I would be happier with someone else.\n\nAnyway, seeing as I'm unhappy I think it's best to end my relationship with my girlfriend, as she's also suffering under my mental state. But she has a history of self-harm and I'm really worried she'd hurt herself, because I am pretty sure that she thinks I'm the one. She'd do anything for me and she always has a huge smile when we meet. To make matters worse, the girl I fancy is her best friend, and it would be a total dick move to start something with my girlfriend's best friend, right?\n\nIt probably sounds like I'm an idiot: my girlfriend loves me more than anything in the world. I really appreciate that. But I'm really unhappy and part of it is the relationship. I think I'd rather be friends. So, should I end it and how do I make sure she's ok?\nTL;DR:"}

But she said that she wasn't ready for a relationship (she just recently broke up with a physically abusive boyfriend), so I just decided to act like nothing happened, and stay her friend until she decided she was ready. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, I would see her flirt with other guys right in front of me, so after a while, I talked to her about it. Apparently she was so drunk when we said we were attracted to each other that she had no memory of it ever happening. I asked her if it was still true, though, that she was attracted to me. She said that she only said what she did because she was drunk. However, she was just as drunk when she told me this. So naturally she has no recollection of this conversation happening either. And the things she said to me when she was telling me that she did like me were things that did not seem like spur-of-the-moment comments, but more like things she had been thinking for a while. \n\nOh and another note: The time we admitted having an attraction to each other was not the first time we had gotten \"flirty\" with each other while drunk.\nTL;DR:"}

I was emotional after a few months of this and probably caused her to break things off with her BF. We've had rocky times \u2013 we were together for a bit and I found out she was sexting with a former flame. We broke up then and got back together.

I've known our whole relationship that things ended abruptly and without closure for them. Is this as bad as normal cheating?\n\nAlso, we are currently abroad and she has all the information for our travel. I already had a mini blow up when I first confronted her this morning. I wish I had acted more cool because now I have to see her at least once more to get the airplane tickets. BTW: All of \"abroad\" refers to the same country.

There are slight discrepancies in the times he tells me...like one day he said that he goes to work 9:30am, and it turns out that he was actually going to work at 11:30am. When I ask him why he said a different time, he says \"he forgot\" or \"it gets mixed up in his head\".\n\nI don't believe that. This has happened more than once, and he's even lied to me about his days off. Yesterday, he said that he was working tomorrow when I asked him, and then all of a sudden he has the day off today??

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Tired of getting jerked around by my auto loan holder\nPOST: Last year I bought a new car (my first). At the time I didn't have credit (but knew my credit cards would start reporting a month after purchase). The only bank that would finance me was a local credit union, called Fairwinds located in Orlando, FL. I thought that was fine, because PF always recommends local credit unions for the most competitive rates. Anyways, I was approved at 14.5% and a month later I refinanced to 4.5%, where I am now. My credit scored is now 728 so I'm pretty sure I can do better. This summer I relocated to Dallas, TX and switched insurance companies because Texas has higher state minimums and my provider at the time didn't offer competitive rates here. I used an insurance agent, and they informed me that the bank had been notified of the change.\n\nLo and behold, three months later without any prior notice, I get a letter from my bank stating there was a lapse in my insurance and they have added $3k to my loan for a year of coverage from a provider of their choice. I called them immediately and they claim to have sent three letters prior. I believed them at the time, even though I was very diligent in updating the address on my account in a timely manner. So I get my insurance agent to fax over the information proving I was covered the whole time, and they say I'll be notified within two weeks of the fee being removed from my loan. So here I am now, two weeks later and I receive another letter saying there was still a lapse in coverage. It looks like they're trying to charge me for the months between when they believe I cancelled my coverage and the time it took me to get a letter from them saying they had added on insurance. I call them and they insist there was a lapse. I asked them to please double check the paperwork that was faxed over...and they found I was correct. This has been a decent waste of my time by now, and I'm pretty frustrated.\nTL;DR:"}

However, one of her friends recently posted a picture of a \"fake proposal\" on Facebook. The title says \"so happy for you on the engagement\" but a later picture surfaced saying it was just for a \"project.\" I am very confused by this whole thing for several reasons.\n \nFirst off, after a quick Facebook search I realized that the guy who was doing this fake proposal was someone who she had been texting regularly towards the end of our relationship. She said that he was just a high school friend, but on Facebook it shows that he lives at least a hundred miles away and that he never went to her high school.  \n\nAlso, I can't think of a reason why you would need to stage a fake proposal for a project and then post that pic on FB. \n\nIn addition, if this proposal is real, she would have good reason to hide it. Her parents wouldn't want her to get married this soon. \n\nLastly, it's entirely possible that posting this picture on FB is just a tactic to make me jealous.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I(20F) suck at keeping and maintaining friendships.\nPOST: For as long as I can remember, I've never had close friendships with anyone. I've never had that tight knit group or that one girl friend whom I went to the mall with or talked on the phone all day with. I had what I considered to be two semi-close friends during middle school/high school- but even those friendships were contained to school-only. I struggle with Social Anxiety and have since the beginning of middle school. If someone wanted me to hang out, I always gave an excuse not to. Partially because I didn't want to and mostly because I was too scared to leave the house if I didn't actually have to, i.e going to school.\n\nI really want some friends. I'm envious of those close knit groups that skype or play games together. I would LOVE that. I tried joining an online penfriend site awhile back- you basically would email people back and forth. I enjoyed it for quite some time but after awhile I felt overwhelmed- and I don't really recall why and I ended up just stopping all contact. Afterwards, I felt instantly relieved. I still get that overwhelmed feeling when I think about having a friend which leads me to not actively seek anyone to talk to.\n\nI got into a relationship about two years ago and we're engaged now. I feel close to my fiance(20M) but it leaves me wondering why am I able to hold down a romantic relationship but I just fail at normal friendships? I don't understand it at all.\nTL;DR:"}

Within the past 1-2 weeks she has regularly come into my room (I have a single) so we can work on homework together and sometimes just to hang out.\n\nShe always seems excited to see me and we talk about a lot of stuff, and I think she may like me back but I can't tell because she has a lot of male friends (from the sports team) who she spends time with (sometimes alone) and compliments. I don't accuse her of playing games, but I can't read when she is just being nice or a friend or when she's interested.\n\nI want to tell her how I feel, but I have almost no experience in this and every time I've tried to do this to another girl things wound up becoming awkward. I'd rather have this girl as a friend then make things awkward, especially since we're both in this sport and I know I'll be working with her closely and can't afford for things to get awkward between us if she doesn't share my feelings. I know if we did actually go out I'd be able to put it aside while we work, but I don't know how she and our relationship would react in this situation.\n\nI guess I also have a tendency to overthink things, so these may not be real issues. Should I tell her how I feel and if so, how can I best do it?\nTL;DR:"}

We broke up in March because his friend bought a house and he realized where he was at in life, and blamed me. We've been apart for 4 months, and since then I got my first apartment and started learning how to take care of myself.\n\nLast night he messaged me on Facebook. We started talking about my dental appointments, his family and mine and at one point he said he missed me and wanted to see me. I told him my address and if he wanted he could come over because I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss him too.\n\n10 minutes after he got there he asked, \"Do you want to be with me?\" I nodded my head yes. We had sex, and I went back to his moms place (that's where he lives) and spent the night. We said \"I love you\" and \"I missed you\" and now I'm hanging with his mom while he's at work.\n\nIt was only 4 months ago that we broke up, but it feels more like years. I feel disconnected and I don't know how I feel about this at all. I guess what I'm trying to get at is does any of this sound like a good idea?\n\nThe only plan I could think of is to keep our living arrangements separate. I stay in my apartment and he stays at his moms, our financials stay separate, and if we ever move in again it's in our own place, never again will we live together at his parents.\n\nThat way our \"dynamics\" are more equal. I'm still very confused about how I feel about all of this, it seems/feels strange and everything I thought would never happen again is happening and I'm feeling pretty strange..\nTL;DR:"}

Long story (somewhat) short, I was finally named executor of the estate a month or so ago after my mom couldn't handle it, and I'm sorting through all the outstanding medical bills that were left unpaid.  One thing I immediately noticed is that several of these bills have significant late fees after going unpaid for a year and a half.  The primary concern, for example, is a $170 bill that is now $940.\n\nSo here's my main question: What are the chances that I could call up the creditors, explain the situation, and just pay the original amount of the bill?  I plan to attempt this regardless of what anybody here says, but I guess I'm just wondering what I should expect.\n\nAnother (less important) question: We pretty much stopped receiving bills around the middle of last year.  A few of bills went to collections, and those were almost all handled already.  But the rest just don't try anymore.  If they're not still asking for money, should I pay them anyway?  By this point, I'd imagine they've already written the unpaid bills off as a loss.  We're almost two months into a six month period during which creditors can file a claim against the estate for outstanding bills, and we haven't been contacted by anybody yet.\n\nAlso, if anybody has any questions for their own interest about this whole situation (the stroke, the medical care, the bills, the estate process, etc), ask and I'll answer what I can.\nTL;DR:"}

When my SO of 5 years and I broke up, I cut him off for what has to be the third time in my life as he refused to stop hanging out with her.

A while back he managed to knock up the girl he's been sleeping with - not his girlfriend, mind you, just his 'squeeze.' Within the next few weeks it there were serious questions raised about whether \"Meg\" had tried to get pregnant or not - main factors being that 1) She had been pregnant and miscarried before 2) It was their 'first time without a condom' and all he had was her word that she was on birth control 3) She later changed her mind about adoption and opted to keep the baby, which she wanted to have his last name even though they were never together\n\nSo months in to the pregnancy, I'm pretty convinced she tried to trap my brother into this because she wanted a kid (and my brother is not the type of man to walk away from child.) My family is supportive and preparing to bring in their grandchild, and my brother is trying his hardest to make this thing work. So we get the phone call tonight that the baby is dead and I can't help but feel that this is the best thing that could have happened to him. He's angry and hurt, and I can't imagine what he's going through - but all I see is the 18 years of child support he's not paying and the custody battle he doesn't have to fight.

Another example is choosing what I want to do in school. I am a biochemistry major and am thinking of minoring in computer science. He says it's a waste of time and money to minor in something like that when there is somebody more skilled with a major in it. He says it won't help me at all and that I shouldn't even consider it. I was excited thinking about doing it because I am sort of interested in it and I remember programming when I was 12. I just want to try it out and see for myself if I like it or not.

If this is the wrong place for this, please let me know!]\n\nI am 25(F) and have never felt like I know how to be in a professional setting. Its a little strange because I have always worked a variety of jobs (retail, law office, and currently in a different office environment) but I've always felt that I was \"winging\" it. The older I get, the more uncomfortable I feel at work including at my current job. I feel that I don't come across as particularly confident or capable. I struggle with anxiety and depression, which doesn't help. No one in my life ever really took me under their wing to show me how to present myself. (My mom is not feminine at all, so makeup and hair/skin care are also things I'm interested in but have no clue where to start and I feel very behind).\n\nSome other things that might not be helping: -I'm on a budget, I'm 4'10\" and told I have a baby face, and I'm overweight. (Slowly coming to terms with the fact that I may have binge eating disorder because my eating patterns are not normal).\n\nI feel like I know what I want to do, but I don't know where to start, and I don't have many people in my life to turn to.

My Mom [50sF] will be crushed when he leaves. What steps can I take to prepare her/ us?\nPOST: We've been looking after a baby [10 months old] for 6 months now. He was physically abused by his parents and placed into emergency care with us.\n\nWe've had him through Christmas and birthdays, and all of us have become increasingly attached to this little bundle of joy. My Mother especially, probably due to the fact that she is the primary care giver.\n\nWe've fostered many children in the past but none this young or with futures so uncertain. Chances are when all the court proceedings are finished, we'll never see him again. There's a small chance of contact if he gets adopted, but there's also a large possibility he'll go back to his family.\n\nWe've all spoken briefly about how badly we'll all feel the loss when the baby finally gets re-homed, but I was wondering if there are any measures we can take in order to soften the blow slightly. The feeling of being unprepared for an inevitable loss is really taking it's toll on me. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

I didn't really think about the effects of drinking too much soda until the show was over.\n\nThe fuck up: Before we left I kinda needed to use the bathroom, but I didn't think it would take too long to get from there to home and I'm not too fond of using public restrooms with my mom. Little did I realize later that night, I would make a huge mistake. My parents and I went to our car and started to drive off, but we had to sit in traffic for at least 30 minutes before we could finally get on the road. We kept going for about 30 minutes more before we stopped at McDonald's to get something to eat. At this point, I needed to go badly, but me being the somewhat cocky teen I was thought I could make it and accidents only happen to little kids. Well, I ate my food and drank more soda and I sat in my seat somewhat uncomfortably as we drove 15 more minutes to get home. When we got there, I ran out the door and ran inside the house. As I sat down on the stairs to take my shoes off, I get a warm feeling down there. It only took me a second or two to realize I was peeing, so since the stairs were made out of carpet and I could not stop mid stream, I went to the tile floor and finished my business. Well, after that, even 2 1/2 years later, my parents won't stop embarrassing me about it and comparing me to my dog who pees on the floor 80% of the time.\nTL;DR:"}

It's getting frustrating.\nPOST: Me and my boyfriend have been going out for about 2 years. Lately we've both been stressed out a lot from school/college apps/fights with family and with our sports seasons starting we don't get to spend a whole bunch of time together.\n\nLately we've been fighting a lot about the same issues. I feel like he doesn't open up to me enough and like we don't have enough serious conversations and all we do is joke around. He thinks that I just want to have serious conversations to have them, not becuase there is stuff I actually want to talk about. He also is pretty private and there are some things that I'd want to talk about but he just doesn't ever want to talk about.\n\nWhenever we talk about this (which is maybe once a week) or other things (like how he never texts me back) he usually apologizes and says he will work on it. He then doesn't work on it & everything is the same again. I tell him this makes me upset, he says that he only apologizes to make me happy and end the conversation.\n\nI tell him that he's not ending it he's only making me more upset, because i get my hopes up and then nothing happens. He says that I should be the one to step up and apologize because he always has too. I don't want to do that with issues that are important to me, because it bothers me so much that he does it.\n\nAnd It's not like I don't apologize or admit I'm wrong about things, if it's a silly little fight or I've inadvertently done something that makes him upset I'll be the first to apologize. \n\nIt's making me really upset because I feel like he isn't listening to what I am saying and his apology doesn't mean anything anymore, and that really sucks. I know we aren't always the best communicators, but I'm willing to work on it and I'm sure he is too. I don't know what to do and could use some outside imput.\nTL;DR:"}

She is/was in the waiting line to be spayed by the local humane society as they do cheap spays and shots for those who meet certain criteria, because I am a college student I can take advantage of this program but the only draw back is a month or more waiting period, and so I've been waiting for her number to be called but it hasn't yet. This is her second time going into heat.\n\nThe issue at hand, my cat is not an outdoor cat but we do let her on our roof, it can be accessed from the windows and there is no way down or up, or so we thought, and that is the only reason she has any outdoor time. Well yesterday morning I woke up to my cat coming back through my window and going out my bedroom door, when I looked up there was a second cat standing at the foot of my bed, a neighborhood stray I hadn't seen before. I was startled and the cat took off out my window and down a tree that is on the side of my house, that I didn't think was close enough to use as a way up or down. I checked my cat for bites and she was missing some fur on the side of her neck, but no open wounds, and has been walking around with her tail down and grooming her genital area a lot more than usual. \n\nMy questions would be how soon can I tell if she is pregnant and what to do if she is as far as any necessary food changes, vitamins, space for birthing, etc. I've had cats all my life but usually males and only dealt with new born kittens once a long time ago when I was 4-5.\nTL;DR:"}

Though, I guess it's because I mainly just tried to repress what happened (and why I thought the problem lie elsewhere).

I hate feeling this way. \n\nHow can I work through these feelings? How can I communicate better with my partner to overcome this?\nTL;DR:"}

That wasn't Tod's idea. His roommate approved her staying at their place, after all they were friends. I wasn't very happy at all and got upset when he told me.

Also he suggested her to hang out at his apartment and I wasn't happy about that either. I have work this weekend so I can't be there. If I don't have any plans, I won't be there anyway cuz I don't feel comfortable to be around her. I asked him if he wanted to hang out with her. He said yes and it made me upset even more.

We all left uni 3 years ago, but still meet up a few times a year. Jimmy and Alicia are somewhat cool with each other, they're still pretty friendly, although won't choose to each see each other outside of the friendship group.\n\nHowever, Jimmy has a new girlfriend, Lana [23F], (they've now been together for over a year) who's intimidated by Alicia and doesn't want to be around when Alicia's there. It's a shame because Alicia's one of my long time friends, and Lana's also a super cool girl who I'd like to get to know better. Basically, they're both awesome people, and they have got on well in the past. However, Lana's still not comfortable when Alicia's around. Lana gets pretty anxious over social things, and Jimmy and Alicia's relationship was a pretty big deal in our friendship group, were planning moving in together, marriage, etc which I guess makes it even more intimidating for Lana. Also, the rest of the friendship group isn't entirely helpful for putting her at ease when Alicia's visiting, saying things like \"Oh my god isn't it going to be SUPER WEIRD seeing Alicia??\" etcetc.\n\nI'd really love for us to all be able to meet up easily, and for Lana to be at ease if Alicia's going to be around- I'm basically looking for some suggestions from y'all to help Lana feel more comfortable with the whole situation.\nTL;DR:"}

Last night I told her I wanted a true break with absolutely no talking for at least a few days and she came back again this morning telling me that she couldn't do it. I haven't responded yet because I don't know what to say.\n\nFurther background: I'm 4 hours away as a sophomore college and she's at home working and taking some classes, so I see her ~4 months out of the year,  usually every 3-4 weeks (except for break). There's nothing \"wrong\" in our relationship, I just feel like it's been stagnant for the past year and although it's enjoyable, I have always preferred to hang out with other friends than her, pretty much invariably. I've never experienced being single really, and I'm nearly halfway done with college and have lately been feeling bored with this relationship, so I wonder if it's time to try something new.\n\nIt's all complicated by the fact that for the past several weeks I've had an interest in another girl here at college, but I've been trying to not let that affect my decision about this for obvious reasons. I just don't know if it's just a petty crush or if it's an indication that I really should re-think my long-distance relationship. If I weren't in a relationship, I would definitely pursue this other girl, which has had me very frustrated/confused lately.\n\nI know you can't answer this for me, but I really would appreciate any tips on how I should go about this decision. I go home for break next weekend and it's sort of expected that I'll decide by then, and I'm worried I'll regret whichever decision I make. Thank you so much for any help you give.\nTL;DR:"}

I was just causally talking with my boss about university and part time work and the like, and was explaining about a new job I was starting in the coming weeks. I can't remember exactly what it was I said, but a comment of mine sent him into hysterics. When he'd finished laughing, he took a swig from his can of IRN-BRU (Scottish beverage, for those that aren't familiar) and was hit once again by a fit of giggles. He proceeded to choke on his drink, coughed, and ended up spitting it up into the face of one of the other managers. She stumbled backwards laughing and ended up bumping into Sean, who was knocked flailing backwards into the stack of Cardboard pizza boxes. (When stacked in bulk they can be pretty heavy) This led to the full stack coming tumbling down onto Stephanie, whom was carrying a large tub of barbecue sauce. She dropped the tub, which burst and cascaded all over the floor. It all happened so quickly that Megan (who was just passing though the kitchen) didn't have any time to react, and slipped on the spilt sauce. On her way down she made an effort to save herself and made a grab for the metal table, but In turn grabbed a box (with pizza inside) and pulled it down on top of her own face, covering herself in jalape\u00f1os and ketchup. Everyone was silent throughout the shop, before erupting into a chorus of laughter. \n\nWhile this wasn't entirely/technically my fault, I am still blamed for the incident. \nYou could say it was, a domino effect.\nTL;DR:"}

But, some of the things he said do make sense, which is why I'm even considering it.  We've only been dating a few months now, and my lease on my place is up end of July.  \n\nAt first I thought he was joking, but he seriously suggested that I move in with him instead of renewing to save money for a down payment on a place.  My plan is to buy within a year, and I can't deny that living with him would allow me to save a ton to put down even more.  I just can't get around the fact we've only just started dating.  \n\nI make very good money, so it's not that I need to live with him.  I could easily afford renewing my lease on my current apartment and still continue saving like I have.  But, my apartment and utilities are expensive, so living together would save me at least $1400/month based on the deal he has on his place and sharing costs.  \n\nAnd, if things didn't work out then it's not like I couldn't find a place or afford to move out on my own.  \n\nSo, how crazy is it to even be considering this option this early?

However, I have recently been having doubts about it, and have decided that it is time to move on, so I plan on breaking up with her some time soon. But I'm not here to discuss the reasons why I am doing this, because it is something that I have been thinking about for a while and have already made the decision to do.\n\nMy concern, and the main reason I haven't gone through with this earlier, is about the emotional  damages that I will undoubtedly cause by doing this. This is probably a stupid question, because everyone who has ever had to break up with someone has had to deal with this to some extent, but how can I justify causing so much harm to someone I care so much about? She always talks about how I am the most important thing in her life and how she doesn't know what she would do without me, and I  worried that this is literally true; she relies on me for so much emotional support that taking that away from her would just be devastating. She will probably be depressed for a long period of time, her grades will likely suffer as will her social life, and she will most likely experience issues with trust, self confidence, and relationships in the future. Knowing that I will be solely responsible for so negatively affecting her life makes it seem like it is almost better to stay unhappy in a relationship than end it at the cost of incurring lasting damages on the course of my girlfriend's life. \n\nTaking this subject to an extreme, what if your partner hypothetically told you they would kill themselves if you broke up with them? How would you react to that, and would you have a responsibility to stay in the relationship to save her life?\n\nIf anyone has any perspectives or advice about this topic that they are willing to share, I would greatly appreciate it as this is pretty much all I can think about right now.

I still have no idea how they got there and I guess that means he sat his bare butthole on my screen which makes me cringe and want to cry. \n\nI proceeded to scream like a banshee at 2am and literally soaked my screen in rounds of bleach. I also looked down at my dog who had followed me and he had somehow managed to get a worm on his back. At this point I'm on the verge of hysterics and my poor dog thinks I'm super pissed at him but in reality I just fucking HATE parasites like any normal human.\n\nI fucking thought those rice grains were nothing, turns out they were fucking tapeworms. I stayed up until 4am last night purging the house, locking the dog outside (who wouldn't stop howling till 5am) and genuinely on the verge of puking since it happened. \n\nMy poor dogs butt hole was literally crawling with them. So now not only did he probably infest my parents house, but also my apartment where my poor roommates live who are as you guessed it, rather unpleased. Guess who has doctors appointments and a vet appointment ASAP?\nTL;DR:"}

I [20 F] live 4h away.\nPOST: Our relationship is a bit complicated because we met on a dating website in march, talked a lot on fb but didn't meet till summer, about 3 weeks before I moved to study in a different city. So we went on 5 dates or so (made out) and then I moved 4h away (by car). We didn't really talk about what was going on between us but it felt right. So I when I went back to my hometown to visit family we had sex for the first time and we talked that we're exclusive. But he didn't tell anybody, not his friends nor family.\nNow the problem is that I am ready to meet his parents and that he meets mine but he is not. (His friends kinda know now, met them while partying) We're planning to go on vacation, so this weekend I'll be in my hometown and I said that I could go to his house or he could come to mine. And we could look for destinations and stuff on the PC. But he insists that we can look everything up together on our phones -_- I told him that that's so dumb and if I'll ever meet his parents. And he just said, well then come over... But I don't want to if he doesn't sincerely want it as well. I've been at his once when his parents weren't home. Is he embarassed of me? or what do you think could be the problem? What should I do? I'm also thinking about asking if he's ok if I change my fb-status to: in a relationship.

She seems constantly stressed and anxious about really anything school related. I've tried helping her, but nothing I try seems to work. How should I respond?\n\nIn school Amy always seems stressed about failing tests, assignments, etc., and she has confessed she is often nervous when she takes tests, even though she is very smart and quite consistently gets good grades in her classes, and should have no reasons to worry about this. Before tests, she often talks about how she thinks she's going to fail them, and while it's normal for students at my school to say this once in a while, this happens before every test/assignment.  \n\nShe also says she never has free time, despite the fact that we are mostly in the same classes. Although some of them are difficult, I almost never feel like I have too much homework to do. Amy also says that she goes to bed at midnight, or even later, regularly because she has so much to do. \n\nIn addition to this when she texts me, and when we talk in person, she rants, spouting off how she is stressed, tired, etc., or even how she has low self-esteem and she has fear of failing. This is sadly a very major topic she brings up and I don't know how to help her with this. I try to tell her that her fears are unfounded, but this doesn't seem to work.\n\nSometimes when I text Amy she also changes the subject I am trying to talk about. I texted her today about something funny someone said, and instead she directly responded with a message about how stressed and tired she is, and about how much work she always has, entirely unrelated to what I originally texted her about.  \n\nLike I said, I try to be understanding and help her calm down but she always seems to have some level of anxiety and self-doubt in much of her schoolwork, even though she is very smart. I'm not sure what else I could do to help.\nTL;DR:"}

I thought I should start off by saying that. He has this one friend [24/f] who has had a crush on him since before I even met him. At first I didn't pay any attention to her, but then it caught my attention that she flirted with him a lot, and he didn't really do much about it. I don't know if he really flirts back with her, but I get a feeling that he has feelings for her or something (he definitely did before we started dating). I know he would never cheat on me, ever. But every time I see he's been paying any attention to her, even just a tiny facebook comment, I feel like dying inside. He rarely ever does this, I must add. He knows this whole thing bothers me, and he thinks it's funny. He tries bugging me about her sometimes, and as much as it hurts me he still thinks it's stupid for me to worry about her and gets some sort of amusement from my jealousy. I really can't stand the thought of him having any sort of feelings for this girl, and I know if he wanted to be with her he would have tried to by now (I repeat, he has not cheated on me and he never would) but I just can't handle this raging jealousy in my stomach every time she even pops up on my newsfeed.

For the story let's call him Alex. Alex messaged me asking if I recall an event that I had long since forgotten, and now the past has come back to haunt me.\n\nAs i mentioned, the two of us, along side another friend, who shall be called Jared, constantly hung out ranging from swimming or just heading out to the park for a game of football. Anyway, this one day, we decided to go to a small park filled with random bushes everywhere (you'll see why i mention this) that was about a mile away from my house, and we figured \"Hey, what's the worst that could happen.\" So after eating a huge lunch of spicy lamb curry, I met up with Jared who said Alex would meet us there. We headed out on our bikes and halfway there i got a strange burning sensation that passed though me. it lasted for a minute or two then it went away. Not thinking anything of it, i decided to continue traveling and when i got there it hit me. I looked around for a public restroom and there was not one to be found. I had to go really badly and you guessed it folks, i dropped a deuce behind a bush away from my friend, so they couldn't see. Your imagination can fill in what happened after that, and when it came time to wipe, I reluctantly i had to grab a leaf and make do. This is where the real FU began. In my desperate attempt to hide from Jared, Alex had completely slipped my mind. I turn around and i see him just grinning in an devilish manner. I biked home, unable to sit properly due to the burning, and when i got home i locked myself in the bathroom. The following day, a Monday, he would just laugh and say \"need a leaf\". Since that dreadful day i fear my secret being told and people knowing it was me (hence the throwaway).\nTL;DR:"}

Although there are few, I tend to be very up front and sometimes too forward with how I approach her. I understand that it is sometimes difficult for her to listen to my complaints without getting upset. It is not my intent to hurt her feelings; rather, I try to eliminate problems while they are still small in hopes they will not become a larger problem. She often becomes upset even when I try to approach the situation as delicately as possible. She admits she has trouble listening to criticism and accepting her faults, and I admit I am sometimes too candid when speaking about issues I have with her. \n\nShe, on the other hand, has a great deal of trouble expressing her issues with me while they still only bother her to a minor extent. She does not tell me about things that bother her and they eventually show themselves in unpleasant ways. Sometimes it is when we have alcohol to drink, and sometimes it is when she is an unhappy mood and I have said something which would be considered the tipping point. I have very thick skin and have told her on many occasions that she can be as blunt with me as she'd like. I recognize that I have many faults and I'm always willing to improve myself and work on becoming a better person. Even knowing this, she has a great deal of trouble opening up to me before it's too late.\n\nI love this girl very much and I hope to spend the rest of my life with her, but these issues are beginning to cripple our relationship.

It arrived and was defective with a known manufacturer's defect on the screen. \n\nWe had to put down a $190 deposit plus pay for shipping to put in a warranty claim. The phone costs $130, but the deposit is $190.\n\nReplacement arrives, and has the same manufacturer defect. It is also a refurbished phone- we called to complain, and the rep tells us that they always replace phones under warranty with used phones. They wont allow a refund/return because by this point it had been more than 30 days since the original phone was purchased. \n\nAnother $190 deposit and shipping costs for a warranty replacement of the warranty replacement phone. We finally get a working phone after 2 months and 2 deposits ($380) and are out $30ish in shipping for the replacements. And its used/\"refurbished.\" \n\nThe fact that a \"refurbished\" phone has a known factory defect is very odd. It's a problem with the adhesive behind the screen which causes a quarter-sized bubble in the screen. There's no real way to fix it and it shows up pretty much immediately. So how could Cricket think that they could just resell a visually defective phone and call it refurbished? \n\nIs this legal? Should I report them to some business bureau?

As such, she blames herself for my brother's lack of ability. \n\nThis causes friction between my parents which I only just learned about, though I'd suspected it for a while. Mom blames herself which Dad doesn't want, because - really - it's neither of their faults (even if my mother has coddled my brother as a means of protecting him from the world for which he is so ill-equipped to navigate on his own). \n\nMom gets upset when Dad gets frustrated with my brother.

I asked whether she runs any, and she informed me that she does. I am athletic but running is a new hobby of mine, so I asked if I could join her sometime.

As I'm turning the corner to enter the kitchen, I see a figure and I hear \"OH SHIT WHAT THE FUCK\", next thing I know, I'm getting kicked in the face. \nI suppose my friend recognized my foul mouth screaming back at him, because then he turned the light on and started apologizing profusely.\nTL;DR:"}

I live in a different state, so I am shopping online and would ship it out to her. I am male, and 28 years old. She owns a daycare and my dad is a psychologist. They live pretty simple and I have no idea what she likes. They just started going to the gym. They eat organic and are very health conscious. She's not really into jewelry or anything expensive (e.g., Coach purse), and does not shop at Nordstroms or anything like that. She's kind of a hippy I guess. She works a lot in the daycare that she owns. They own a house. They make good money but I have no idea what they spend it on because they don't own a lot of shit. They have bookshelves full of books, but again I am pretty sure they are all my dad's books. Man, it's really hard because I have no idea what she is into. She raised me from the time I was 7, but all I remember her being into was raising her kids. I don't want to buy them a gift certificate. They made it a point on Christmas not to get me a gift certificate and got me an iPad instead.\nTL;DR:"}

She's admitted that he would probably go back out with her in a heartbeat, but that they were meant to be just friends and nothing more (the cheating was a lack of sexual chemistry). I believe her. She says their families are close and he's kind of part of the family, but there is no way in hell she'd ever do anything with him again.\n\nShe insists that I fulfill all of her needs etc. etc. and it makes me feel great, but I still can't shake this awfully jealous feeling like I'm just WAITING for it to happen.

I'll just call her Hannah. My administrator hired Hannah as my assistant to help deal with the extra workload. We've worked together for about 3 years and I've never needed to micromanage her or treat her as a subordinate. She is very competent, energetic and hardworking, and I delegate a fair share of work to her. She knows her usual responsibilities and works autonomously with occasional guidance most of the time.\n\nShe's always had a tendency to let power/responsibility go to her head. Lately it's becoming a more of a problem than just a minor nuisance.\n\nHannah has recently been going to some management/leadership seminars, *not* at our boss' request , mind you. She has begun to seemingly enjoy rudely mouthing off at clients, who we'd prefer to keep happy, obviously. Nobody has complained yet but I worry it's only a matter of time before she offends someone and they take their business elsewhere.\n\nJust in the past couple of weeks this behavior has escalated to trying to order me around and also using obvious manipulation tactics to try and outsmart me and get her way. She has started demanding to know my exact schedule, texting me about work on my days off (with no real need) and trying to control details of my work.\n\nSome people may assume from this that she's trying to steal my job, but she isn't qualified, and would need to get a different degree. So there's no risk of me losing my job to her, but I'm sick of her trying to push me around. She just seems to want power and control over people. How can I get her to mind her own business without getting rude or confrontational? Manipulation, passive-aggressiveness... all of that is on the table here. I don't want to lose a valuable person, but I can't carry on like this.\nTL;DR:"}

My mother is disabled but receives few benefits because dad also pays her alimony. There is absolutely NO possibility of her working ever again. I live with her and help her.\n\nAnyway, so I went to see my brother this past weekend. We discussed our dad and how he is aging. He is aging very poorly and doesn't care for himself (despite the fact that his new wife is a nurse) and I live under the very real fear that he will soon have a heart attack. My brother said that if dad dies he will fight (in court) our step-mother to give mom what he can get. I believe, however, that dad has tied up the money in such a way that if he dies, mom's income stops and we have no recourse. \n\nOf course, she would receive some money in disability payments but that would take time and it would be meager. Also, she has already managed to run up some debt. I had an idea that I would start some sort of savings for her. \n\nIs a general savings account best in this situation or should I look to something else? I'm very new to the world of finance so I'm unsure of my options. \n\nHow much should I put in the account?\nTL;DR:"}

He treated me really well but I took that for granted and broke it off once because I thought I didn't feel the same about him anymore. We decided to be friends and eventually I started to fall for him again so we got back together, but then he broke up with me because he \"didn't want a relationship\" and said we couldn't be friends because we had been through too much together. \n\nThis was a little over a year ago. We've both graduated since then and I haven't seen him for several months, but I still find myself constantly thinking about him. And by that I mean he is literally on my mind 24/7. I'm always wondering where he is and what he's doing, if he moved on already or if he possibly still thinks of me. It's especially difficult late at night because that's when I'm most vulnerable; I always find myself reminiscing on memories and reading our old conversations and looking back at old pictures. I've had to resist the urge to text him begging him to get back together countless times. \n\nI feel pathetic knowing that it's been so long since we broke up and I still feel the way I felt about him when we were together. I'm almost positive that he's moved on and could very well be dating other girls at this point, but for some reason I still hold onto this shred of hope that we could get back together. It scares me knowing that I've been heartbroken this long, and that I haven't made any progress getting over him yet.

I don't know how serious. She never talks about him in class. I've only seen them together once, and if I know anything about relationships, not that much, they seemed pretty distant. He was smiling and all but she just looked normal. I never see them in the hallway or nothing.\n\nI think she might like me in some way, but it could just be my imagination.\n\nI don't want to ruin anyone's relationship here. Especially mine. I can't get over her. But I think I need too. Should I or keep trying to flirt with her?\nTL;DR:"}

My SO and I have been together 2 years. We love each other very much but we have our problems, like ever other couple. We can both get a bit possessive and jealous but we are working on it together. We've gotten considerably better than we were but we still aren't where we'd like to be. \n\nIn mid to late August we are moving in together and we are both excited about it and planning..... But I have a problem. I talk in my sleep. Like a lot. Most nights in fact, it's lead to embarrassing situations many times as I've blurted out some random shit. I'm not worried about the random shit so much as the possible sex dreams. I don't have them every night but it still happens whether I want it to or not. And they aren't always about him.... So I need some feed back. \n\nIs it normal to have dreams of others when you are in a loving committed relationship? (my guess is yes but I'm just making sure...) how would you react if your girlfriend/boyfriend/SO/whatever you call yourselves came to you with this? How should I go about bringing this up without potentially upsetting him? (I don't think he would freak out or anything just maybe be a bit grumpy about the possibility.) and last but not least does anyone have any idea how to stop their selves from sleep talking? I really hate it, I've said some weird stuff.\nTL;DR:"}

Its a 5 week long ordeal that has been stressing her out. Well she's stopped talking to me. Some info, we've been dating since May. I've met her parents. I have told her I love her. So anyways. Last Friday we texted a little bit but she was on a break with her family. So I figured I'd leave her alone. Monday I texted her a picture I saw here on reddit and hoped her day went well. Didn't get a response. \n\nYesterday I texted her a picture of a box of power bars she got me, thanking her and telling her she is sweet. No response from that either. So at around 8:45 last night I called her. She didn't answer. I left a message saying I that I hope everything is going ok. We haven't talked in a while. I figure she's busy and stressed with work so I just wanted to see how its going. I hoped she'd call back or text something simple like a hi. I also invited her to a roast of one of my best friends. And hoped I hear back from her.\n\nWoke up this morning and saw she texted me at 11:41pm. She said she was out, just got my message. She said she hadn't heard from me so she made other plans for this weekend so she wont be going to the roast.  She was going to bed now. We can talk tomorrow. \n\nThis seems odd, but I admit I can be a worry wart too. The only thing I can think of is her friends from Canada are in town. She can drop off the map when they come to town and they go out during the week and stay out sort of late. I hope that's the case. At least then it makes a lot more sense. \n\nI texted her back this morning. I mentioned that we should do something tonight. I'm guessing when we do talk I should keep cool and not show that this bothered me a ton. Any advice from anyone who has dealt with this? I think at this point I just want to talk with somebody, anybody about it.\nTL;DR:"}

Or basically white girls (European, australian, etc). I like other girls too but haven't really had this issue until I started talking to my parents about dating a white girl. They are kinda afraid that they will not understand our culture. Especially our food. Most Asian eat everything and sometimes they eat some crazy things to most people.\n\nThey tell me that if I do get a white girl she better be able to handle peppers, seafood, and even be willing to try our food period or shes out. I didn't think much about it at first but after asking some of them what they like to eat (My close friends). They mostly respond with chicken..or American or Italian. If they do say Asian they mean like Hibachi or the Chinese buffet. Which really isn't close to the rel deal home made food.\n\nSo I don't wanna scared her away with our crazy culture and food. I also don't want my parents to hate her either. I mean I've dated other races and I'm sure there are white girls that like various foods but man this seems hard.

I was homeschooled up until 9th grade, so I have bad social skills and possible AvPD, though I haven't been diagnosed. During the time I was homeschooled I literally did not have a single friend. I was around my parents 24/7/365. Since there was nothing else around me, I took a great interest in computers, video games and technology in general, since I've also always been a very analytical person.\n\nAnyway, for the most part I couldn't care less how I look, I rarely buy new clothes, shoes, etc. I don't have a girlfriend, don't care if I'm attractive or not, I don't have a car, I'm not athletic, I'm overweight, I really don't care in the slightest bit about sports or sports teams, etc. Most people are miles ahead of me in these areas; fit, well-dressed and groomed, drive nice cars, etc.\n\nBut when you start talking around me about what kind of computer you have, what phone you have, etc. you'd better stand the hell back. If someone has a better phone than me, I will do everything in my power to get one with a bigger screen, faster processor, newer version of Android, etc. If someone says they have a laptop or a Mac, I laugh in their face for buying inferior technology. I have invested hundreds if not thousands of dollars in my computer, overclocking EVERYTHING to get the highest possible benchmarks, etc. not because I need the performance, but solely because I want to be able to say I have the fastest computer. If I had the money, I would buy 16-24GB of RAM just to increase the size of my e-peen and impress the people I know with large numbers.\n\nSadly, I live in Texas. The redneck part of Texas. Nobody, and I mean literally not one single person, is interested in computers. 500 people in my school, and I am the only \"computer geek\", which means all this boasting about my impressive, expensive hardware goes unnoticed.\nTL;DR:"}

I told her the movie is about BDSM, and that it is a bad representation of what is good/safe BDSM, and not about... vanilla sex. She understood my point, but said she still wanted to go and believes the \"shock\" could help change her mind regarding this things. \n\nAfter that discussion she told me to recommend her other movies that I would consider good (to watch with her childhood friend).

Our friendship began because she lived in the dorm across the hall from me and her roommate was nuts, so I let her sleep on my floor until the housing office assigned her another room. During this time we became very close, due to our similar histories and interests.\n\nAlso during this time, I was struggling with a lot of relationship drama and juggling multiple partners (not cheating, just dating multiple people). She was experiencing the same thing, however told each of her partners (she was cheating) about my problems therefore leading them to believe I was a bad influence or made bad decisions, when her decisions behind their backs were much worse. This made me angry and I wanted to expose her cheating.\n\nAt the end of summer, we went back to our home states and schools, but kept in touch and went on a long road trip to Canada together during Christmas. However, I realize now that since the end of summer we haven't talked at all since we've been apart except for when she has some problem (besides planning the trip). We're fine when we are together, but she only initiates or maintains conversation about her problems when we are apart.\n\nWe are going back to the place we met to work this summer and I'm not sure if I can be her friend without letting her know how I feel about how she ignores me when we're apart.

In the photo she was wearing leggings and her back was to the camera. So, her ass was in full view. \nI thought that was kinda creepy of him to save a picture like that, but I didn't think it was a big deal at the time so I didn't say anything.\n\nThis morning he left for work and I was left alone in his room. I know the password to his laptop and was feeling a little curious, I wanted to know if he had any other photos like the one I saw last night.\n\nI ended up finding a lot of the regular porn photos, nothing I wouldn't expect... Until I started scrolling down and uncovered the gold mine of Facebook ass shots. Sooo many girls I know/went to school with, all in bikinis, tight jeans or yoga pants.

Unfortunately, after a few weeks of working there, I noticed that one of my co-workers (Let's call him C [34M] here) was entirely my type -- sociable, smart, kind of cocky. I was shocked that I could still has a crush on anyone because I thought I was way over that, but apparently not.\n\nI have always been shy -- I tended to avoid the guy I like when I was in middle school, and even though I am now much more outgoing as an adult (I'm on friendly terms with most people at my office), I had still been unintentionally avoiding C. The only topic that I am comfortable with him is gaming, so when he started a video game conversation with me, I can usually respond less-awkwardly. The fact that we can now have something among the line of a friendship is, honestly, quite miraculous to me.\n\nHere is my dilemma: I can't/don't want to act on my feelings because I know it's wrong and it's against my values. But the fact that I do nothing is also making me painful because he'll never reciprocate my feelings since I do absolutely nothing (even though he still might NOT reciprocate if I act on it, which is all the more reason for me NOT to). Even if I want to act on it, I probably can't because I'm simply can't or am too scared to do so. \n\nShould I just leave me job? it's a pity that I'm leaving a job for a sole person, especially I like the people here, and I feel motivated to get things done.\nTL;DR:"}

However it's time I told the world my story, and what better a way to do so then (for the most part) anonymously on the internet. Anyway, so during my routine game of tag at recess with my friends I noticed a familiar feeling in my... loins. After a couple minutes of doing the \"peepee dance\", I realized it was time to act.\n\nI rushed from the playground until I reached the door into the school. Now, the door into the school was within a gate that was always open during recess, but closed at most other times. Despite this however, the doors into the school were also locked 24-7 (weird hyper security I guess). So I passed through the gate and began banging on the door to the school to get some one to open it from the inside.\n\nAfter a good 5 minutes of banging on the door my discomfort had increased exponentially, and I had to look for other options. On each side of the door, there were these rows of spherical bushes, and my 6 year old mind saw these as the perfect way to fix my problem. I trundled over to the bushes, pulled down my shiny green basketball shorts and began to relieve myself. What I hadn't realized was that behind the bushes was a window into a 5th grade classroom. Halfway through my deed I hear a commotion inside and see 4 girls laughing and pointing at me. Soon the entire class was laughing and the teacher was moving to phone the office. I then demonstrated an amazing act of stopping mid-stream, pulling up my shorts, and running as fast as my short legs could take me.\nTL;DR:"}

Dad is positive he put a 1 dollar coin on the top of his spare change jar which was now no longer there. He also keeps his back pain medication in the drawer and some of it was missing.\n\nAfter showing me this, my parents told me that 20 dollars had gone missing a few months ago but they didn't want to say anything to me about it.\n\nMy GF is the only other person who was home and has access to the house. A couple of things I should add; she was also kicked out of her mothers house for supposedly stealing money from her mothers boyfriend. She swore to me that she didn't do it and that she was being framed and I believed her. She also spends a large majority of her money on cigarettes and weed and is constantly broke and hitting me up for loans.\n\nObviously it's only a dollar but that's not the point. I don't want to believe that she would go through my dads things and betray mine and my parents trust like that after everything they've done for her, taking her in when she kicked out, giving her home cooked meals every night, etc. I don't know what to do. \n\nThings have been rocky with us the past 3 or 4 months and I've been strongly considering breaking things off.

Susan replies in a sly way \"I'm sorry but Dave is... *indisposed* right now.\" The woman replies \"I wasn't asking if Dave was available, I want to be let in!\"\n\nA few days later another girl rings the front gate, this time at 9pm. \"Hey Matt, can you let me in?\" Susan replies \"Sure, who is this?\" The girl responds hesitantly \"This is Beth.\" \"Beth\" Susan responds, \"you've been replaced. I'm Matt's new girl now.\" This sends Beth into a fury of profanity as Susan hangs up the phone.\n\nSusan and I are hoping that if she keeps screwing with callers that that eventually people will learn to dial the correct number at the front gate.\nTL;DR:"}

Everyone is having a hard time dealing with what has happened, but none more so than my boyfriend.  It has really knocked him for 6.  A few days after me coming home he told me that he couldn't have a relationship with me anymore, that he was experiencing a load of emotions that were really getting him down and that he was having a hard time thinking about me in a romantic and sexual way.  We broke up but continued seeing each other and became a couple again.  \n\nSo here is where it gets tricky.  A week later, he had to fly away to do an important exam that he had been planning for a long time, so I gave him my blessing.  So now we are long distance for at least a month and I am slowly going insane.  Anxiety is eating me up.  I feel like I need him here.  We had a fight, and he told me that his feelings had never changed since he wanted to break up, that he cares for me but not in the same way as before.  So I told him that we should break up but he said that he needs more time, that he cares for me a great deal and that he thinks the pain that I would suffer from breaking up would be greater than the escape and relief that he would feel and that he cares about me a great deal and wants to at try to have a relationship with me.  \n\nI just feel like I'm in limbo, this terrible thing that has happened to me has destroyed my relationship and I'm at a loss as to what to do.  If I break up with him I will be destroyed, I love him completely but then I don't want to have this crippling anxiety drawn out over a few months and then have him tell me that he just doesn't love me in the same way anymore.  I need some advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I trust him completely. He knows all my secrets, and I know his.\n\nNow, despite our relationship going swimmingly, I worry about a number of things almost constantly.\n\n1. He's more than just my boyfriend; he's my best friend. I tell him everything. I'm worried that maybe I'll wind up over-burdening him with my problems. I also hardly spend any time with anyone other than him because I'm really antisocial, and he's the only one I really trust. I find it extremely difficult to make and maintain friendships. I'm a bit of a loner.\n\n2. I find myself constantly checking my email to see if he's messaged me. It's not that I'm worried he's ignoring me or that I'm upset when he hasn't emailed me. It's just that we communicate so frequently that it's become a habit to compulsively check my email unless I know my boyfriend is out and won't be near a computer. Am I an OAG?\n\n3. I'm so afraid that I'll mess this up. I've had problems in the past (been hospitalized for depression, lived in a half-way house for a while, moved out at 18, dysfunctional family, etc.) and even though I'm well now, I'm always worried that if ever I spiral down into the deep dark pits of despair again, I'll either hurt or lose my boyfriend. He makes me so happy, I worry that one day I won't be able to make him happy in return...\nTL;DR:"}

I know I love him with every part of me, but there's a coward in me that's dying to conquer the rational part of me.\n\nI do not know why I became so doubtful of love. Maybe it's because I hear about more relationships failing than succeeding. I also can't stop thinking about how painful it would be if he were to break my heart.

She is my first girlfriend.  When we started out, she showed interest in me first, and seeing that rare opportunity, I approached her on that basis alone (plus she's cute).\n\nWhen we are together, we are intimate.  The sex is good, but I enjoy the pillow talk the most.  I love hearing her say she likes me.\n\nHowever, in groups we are not very close.  She is guarded whenever I try to be close with her around friends.  We're nothing more than acquaintances among friends.  I hate that.  I've brought it up, and she said she does not feel comfortable acting close while with others.  We're still close in public, but distant when someone we know is with us.\n\nWhen we see each other alone, it always involves sex.  We'll occasionally have dinner, but it still ends in sex.  The only time we don't have sex is when we're with others.\n\nI feel like our relationship won't last.  We lasted this long because I like the feeling of having a girlfriend.  I almost feel like anyone will do and I'm only with this girl because she likes me.  I feel like I don't really like her for her.\n\nI want to break up with her, but I'm not sure whether I should trust this feeling.  I know I will regret it and it will hurt.

I don't mind him watching porn in general, but I'm insulted that he'd rather watch porn than have sex with me! I feel like sex has become a routine chore for him. Whenever I try to spice things up in the bedroom, he is very hesitant or says he just isn't feeling like it at the moment. He always says I'm \"so cute\" and \"adorable\", but never seems to think I'm \"sexy\". In the beginning of our relationship I thought he was just shy, or reserved.

We have come to a point where it seems logical to settle down and live together. We have both finished university which previously forced us to live 100 miles apart. It seems logical to go live together, but I don't want to. The underlying reason is that I still feel too young to settle down. If I settle down with her I feel like I have missed out on an important part of being young. I mean the flirting, dating etc. It seems fun to me and a loss to have missed it. \n\nI am scared if I break up with her I will never find someone as nice as her again. \n\nIssues:\n\n**On the positive:** a part of me never wants to lose her, I love her and truly care about her.  I would miss so much of what we have together.  She is truly the sweetest person I have ever met. \n\n**On the negative:** We are both very different people, and I am sometimes scared we both could be happier with someone else more like ourselves. The only reason that it has worked so far is because we are both nice people and really respectfully towards each other's differences. We both dislike each other's hobbies and profession.  Although it isn't a major issue so far it would be nice if we had at least one similar interest. We never had one where not someone needed to compromise. From holidays, clothing style and dinner choices, we have never agreed ever. \n\nI am also scared that our desired lifestyles are so different that we will break up around 30 anyway. I would prefer to be single at 23 than at 30. She desires a simple life, 9 to 5 job, 3 kids and a house near her family. I desire an as exciting life as possible, living in different countries, working in different industries etc.\nTL;DR:"}

I met my current girlfriend in March. We met online and had initially agreed to a mutual fwb type of situation. We had an insane connection, both sexually and mentally, almost immediately. She's exactly what I dreamed a woman could be like, but never knew actually existed. The relationship is better than I could have ever asked for. \n\nAnyway, on to the issue at hand. She moved near me for a master's program and is planning to move away next fall to work on her PhD. I knew this from the beginning and it didn't seem like an issue because what we had was casual. Now that it's more serious, this is becoming a huge dilemma for me. She's still not sure where she'll be accepted, but it will no doubt involve her moving to a new state. I'm torn on all of it. I'm in school myself, finishing an engineering degree, which I'm about 2 years away from finishing. I have been with my employer for 15 years, have a great career, and they're even paying for my schooling. I've been around this area all of my life. All of my friends and family are here. I love this girl more than I thought I would or could, but I don't know that I can make that kind of leap of faith. All I can do is worry about quitting school, leaving a great job and not know where I'll find employment, and other things of the sort. I don't know if it's selfish to think that way or not, but I can't help being extremely hesitant. I've seen people in situations like that make that leap of faith, only to get burnt shortly into it. I keep thinking that as time passes, I'll be able to think more clearly on it, but at the same time, I feel like I may just be wasting her time by investing more into this relationship just to decide that we can't continue once she moves.

But I always told them its not about race at all. But I'm starting to think that might be my problem with her and I feel horrible even saying that. I've always been attracted to dark skinned women, Afros, natural hair, curves. I watch a lot of porn with black women. But I always felt that if I found the right woman, the color of her skin wouldn't matter. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I be honest with how I feel and end the relationship with her? Or do I keep moving forward in hopes of the attraction growing?\nTL;DR:"}

I am a loooong time lurker, but tonight I decided that I might need your help after all. (English is not my main language, sorry for potential mistakes).\n\nMy mom is a fantastic person, Dad left when I was very young and since then she and all of my grandmothers and grandfathers helped raise me. I've had a wonderful childhood and have only fond memories of my family. \n\nIn the latest years, my relationship with mom became a bit strained. We live in different cities and she insists on calling each other 2 times a day, partly to make sure I'm not sleeping in too late and just because she loves me and wants to hear what I have planned for the day. Same thing in the evening, to wish good night and stuff. \n\nSometimes all this calling suffocates me, I feel like she calls me not to hear about my day and listen to me talk about stuff, but rather hear me report about my day and if I did anything productive. Sometimes I don't have a chance to call her in the evening and instead text her where I am and what I'm doing and wishing her a good night. Tonight she got angry and accused me of not caring enough about her (because I texted her). I wouldn't go as far as to call it emotional blackmailing, but she's definitely guilt tripping me. \n\nThere are many other issues with her not fully accepting that I'm an adult and am capable of making my own choices - I live on my own, have recently started paying for everything myself and generally am happy with my life. \n\nI guess my mom thinks that we are too different and that's why it's so hard for her to understand me sometimes. How do I explain to her that different doesn't automatically mean bad or sinful (yeah there's a problem with religion and culture as well, we're from Eastern Europe but we moved 10 years ago. She thinks I'm too westernized now). \n\nI'm an only child so this can also be her having a tough time letting go. Still don't know how to deal with all this.\nTL;DR:"}

After the show we went to a restaurant but at this point I was really tired and in a slightly bad mood because of this. She made a comment about me not finishing my drink and my exact response was \"Yea..and?\" This was a snobby response for sure, but being as tired as I was I didn't think anything of it. For the rest of the evening she was being really short and very aggressive towards me, which I just ignored because I really didn't think it would be a big deal.\n\nThe next morning as soon as I woke up and saw her she started yelling at me about it, and I told her I was sorry and I was really tired and in a bad mood so I didn't think it was that bad of a thing to say.  She was still really angry and asked me if I thought that gave me a right to be a snobby bitch to her, which I responded with \"No, I'm sorry. I didn't think it was that bad.\" I thought that was the end of it so I walked away. \n\nThis was about a week ago and she refuses to speak to me or acknowledge my presence or anything I say to her. I know I was being kind of snobby because I was tired, and I don't think walking away from her when she was angry at me helped either, but because she won't acknowledge me or talk to me I can't even speak to her without her closing her door in my face or interrupting what I'm saying by talking to her dog. \n\nThis is the first time this has ever happened between us and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation. She's taking this situation and making it into a way bigger deal than I think it should be, and because of this I have no idea what to do to make it better or how to even apologize to her. I want to talk to my sister again and for things to be okay but I really don't understand how it got this bad. Because she's ignoring me I can't apologize by saying anything to her.\nTL;DR:"}

I've always accredited it to the birth control she was on, as I know sometimes specific birth controls can mess with you as they alter your natural hormone levels.  We've now been married 2 years and have an 8 month old son and over the course of our marriage may have had sex on an average of once a month.\n\nWe have taken extremely romantic vacations to cities around the world and even on trips like this, it may happen once.  This means no fooling around etc.  I have zero fears that she is cheating on me so I know it isn't that. I've also tried all of the tricks in the book, making her feel special, beautiful, the whole deal.  \n\nI'm definitely the opposite of a neglectful husband.  I also am in better shape and take better care of myself than I did when we got married. (I'm a very modest person, but I do know that it is not a physical issue that I've created. ie. gained wait, grown odd facial hair she doesn't like, whatever.)\n\nThere is also no form of appeasement. Essentially unless it is the 1 night a month and it is time for bed (literally it's time that we would go to bed as if we were just going to sleep) there is zero sexual contact.  It is mostly luck of the draw because she waits until bedtime and by then typically she will be too tired or still need to wash her face, pump (she's still breast feeding), etc.  there's always a reason.\n\nIn any case, does anyone have any idea on how I can promote her sexuality and bring her back to her old self when she didn't hesitate to express her sexuality. She REALLY doesn't even like discussing it or bringing it up. Almost like she's become grossed out by sexuality.  Great sex scenes in movies she even has started to kind of close off during.\nTL;DR:"}

A friend, who you can talk to about your problems, hang out with, and play video games or whatever with anytime. Never in my life did I have a single person that I was able to do those things with. Elementary school, I got made fun of a ton for being fat. Middle school, I just became the quiet lonely Asian kid that nobody ever talked to.

I am healthy both physically, mentally, and financially. I enjoy smoking weed maybe twice a week, and perhaps using psychedelics once a season. As we've continued to date, my girlfriend has become increasingly more uncomfortable with my use, despite my use actually decreasing (we started dating in college, naturally I have begun to settle down). She has been aware of my use the entire time - I've always been very forthcoming.\n\nI tripped at a music festival 'Electric Forest' recently and had a great time - naturally I wanted to tell her about it. She listened, but when I said \"I can't wait for you to come next year\", she sternly said \"no - I don't want to be around you when you do that\".\nI began probing more into her opinions, never really having a true discussion about our boundaries about this subject, trying to understand her viewpoints. She gave me some uncomfortable ultimatums - if we live together, no drugs in the house, and I'm not allowed to do anything around her. On my own time, I can do whatever I want.\n\nThis is troubling to me, and I try to describe this, which led to her becoming extremely upset and saying things like \"I can't believe you're going to choose drugs over me\". She believes she is compromising by letting me do these things on my own time, whereas I think these ultimatums will undoubtedly create a barrier between us.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what I can even do. I feel like she is forcing me to choose between drugs and her, whereas I simply want both. If she tolerated my use, there would be no problem. But I suppose she is 'tolerating' my use in a way. I'm envisioning a future where I have to sneak out of my own house to smoke a joint thinking to myself \"what kind of marriage is that\".\n\nShe is an incredible woman, and really, this is the only thing we've ever fought over. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice. Should I be appreciative of her compromise more, and am I wrong to have anxiety over these ultimatums?\nTL;DR:"}

I don't want to eat or climb out of bed at all. I was very concerned for her these last two months because she was making a lot of alarming and emotionally-overwhelming life decisions post-breakup, which made it nigh impossible to detach myself, and now I'm not sure if she's continuing to break down or if she's suddenly malicious and I need to watch out. She's also living with her rebound boyfriend, who might be manipulating her as he's liked her for 7 years despite never meeting IRL until she moved in, and he \"helped [her] realize what was wrong with our relationship\" back before we broke up. So this could be his doing. Or maybe she wants revenge because she wanted to be friends and I don't. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I possibly deal with this healthily?\nTL;DR:"}

I love her to bits and she seems to return the feelings, but the age difference... \n\n3 years doesn't sound like much, and if we were older then I wouldn't hesitate but she's 16. At the back of my mind all the time is what people are gonna think if I announce I'm going out with a 16 year old, worried they'd think I'm a pervert or something I dunno. But honestly the age difference is the only difference so far, is there any advice you guys could give me?\n\nI thought we could wait until she was 18 but that's 2 years away and by then the both of us could've moved on?\nTL;DR:"}

By that point, I was super into her.\n\nToday, we were in band class with a whole period to goof off, and she's just sitting there with her head down, almost crying. The rest of us just went along with our conversation, pretending like she wasn't even there. And know that the girl I shared the pictures with was also there, and we both were wondering what the hell was going on with her.\n\nA few minutes ago, I got a message from one of the girl's friends. I barely know her, so it surprised me when I got it. She seemed pretty pissed at me, and angry that I showed the pics to my friend. Then, she said that the girl only sent them because she liked me and she broke up with her boyfriend for me. Now, she's super pissed at me and he won't take her back. I'm sitting here feeling like shit beacause I ruined my chance with a girl and broke up her relationship with another guy.\nTL;DR:"}

She now wants to talk about our relationship saying that the nature of our relationship is causing her problems she says she loves me and she sees us being together forever. She has never lied to me before.\n\nNearly exactly one year ago she was having trauma and I found she was being bullied by her friends who then dropped her completely. As a result of this she asked for a break and cut me off completely for a month with about 2 days of notice. Telling me that we were for sure going to end up together. She was telling the truth, we got back together she told me about her bullying problems and the stuff her 'friends' put her through. She didn't sleep with anyone or anything like that during the break and in addition to not speaking to me I found out she stopped speaking to her family (they told me not her).\n\nFast forward to today and she wants to talk about our relationship tomorrow and I feel terrified last time we 'took a break' it crushed me. Luckily I was working at the time so it didnt effect my school work.\n\nTHE QUESTION: How can I deal with a girl whom I love more then anything but when she gets upset tries to shut herself out from the world.

My company's handbook states that full-time exempt employees are expected to provide 30 days notice in order to leave the company in good standing. It also states that, in order to receive your PTO pay out, you are not allowed to take any time off between providing notice and your last day of employment (except for sick days with a doctors note).\n\nThe problem I have is that I have a trip coming up in ~4.5 weeks that I cannot move (immediate family members graduation). Even if I provided 30 days notice today, I wouldn't be able to receive my PTO payout because I need to take vacation days for the trip. What would your recommendation be for this? Do I give 30 days notice and inform my supervisor that I need to take paid time off at the end of my notice period? Do I just give two weeks and start at the new position sooner?

I still enjoy his company and have been spending the night at his place a few days a week. \n\nI am a little conflicted is because he only texts me at night right when he's ready to go to bed. It's not even like a booty call - we just cuddle up and go to sleep. I've texted him about hanging out four times in the last two weeks, during the day, and he said he couldn't all four times. He has his friends over almost everyday, female and male, and he will only text me after they're \"done\" hanging out and he's about to go to sleep. I've met all of the people he has over so I don't think he's embarrassed of me? I even hang out with some of them on a regular basis.

It just doesn't sit right with me, but I am not super sure why.  It's not like around waiting for him to text me all day - I'm pretty busy with school, clubs, friends, and such, so I don't even know why this is bugging me.

I liked her personality, she liked alot of things I liked and really wanted to be with her.

But now that we've gotten closer and I've allowed this friendship to grow beautifully, I find myself developing these feelings of wanting to be with her again. \n\nHowever, like anything I think about (doesn't help anxiety mixes into this), I feel like a relationship between us would never work as I would like it. I'm too proud to admit I'm wrong sometimes and she's too stubborn sometimes. Plus, I'm like a hopeless romantic and (from my knowledge) she isn't really romantic at all.  So, I'd feel like I'm trying to be too romantic and she would just be repulsed by it. (We have also been told by multiple friends of ours that we seem to fight like an old married couple sometimes which may or may not be a bad thing.)There is also the fact that she is abstinent and I'm not really sexually attracted to her (not that I don't find her attractive >.> she is plenty cute).   \n\nSo my question is, could there be a gray area between close friend and relationship that we could try if we ever reach that in the future?

We'll be living apart for about a year, after which point her class schedule will become much more flexible and we will probably move back in together somewhere in between my work and her school.\n#\n**The Problem:** I've been apartment hunting for about a month and haven't been having much luck. Real estate in my area is extremely high, so I can't afford to live on my own. Unfortunately, most of the places that I've looked at have one (or more) of the following problems:    \n1) Roommate is a weirdo.    \n2) Apartment is in terrible condition/in an unsafe area.    \n3) Roommate is a female (or at least one of the roommates are).\n#\nNow, I grew up with sisters, so I don't mind living with girls. I've always found it easier to get along with girls as they tend to be more respectful about common areas, cleaning, and what not. However, my girlfriend is absolutely opposed to me living with a member of the opposite sex.    \nWe've been fighting about this for days, and she keeps saying it isn't \"pure\" and making similarly arbitrary value statements, but she cannot seem to produce even a single logical justification for her stance. She assures me that she trusts me and knows I would never do anything to jeopardize our relationship, but I just can't think of any other reason for her opposition.    \nEven if it is a trust issue, I still don't think she has a leg to stand on. This is my apartment, that I will be paying for myself, so I should be allowed to live with whoever I want. Besides, she specifically asked me not to propose until after her first year of school, so it's not my fault that we're living separately.\n#\n#\nTL;DR:"}

(with bonus problems)\nPOST: Hi everyone.\n\nI've been going out with my boyfriend for 2.5 years, and we have numerous tiffs but, as everyone says, arguments are normal; so I'm not too bothered by it. Also note he has depression, but has been taking medicine and also says that I've been making him feel a lot better.\n\nLately, we've been having a lot of arguments. Recently while going out with friends, I was in a bad mood - not due to anything in particular as far as I can tell, I just felt quite gloomy. My boyfriend told me that I should just \"cheer up\"; and also that my bad mood was ruining the mood of others around me. After I replied that I didn't really think I could cheer up, he said that I only didn't think I could cheer up because I was \"limiting myself\" and that since he could just 'cheer up' even though he had depression, I should be able to as well!\n\nNow, I'm not really sure whether I'm justified in being upset about this. On one hand, I think perhaps he does have a point - maybe I AM just limiting myself and I could be cheered up if I thought that way - but on the other hand, when I'm upset just 'cheering up' isn't something I can do. But then the more I think about that point, the more unsure I am; of course I would think that I can't just \"cheer up\" if I'm limiting how...cheerful I could be.\n\nMoreover I'm also annoyed with this attitude of \"I can do it, therefore so can you!\" And after he told me that I was ruining the moods of people around me I felt even worse. \n\nI don't know if I'm just being overly pessimistic and he is making a valid point. Overall, I'm never really sure whether I'm justified in feeling how I do, or whether my points are valid or not in disagreeing with him here.\nTL;DR:"}

So, I don't care about English or German, but he doesn't like random English terms in German sentences, because he associates them with marketing and other negative or stupid things.\n\nIn other words: I think his reason for not liking English is rather silly - but, it wouldn't be too much of a problem for me to avoid using English words in his presence either. \n\nHowever, for me this is part of a larger problem with other people: I don't like adjusting myself to the beliefs of other people which I consider to be \"idiotic\". Unfortunately, there are a lot of beliefs I consider to be \"idiotic\", such as vegetarianism, religions, feminism, etc... basically, from my point of view almost anyone has at least a few beliefs which I consider stupid or silly. \n\nI want to emphasize that I don't really mind if other people have those beliefs - however, I expect them to respect that I have a different point of view as well: I want to be able to eat meat in the presence of vegetarians, and I want to be able to openly criticize religion and feminism in the presence of people who have a different opinion about these things.\n\nSo... I am not sure, but am I too intolerant or insensitive or something? How do you typically deal with this? Do you just say \"Yeah, whatever...\" and adapt your behavior? Because I somehow don't like feeling restricted by other peoples beliefs, as it feels like a lack mutual respect...\nTL;DR:"}

She said not to worry and showed me a pic of a short weedy guy.\n\nHowever a week or too later she complained she was still having trouble getting used to her dance partner, when i asked why she said because he is much taller than her. I was confused and said I thought he was shorter than you? \"oh, we were forced to swap partners\". She admitted to having a crush on him, finding him smart and cute. I noticed she also had just added him on facebook.\n\nIts been a couple of weeks since then and I noticed her intimacy levels with me are at an all time low. She decided to attend a dance she had previously told me she didnt want to attend.\n\nShe laughed and joked on his facebook wall about his sweaty hands during practice and engaged in light flirting today.\n\nThe dance is on Friday and my next flight there is in ~3 weeks.

I've since moved across the country since I graduated in December, and he graduates in May.  We haven't spoken in about 2 months, but when we did it was short and pleasant.\n\nI've been moving on pretty well--surprisingly well--and hadn't talked about him with anyone for a while.  I told him when we broke up that I thought at least a year of no contact would be best, and then maybe we would try being friends (I've since wondered whether that's something I actually want, but that's another story).\n\nI woke up this morning to a text saying \"Are you kidding me?  You're so shallow its embarassing.\"  I responded \"What?\" and he replied \"You're unbelievable, I'm embarrassed for you.\"  I called him twice and texted back that I had no idea what he was talking about and didn't understand why he was texting me when we hadn't been in contact for months.\n\nIt's been 5 hours now, and he hasn't responded or returned my calls.  A mutual friend went to the gym with him and tried to get an answer but was shut down.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this.  I have no clue what I did (if anything), so I'd like to know what's going on.  I don't want to be in contact, but I also don't want him thinking I'm a shitty person either.  I think of him fondly, but as a memory and with a few bad associations (he tried to hook up with a close friend after we broke up, and I found 2 dating profiles he had used while we were still dating).\n\nStill, I want to clear this up.  It's weighing on my mind.  And I don't want him on my mind.\n\nAny advice is really appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

One of my colleagues had been fired some two weeks ago for reasons undisclosed and was promptly escorted from the premises. The catch is he took care of some business-critical legacy code which apparently compiles properly under Visual C++ 2003 exclusively.\n\nPrior to leaving, he excused himself to \"delete his private data\", which as we learned later was him deleting all his projects and virtual machines. The code is fine in the repository, but the VMs contained configured workspaces for working on the code, which apparently required some project-settings-voodoo.\n\nSo I set out to configure a virtual machine with Visual C++ 2003. It's no longer sold, the only way to get it is throught a MSDN subscription. I recalled him calling Microsoft numerous times trying to activate our MSDN subscription and whatnot, so, a bit let down, I started to retrace what he had done many months earlier and e-mailed our IT dept. for access to MSDN downloads.\n\nThe MSDN trial of tears went on for nearly two weeks until I got my account activated. In the end I found that our subscription does not in fact inlcude Visual C++ 2003 so the two-week-long ordeal had been a waste of time.\n\n*This is not the TIFU though.* When I found that VC++2003 is not available in our subscription I started digging for how exactly this guy came into posession of this thing. After accusing him of piracy in front of my colleagues, I found from a former IT member who now works in another departament that in fact we own a BOX version. Moreover, it should be somewhere in our room.\n\nI rushed to my ex-coworker's desk.\n\nIt was in his drawer. CD's, product key and everything.\nTL;DR:"}

I currently have U-Verse by At&t. I am paying roughly $60 per month and is nowhere satisfied with my service. According to speedtest.net, I am getting, on a good day, [~7.5 MegaBits per second and ~1.5 MegaBits upload speed.] Which is roughly less than 1 MB per second... The main issue is near the evening, the speeds would drop tremendously. Youtube videos would default to 144p video quality on auto quality. 720p will not even play without buffering for at least 10 minutes.. In addition to that dreadful slow speed, sometimes the wifi will simply cut out completely, then come back a few minutes later. Continuous dropping of the internet has occurred more than once per day, let alone per week.\n\nI have contacted At&t before, and after 2 hours on the phone, they guided me through on how to reset the modem. According to the rep, that is what I should do when I encounter slow speeds. (I had to really resist not being extremely sarcastic to the rep on the phone) I have already reset that modem multiple times and it doesn't do jack squat. I know this, but try everything right? \n\n*Side note* The modem is a U-Verse modem, so it's owned by at&t.

[23F]\nPOST: So, I've basically been in long-term relationships since I was 14. I dated my high school sweetheart for 4 years. Dated a guy from the time I was 18 until I was 21. Then dated another guy from the time I was 21 until about 2 months ago. This is the first time I've truly been \"single\", and I actually am enjoying it! I'm loving being able to work on myself, focus on what I want, and not have to worry about anyone else. It's lovely.\n\nNow onto the dating thing. I'm sort of seeing a guy I know, VERY casually. We've gone out for drinks a couple times, gone out with mutual friends, and gone to lunch once. We text a lot and are making plans together often. He's very attractive, nice, educated, and genuine. But for some reason, I'm having a hard time feeling that \"spark\". Maybe it's because I don't know him very well yet. But I can't help but think it's actually because of something to do with me. \n\nSince I was 18 years old, I've only dated 2 men. TWO! And they were both very serious, long-term relationships. For so long I have seen other guys as strictly platonic. Maybe it's because I'm newly single, but why am I not feeling that \"butterflies in my stomach\" feeling for other men? Is this going to last forever? I hope that someday I can feel giddy over a guy again.\n\nI don't know what my question is. I guess I'm looking for input into my situation. Also, should I keep going out with this guy casually and just see where it goes? I do enjoy hanging out with him. Thanks for reading!\nTL;DR:"}

We broke up more than a year ago because we were young and still trying to figure out what we wanted in life and needed to mature I suppose. \n\nWhen we had met in college, we had a great relationship and I can honestly say I haven't met anyone else like her in my life. We've remained friends since, but have both been involved with other people.\n\nFast forward to recently, and within just a few weeks it seems like it's already hard to return to what it once was. I care about her a lot, and I know she does for me too, but she comes from a broken home where trust is obviously an issue for her. Any instance of fighting or her feeling uncomfortable, and she immediately closes off. I'm trying my best to understand the situation she is in and be as supportive as possible, but it's been hard to get through to her because I think she is hesitant to open her heart again to me.\n\nCommunication almost seems impossible, maybe we've truly grown apart, but the hardest thing is that I don't want to lose her now that we've reconciled, and I'm not sure how to show her that this is what I want without her feeling pressured.\n\nI know this has been very general, but any advice from a past experience or a different viewpoint would be greatly appreciated\nTL;DR:"}

But my bf and I moved in together about 3 months ago for financial reasons -- and although it's been so nice and awesome to live with him -- I've been lately feeling like I want to screw other guys. I think that sentiment stems from a feeling of being trapped. He said that he would move out if I told him to, but I don't want to lose him or have him leave either. I really like living with him, but perhaps if he moved out then I would miss him too much to want to screw other guys? This is the first time in our year and a half relationship that I've felt this way or gotten restless with our relationship.... \n\nAs a result, my anxiety is at an all time high. I have nightmares. I don't know what to do -- I've tried thinking through it, but I don't know what to do. Should I break up with him if I'm having these feelings?

But this feeling hasn't gone away, it comes back in waves. Am I actually such an anxious person that I get restless of relationships too easily? Or is this one done for me? We barely ever fight, we're extremely compatible, and he's ALWAYS been there for me. Plus our sex is great. I really do deeply love him and I don't want to lose him. Then why am I so conflicted and eager to do things with other guys? Is all just my anxiety disorder? Someone please help me get out of my head!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm on vacation 6000 miles away with my family and he meets this French exchange student in his class. He tells me shes pretty and nice, i'm whatever about it, it's fine. Couple days later, he springs on me that he wants to break up cuz he can't stop thinking about her and wants to see where it can go with this girl, after knowing her for 3 days. I tell him it's okay if he sees other people, but he definitely won't hear from me ever again. He decides to stay with me, but i'm really traumatized and have lost my trust ever since with him. The thing that happened 1.5 ago has resurfaced, and I feel like i'm back to square one. I can't stand him hanging out with those girls, it's extremely unsettling for me. Seems like whenever a mildly attractive girl shows him any sort of attention, he becomes infatuated and completely blindsided and wants to move on. \n\nMy biggest fear is being hurt again, and i'm lost. Sometimes I wonder if I was an idiot for continuing to tough it out.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (24f) need to know if I am over thinking a dinner my (29m) boyfriend is going to.\nPOST: I have been dating a guy exclusively for about 5 months so it's a pretty new relationship. Around two months in he was telling me about these two sisters he went to high school with. He told me that they were close and that he loves them both dearly. I thought that was sweet. Then he went on to to say that if either one of them had propositioned him for sex or a relationship that he wouldn't hesitate at the chance, which honestly I thought was TMI. Anyways, we didn't bring that up again. Well, they live out of town but this week one of them is coming to visit. She is going to stay at my boyfriend's mom's house because they're all close and what not. Friday my boyfriend is going to go to dinner with this girl and her boyfriend. I'm a little hurt because I didn't get an invite. I'm not sure why that is, and I think I'm starting to drive myself crazy about it. \n\nMy thoughts go something like this: 'Is he embarrassed of me? Does he not want her to know he's dating someone? Does she actually have a boyfriend and he's going to be at the dinner too? If she's close to his heart, why does he not want me to meet her?' \n\nA little history about me, my ex boyfriend of three years cheated on me. Believe it or not,  I had no clue it was going on. Completely blindsided. So I think that could be causing some anxiety about this current situation. It's helpful for me to get some outside opinions.  Thank you all in advance!\nTL;DR:"}

I'll only take home around 20K this following academic year and my fiance is unable to take out more than $10K to cover living expenses since he is also in professional school.\n\nThe problem is, my parents are asking for $1000/month - that's more than half of what I will take home each year!  My fiance and I have tried moving things around our budget and we simply can't afford this amount.  Now my parents are guilt tripping me into taking out more loans (I would have to do this since my fiance is maxed out) to financially support them.  They're telling me things like \"we've sacrificed so much to raise you,\" \"we put you through college,\"  \"we have so many Asian friends whose children DO support them.\"  I want to help them out , but this would clearly be at the risk of my own well being.

It's been great. No regrets. \n\nThing is, America tends to be a joke now and then, and I always thought so too. What I mean with joke is the silly hyped up presidential campaigns we see, the people suing for crazy amounts of money, the gay hate, the you-cant-drink-until-you-are-21 law. The fat people.\n\nThere was plenty to mock about.\n\nI never hated it though, it was just joking around how you do with other countries and stereotyping. Or so I thought. \n\nRecently the drinking age limit has been raised from 16 to 18 in my former country (netherlands) and people have been commenting like 'its going to be like America now' in a negative tone. And they have been shit talking, one guy in particular, about how it's *my* America now, about how bad it is I live there now.\n\nAs if I am no longer a goddamn Dutch guy. Basically it's \"I'm one of *them* now!\"\n\nAnd the fucking thing is, people here are the same as they are back home! Nice, enjoy having a drink. Do their daily lives, try and get by. Most even dislike their government and the games politicians play, just like in any other country. I've met great kind people here. Kind and smart also. \n\nIt made me see the stereotypical jokes really made some of my friends look down on the USA. But its just the crazy people that set the tone for a country, and that's what they see in the news. It just pisses me off so much!\nTL;DR:"}

The problem is that I had moved out of state about 2 weeks after it happend. I didn't leave because I was fearing legal action, I was drifting from house to house with my girlfriend after losing our apartment and her family friends invited us to live with them for a bit. About 4 months after I've already moved to a different state my mom calls me telling me I'm supposed to go to court. We had used the last of our money on train tickets to head out of state so I had no way of getting back to where the court hearing would be. I called the county court house askign what I should do and they gave me the number for the prosecuting attorney and said to talk to him. I called him multiple times every day for a week straight and left multiple messages and never got a call back until finally it was past the day of the hearing. I've been back in the state where the charge was filled for the past couple months and I've been trying to figure out what the fuck to do about this missed court date. How much trouble could I really be in, I'm scared as hell. This is my first run in with the law other then a smoking ticket when I was 16.\nTL;DR:"}

We sat about a foot apart the entire time until she got a little closer and kind of came on to me. I didn't really move but I told her that it's getting late and we should both go back home and she got the hint. I didn't do so much as hug her goodnight and when I got home I felt guilty for putting myself in that position even though I didn't go in with ill intentions.

I took the job about 4-5 months ago with a firm of people I used to work with at another company.  The Firm is great, pays well, good people, lots of perks.  The problem is that this is absolutely not what I wanted when I accepted the position.  I made it clear my focus was \"work-life\" balance but with the customers and projects they have me on, it's not happening.  This is compounded by the fact that I don't want to be doing this type of work and I'm constantly worried about the job (nights, weekends, you name it).\n\nSo I've been thinking of quitting my job, looking for a lower pay and lower stress position.  I'm not sure if I want to do a helpdesk or perhaps retail or something else.  Here are my questions for my fellow redditors:\n\n1. Is it worth it?  I know I'll miss the money, but I have plenty of savings and I'm more concerned about the stress and my happiness.  I'm also trying not to fall into the \"grass is greener\" mentality, but this job almost brought me to tears over the last 3 weeks several times and I can't seem to leave the office at the office.  Also, since I'm not real happy, the people around me can tell and it's effecting them.\n\n2. Since I don't have a specific career change in mind, what advice would you have for me?\n\nMy current plan is to keep my head down until mid-March and re-assess.  That will give me time to save some more money, try and resolve the work issues, and give me a more clear picture of if this is the path I want.  That said, I'd like to know what other thoughts are out there.\nTL;DR:"}

I moved to a shitty rural town to take this job and I'm extremely lonely and I feel like a cultural outsider (I'm much more comfortable in a city, apparently, and I feel like I just don't fit in here in spite of repeated efforts to make friends).  It's also about an hour's drive in any direction to get to small/mid-sized towns with basic amenities.  There is literally no reason to live in this town except for the fact that I'm working this job.\n\nMy job is fucking stressful and involves long hours 8 months of the year.  I don't like my boss and one of my coworkers is regularly corrupt and unethical and it makes me uncomfortable.  The workplace politics and bullshit are worse than the job itself.  I could make you a laundry list of specific reasons my job is terrible, but I'll spare you. \n\nWhenever things get bad I sit around contemplating whether it's a terrible idea to just quit outright and move to Chicago or somewhere and just hope I can land on my feet somehow.  I've been applying for jobs the past 2 months and I had one interview but I haven't heard anything back yet. I'm scared of completely losing my income at a time when the economy is shitty, and I'm worried about losing my health benefits... I'm healthy enough and rarely go to doctors, but I am scared of lacking that \"just-in-case\" security.  I'm generally paranoid and I highly value having security, but I'm starting to feel like my desire to privilege security is costing me big in every other aspect of my life.  \n\nThe plan has been to find another job and THEN quit, but the more I think about enduring this situation indefinitely until that opportunity arises, the more depressed and terrible I feel.

A good story!)\n\nMy dad is a chemist/Head of Research for a very large oil company (we'll call it Derp Oil; potential int'l lawsuits are possible, after they, ironically, now test the product for wrongdoing) who, like many oil companies, deals with oil companies in China (We'll call it China Herp Oil). My dad works in both Derp Oil's lubricant and research department respectively. They've been having issues with with the Chinese company blaming Derp Oil's QC/lubricant department for pipeline issues (clogging, minor explosions, etc.), all the while unable to provide evidence to Derp Oil that they did anything wrong. China Herp Oil is/was unhappy about a possible distancing of the two companies' in terms of shared research, as far as I can tell.\n\nSo long story short, Derp Oil is developing in my dad's research department, a new product with hexanol in the lubricants (not my Dad's idea). China Herp Oil had a deal with Derp Oil to provide this hexanol to Derp Oil. The problem is, they totally trolled Derp Oil's QC department today. The QC department bought and passed on the raw materials to my dad's department without quality checking it. At all. And it is typical in my dad's area to minimize exposure of chemicals to elements and put the tanks into the plant and \"let it run\".  Funny thing... It had some hexanol in it, but it was mostly water. So because of a bit of laziness in terms of paperwork and testing, the plant is shut down as the hexanol, water, and product mix sets up in the plant, and has effectively shut the plant down. 60,000 tons of product is ruined.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: I'm not giving up; my break is over!\nPOST: My resolution this year was to lose weight.  So far I've lost 33.8 pounds.  I came home from college and losing the weight stopped.  I walked less, half heartedly played Wii, and went to snacking.  Overall, I do weigh less than when I got out of school, but I'm just not feeling it.\n\nBut this weekend, I went shopping with my best friends and I was really upset that I wasn't able to buy clothing from the same stores they did. They're both around an 8 or 10 (US Women's pant/dress size) and definitely healthy and average, and I'm about an 18/20, down from a 24.  I had to get bra sized because mine doesn't fit because of the weight loss, and surprisingly I went up a cup, but down around.  Bras are hard.\n\nI don't see my results in my body.  The only noticeable difference I see is in my clavicles.  My friends and my mother say differently (I wish I was bold enough to post pictures, but sadly, I'm not).  Does anyone else feel like this, even having lost a large amount of weight?\n\nMy original goal was to be at -50 lbs by the time school starts, which is the end of August.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to lose over 15 lbs by next month, but I'm certainly going to try my hardest.  Today I got up at 8:15 am to try and beat the heat while out walking 3 miles.  Tomorrow I'm going to get up at 7:15 to do it again, and hopefully not get so burnt.  This isn't the ideal way I thought I'd be spending the last few weeks of summer, but **I want this**.  And as much as I'd rather sleep in, I'd rather weigh less a whole lot more.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Need advice on roommate's dog\nPOST: So I have known my roommate for a long time, and he has brought over his dog when it was a puppy to my old place quite a few times. I recently moved into his place because of some financial situations (moving out would hurt not only me, but him). I've owned a few dogs in my lifetime, but all as a child. So, I'm not really too sure how to go about this. The issue at the moment is when I come home, or step out of my room, she will run towards me, and try to jump onto me. Constantly. So, with what little knowledge I have of dog training from when I was a child, I would tell her to sit. This seems to have worked for a few days. I come home, she runs at me and jumps once or twice, I tell her to sit, and she would sit. I would pet her. Seems all fine and dandy. Well now she has taken to barking at me after I pet her. I'm not the owner of the dog, and I'm just trying to make this an easy adjustment for the three of us. However, I am at a lost of what more I could do. I am fairly certain she just wants my attention, and that is fine. However, I don't want to sit there after I get home from work and pet her for hours (exaggeration). Of course my roommate is not oblivious to her behavior, and tries to get her attention when I come home. She does not seem to care at all. Any feedback will be appreciated, even if it is a direct attack on what I am doing.\nTL;DR:"}

Now I am so excited and happy for her genuinely, buuuut she has to kiss another guy in the play as part of her 2 shows as the main main female charcter (she gets married). \n\nSo currently I'm okay with it, but I know each day that goes by it's going to eat away at me and when I watch it will probably not be good. I don't want it to effect our relationship because I am acting out ect and I'm not worried at all that she'll leave me for this other guy because currently she is more concerned about kissing another guy then I am.\n\nQuestion is: Have any of you had a situation where your SO was ment to (allowed) to kiss (or more) another person and you had to accept it, how did you accept it? Or any advise on how I should accept it becuase once they start practising kissing I feel I'll instantly be off with her , no matter how hard I try.\nTL;DR:"}

She's a very busy person with schooling, volunteers, work and friends but we were getting along great. I have been in the dating pool for a few months now and have dated lots of people, none have ever clicked as well as this girl and I did. On our 8th date I asked her if she'd like to be exclusive, she said she did, we both seemed to really like eachother and that made me pretty stoked. Well, since then we've seen each other twice for like a grand total of four hours. She's busy and I knew that going into it, but on top of her being busy, she doesn't seem to want to try and organize anything in general. \n\nSince we've started dating I've asked her if she wanted to hang out 5 times in 2 weeks, she's said she is busy 4 of those times and has only agreed once. She will apologize for not being able to hang out but won't try to reschedule. It makes me feel fairly rejected and I'm not happy with it at all. I've stopped asking her to hang out in hopes that she'll be the one to initiate it and nothing has happened yet. Earlier today I was particularly wanting to be flirty and try to engage something so I texted her, \"You still owe me that kiss\" (she does) and she replied \"I'm sorry\". I haven't even responded to it because it feels like it's just on a loop.\n\nI can't ask her to change her life and I don't want to make her feel bad about it. How do I go about fixing this? Do I talk to her and say that I need her to be more clear about when she can spend time with me? Isn't that demanding?

I was happy with what I was able to accomplish and I was able to get across some much bottled up feelings.

This is about how the education system is completely flawed.\n\nI am currently a high school student in the United States, and have come to realize that high school is a waste.\n\nI have grown up with the mentality that college and university is the path to success, and to get there, you have to get grades in high school. If you don't, you can end up and a community college and end up being a nobody, making minimum wage for the rest of your life and never being able to afford the better things in life.\n\nFor a high school student like me, everything is for college, and grades are the largest factor. You must have a high GPA, which means you must strive to get A's in all your classes. \n\nBut how do you get an A? In many of my classes, it doesn't mean the most diligent person or the smartest. A's aren't just earned by people who study the most or who come in before and after school. A's are earned by the best memorizers, the best cheaters, the best test takers, and the best ass kissers. \n\nNo longer is it about understanding the material and asking why. It is about knowing a formula, and being a robot. None of my teachers ask me to question things, they just lecture about syntax and structure. This applies to almost all of my classes.\n\nMaybe it's just because I'm a teenager and haven't seen the bigger picture yet, but in high school, or school in general, I've only been taught formulas. I don't know why or how they work, but I've been taught that I need to memorize them.\nTL;DR:"}

After a few weeks of this I can't deal with not have her as more than just friends with benefits. We go for coffee and I let her know exactly how I feel. Her response was great, she said she felt the same way but the reason that she had wanted to just be friends was that she didn't want to string me along while she is so far away. She was ecstatic that I felt the same way as her. We talked some more and decided we would try to do a long distance relationship with some traveling back and forth through out the year and then re-evaluating later on.\n\nThe problem comes from my study, I am midway through a pre medicine science degree, I have two more years left in my degree and I am intending on following her over and doing my medicine degree there, she also knows this. My fear is that I will not be able to handle not being able to see her on a regular basis and whether it will be worth it in the end, will we hype up our relationship so much that it can not fulfill our expectations.

All of them ended up as just a fun night out with a friend. \n\n   Then I went out with \"rose\" and we clicked instantly right away. It's been a great couple months but I'm starting to feel like I need to see more of her. We see each other maybe once or twice a week but talk constantly via text and snapchat. \n\nMain issue here is I'm not sure whats normal... I've never dated. I was in a 7 year relationship that started in high school, then after that I was in a marriage for 6 years. Now I find myself in a weird situation where I was used to seeing my SO every day and being able to hug/kiss someone basically whenever I want to. Whereas now I see my GF once or twice a week and I'm having a hard time feeling like that's enough. \n\nAm I asking too much to see each other more often since we've only been seeing each other for a couple months? \n\nIs it normal to have this much of an attraction towards someone you just met or am I the \"overly attached boyfriend\"?\n\nIs this something that I specifically need to work on or is it just that we might not be compatible relationship wise? Are there other people that feel the way I do?\n\nwe're supposed to meet today after work to discuss our expectations. I don't know if we're on the same page.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [26M] with my FWB [26F] of 3 months, both developed feelings...\nPOST: Hi /r/relationships,\n\nOver the past few months I [26M] have been FWB with a friend [26F] who I've known for about a year. About a week ago she told me she has developed feelings for me. Initially I was unsure about my feelings for her or if I was ready to start a relationship (had a pretty devastating breakup early last year), but I really like this girl and am stupidly happy whenever I spend time with her. It hasn't been a 'typical' FWB relationship thus far I guess, there's a lot of intimacy and we get along really well, she is amazing, the kind of person I've always wanted to spend my life with. \n\nShe was apprehensive of believing the feelings are mutual and thought that I only want to try out of 'convenience' once she confessed her feelings to me (that I was only interested in the sex and that I would rather be with someone instead of being alone, even if I didn't have an emotional attachment). But we've worked past that and have begun talking about whether we should take it further and try a relationship.\n\nBut... There's a catch. At the end of this year (or very early next year), she will be leaving the US indefinitely for further studies. She wouldn't be coming back for 4-5 years at the earliest and I love my job/career and there is no chance of me moving. Before you start thinking \"woah hey, you guys haven't even started technically dating, that's a long time away...\" we both aren't really the short term relationship types and have agreed that we can see each other 'falling in love' - if that hasn't started already.\n\nSo, I guess we're at a crossroads. There's way too much attachment and all that to just keep it as FWB. I'm very confused about what to do. Part of me wants to just do it and enjoy whatever time we get together. But, I really don't know if I can handle saying goodbye again to somebody I love in that way, it took me quite a while to recover from my last relationship.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/loseit\nTITLE: Something I learned about being overweight with hip pain\nPOST: I'm a beginner, but I thought I'd share this in case it helps anyone else(5'2 F 270lbs). My hips have given me problems for years when doing strenuous activity, and I thought that having these issues would make working out very difficult if not impossible (because I thought it was a joint/bone issue due to being overweight). I went last night to my first personal training session, and learned about working the \"core\", which is essentially the torso and hips (helps with balance and is apparently crucial to working up strength and flexibility in these areas as a strong base). As I expected, my hip hurt extremely bad and I had to stop a few times. The trainer showed me a couple of stretches and pulled out this \"roller bar\" (essentially a 5 foot long, 8\" in diameter hard piece of foam). I sat on it and rolled to my side and dug the bar into my hip until I felt the painful spots, and then rolled back and forth on it over the area with most pain. It hurt like hell, but it seriously lessened the pain (after I was done rolling on it) and made me able to finish the work out. Before trying the bar, I felt like I could barely stand up. Afterwards, the difference was amazing. I could still feel some ache in my hip, but not nearly as bad and I no longer felt like I was going to collapse if I didn't sit down. So basically I'm just saying that hip pain could be due to the lack of muscle use and flexibility, and not just \"I have joint pain because I'm a fatty\" like I thought. I wanted to share this because the hip pain really dissuaded me for a looong time to take the step of starting a workout, and having found this out on the first trip to the trainer, was an amazing revelation to me and makes me feel so much better about continuing this journey. Anyone else notice anything similar during their journey?\nTL;DR:"}

Also found myself denying that I love her, but, maybe I really do?\n\nAnyway, we haven't really done much together, if at all. From what I remember, there's the excursion with other friends to some fun place (BOUNCEinc), and a dinner *\"date\"* (what makes something a date anyway?), but that's it. I do/did try to converse with her through IM, but it's never satisfying because she *always* stops responding without warning (I presume she's just busy whenever that happens, but maybe I'm fooling myself? I mean, the notifications are *right there*, wth?)\n\nFast forward a year later, to now, still wondering if I should tell her, and when. The doubt is mostly because we haven't interacted much and I feel it might make the situation.....awkward, but also because I suspect she's already in a relationship (not certain).\n\nRight now, I'm thinking of calling her up and offering my time to chat over some coffee or something; see how that goes.\n\nSo, what should I do? Confess? Don't speak of it? Talk her into some night(s) out? Am I even playing the dating game (right)?\n\n##context\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not sure about the UK either, and we both agreed it would be easier if she came to the UK if she was going to keep the child. I live with flatmates but I could move back home with my mum because she has a home with extra rooms, it's about an hour commute but I could deal. \n\nI support whatever decision she wants but she feels like she'll be ruining our lives if she keeps the child. I can tell she wants to, I don't mind I guess. I never wanted to be a dad at 20 but I'll do my best. If she got an abortion that would be okay too and honestly preferable. I'm not sure what to say but I'm trying to comfort her, she's been really depressed since she told me.\nTL;DR:"}

Occasionally, the conversation came up that we would have kids in our mid- to late- 20s. (25-27). Fast forward to today (both 27 now), and last year I told her that I did not want to have kids at all. I had been thinking about this for a bit, and I cannot ever really see myself having children. \n\nThis set her back, and we obviously had a very serious conversation about it. She came back and said that she was also sure she didn't want children *right now*, and if (when?) the time came we would have to have that conversation again. \n\nNow, I'm perfectly happy and fine being child free. It took me a lot of time to come to this decision. However, I now am super concerned that my wife and I will probably end our relationship at some point in the near future when she decides she does want to have children. I'm not sure how to talk about this point because when we do talk about kids, she reminds me that she's sure she doesn't want children *right now*. \n\nI'm also torn with a bit of guilt because we never really discussed this when we were younger (again, young and dumb), and both of us just naturally assumed children would happen one day (because that's what good boys and girls do). \n\nI want some closure, as this is really heavy on me, but I can't push her into a decision on this point.

Fast forward to last night, and I was 4 miles into my 9-mile run. My hips were aching, my willpower was fading, and I wanted so badly to quit. Then something inside of me snapped, and I got angry. I was tired of feeling like a victim. I was tired of letting my body hold me back. I was tired of struggling through my runs. I was just plain pissed off, so I unleashed. Normally, I run a 10:00-10:30 pace for my longer runs, which I had been doing for the first 4 miles. But then I took off and ran the next 4 miles at a sub-9:00 pace. For about a mile, my GPS watch said I was running close to an 8:00 pace, which is pretty rare for me. And you know what? It felt **awesome.** All my aches and pains went away, and for the first time in a long time, I felt strong. I felt invincible. Maybe it's cheesy, but I felt like Forrest Gump during the scene when he starts running and his leg braces break off and fall away. My husband was running with me, and he was like, what happened to you?? I told him I was pissed off, and he told me I should run angry more often. :) That 9-mile run gave me more confidence than my 18-miler. Go figure.\nTL;DR:"}

First of all, we are from two different countries, and from two completely different cultures. Mostly this have been a blessing and not a problem. Our parents aren't that cool with out relationship and that's were our first problem lays. Our second and bigger problem is that at the moment and for a long time now, we haven't lived in the same country. Sure, we live like 1 hour airplane ride from eachother, but we don't meet up as much as we should, mostly cause of studies/work. \n\nDuring this summer, I sat down and talked to my girlfriend about that I felt that we need to make some things about this relationship clear, the point I took up were:\nAre we willing to give up our ties with our families for this relationship?\nWill we ever be able to live in the same country again? How many more years could we waste before knowing for sure? I told her that I don't really want to spend 3 more years on a relationship if we can't clear things up, that even if I loved her, I didn't know if our relationship would hold up just on that.\n\nI love my family, and we grew up in a war-ridden country so our bond is very strong. Also after that we migrated, we had a lot of troubles growing up, so I would like to give them as little trouble as possible.\nTL;DR:"}

We got kitten who is now a full grown cat. Now before we even moved in together I told her I did not want her dog in the apartment. He's a chihuahua and has always been an outside dog. I don't like chihuahuas at all. She knows this and has known this sense we met. A little over a month ago I got us another kitten so now we had two. With this I agreed to give her dog a try.\n\nTwo days ago she bought the paperwork she needed to bring the dog into our apartment as the landlord doesn't allow dogs but can't deny him with this paperwork. She brought him here the next day. This dog only is ever quite if she's home. If she's not he yaps for hours. That and he attacks our cats and she's seen it but does nothing but defend him.  He refuses to use the bathroom outside because \"your watching him.\" If he continues to piss in the house we'll lose to deposit due to damage. (Not that they'll likely give it to us now anyway knowing there is a dog here.) \n\nI'm trying to give this dog a chance despite how much I dislike him. But it's been two days and the yapping when she's gone at work is getting old (we work opposite shifts.). The whole reason we got the cats was so she'd have a pet and now I have to deal with this dog I didn't want. But I love her so I'm really trying to give it a chance.

I am interested in the subject, but it hasn't lit a fire under me or anything. I don't look forward to attending lectures, completing assignments on time if even at all, etc.\nI am one and a half years into a four year program. \n\nMy second issue is that I don't like where I live anymore. I grew up in this city and I've just found that as time passes I find myself wanting to leave more and more. I have no friends (literally) in this city and nearly my whole family is estranged from me. The only person that holds me to this place is my boyfriend. \n\nI've had starry eyes for another place entirely. I still want to go to school, but I feel in confident at this time because of my lack of motivation and sort of \"lost\" feeling. I also don't have a great job so money is always an issue. \n\nSo I'm basically seeking advice on what I should do. I haven't invested a lot of time and money (as far as university goes) into school so in my mind I can justify changing programs. As I mentioned money isn't the greatest so I am scared to move away and lastly, I haven't the slightest idea on how to plan for something like this. I don't know where I should look, if I should try to lock down a job, etc.\n\nFor terms of scale on the move that I would like to make:\nI live in Ontario in Canada. I would like to move to either Alberta or British Columbia. It's like basically going across all of Canada.\n\nAnyways, literally ANY advice will help me. Thank you very much.\nTL;DR:"}

I have always been puzzled by this phrase. If she did not want anything to do with me, why did she bother including that phrase and basically tease me with any hopeful thoughts. Wouldn't it be more efficient to be direct and cut contact entirely? Is this just a method to make someone feel better about themselves?\n\n2) Why would she also tell me if I needed anything that she is there for me? We are no longer in a relationship, we are nothing but acquaintances so why bother telling me that. She is not obliged to help me and frankly, I am not either.\n\n3) I accept the fact that nothing will come about between us. However, I have lost contact with a lot of really great women in the past just because I was either too afraid or had a large sense of pride to continue seeing that person as \"friends\". Would it be pathetic on my behalf to continue seeing her even though something went on previously between us?\nTL;DR:"}

I feel that we are a really good match for one another and can honestly see this relationship reach new heights.\n\nThat being said, she had one major boyfriend before me and she dated him for 3 years, but with a couple breakups.  She wasn't exactly faithful to him, having cheated on him a few times.  What's worse is that he only knew about the first time and decided to forgive her for it.  Admittedly, their relationship was strained because he went off to college while she was still in high school, but that doesn't excuse her actions in my opinion.  \n\nShe tells me that I'm a much better boyfriend than her ex was and that she was unhappy when she cheated on him.  But she seems to blame him for her unhappiness at the time and not take responsibility for her actions.  She seems ashamed of what she did, but she never admits total responsibility for her actions.  This bothers me, because I don't feel like she was really sorry for what she did.  We have talked about this before, but I feel like I'm trying to make her feel bad about herself.\n\nThe reason this has been bothering me lately is because she has been out of the country on a trip.  She tells me that she could never dream about cheating on me because I'm so perfect, but I feel like that isn't the response I want to hear.  I'm very conflicted.  I completely trust her and feel like I shouldn't worry, but this small part of me is scared.  I have strong feelings for her and I am worried that I am going to get too attached before I get my heart broken one day.

I can't seem to figure out anything I actually enjoy doing that I'm skilled at besides video games. I wanted to play Halo in the MLG Pro Circuit but financial issues have kept me from it for years. Now I'm at a dead end, trying to figure out something I might really enjoy trying out, because I had to sell my Xbox last week for rent. Now, when I'm not working my min. wage job because of a shitty web market where I am, I'm sitting in my room reading or catching up on TV shows(lazy American, fuck yeah!).\nTL;DR:"}

I hit 150 bpm almost as soon as I start running, and it's between 170 and 180 bpm in the last 5 minute run segment. And I'm running *very* slowly.\n\nI'm not overweight. I'm 5'10\" and 160 lbs. I lift weights, nothing impressive, but the point is I'm not exactly a couch potato. Blood pressure's good, cholesterol's good, iron level are sometimes low so I take supplements.   \n\nI'm concerned with the high heart rate because (a) it seems a little dangerous, (b) I might just be training my anaerobic capacity and not building basic endurance.  \n\nIf I walk at 4 mph my average heart rate is 128 bpm. Walking feels easy - too easy - I can keep going for more than an hour and it doesn't seem like I'll make any progress just walking. (Also it's boring.)\n\nMaybe my max heart rate is just higher than normal. Does that happen? Should I do some sprints, find out what my *real* max is, and based my training zones off that? Does anyone actually test their max rate or does everyone use formulas like 220-age, or 180-age?\nTL;DR:"}

She stole things from him, and she never really gave him a real explanation.    \n\nBut that was over a year ago. Since then, we started dating, and things have been going well.

It's not that significant when compared to some people, but to me, it has been quite a while, and we haven't really faced many issues up until recently. See, I live in Iceland and she is from the UK. We're both in college and we're both finishing up, and with that said we haven't gotten that long till we can actually move in together. But her patience and the distant got the best of her, and she ended up kissing another guy. I do admit that we hadn't been as close as usual, and we were apart for more then the usual amounts. But this kiss destroyed me, and it destroyed her. She told me that she regret it, and that she doesn't have feelings for him, but then she said that she couldn't guarantee this from never happening again, and I'm really worried on how I should react to this matter, as it almost tore us apart and it really made me lose a lot of trust in her.\nTL;DR:"}

She doesn't really make any effort to close the curtains or shut the blinds, and I'm certain that she knows how easy it is to look into an apartment when it is dark outside, and all of the lights are on. (Though the windows/glass doors in our apartment do not face any particularly busy roads, they are still trafficked on a semi-regularly basis, so there's certainly a risk of being exposed.) I put the term pajamas in quotation marks because she tends to walk around in her bra and a thong... \n\nWhile I love that my SO is comfortable with her body, and think she looks beautiful in her \"pajamas\" of choice, I'm less enthused by the fact that she seems to be okay with random passerby catching a glimpse. On one such occasion, I jokingly asked her, \"Aren't you going to close the blinds before you take your clothes off?\", and she just sort of shrugged her shoulders. I find this hurtful, as I do not think that it is appropriate for other men to see my SO in her underwear, or for other women to see me in any state of undress. (I realize that this might make me \"old-fashioned\", but everyone has their own understanding of what is and isn't \"exclusive\" within a relationship, and this is something that is important to me.)\n\nAm I being totally unreasonable, or am I justified in being uncomfortable with this?

While we never had the DTR talk, I would say our relationship was non-exclusive and primarily based on sex (we both kept our online dating profiles active, which is how I'm sure there was a mutual understanding it was non-exclusive). We'd see each other once a month at most. Starting late last summer, I gradually felt him getting distant- he wasn't contacting me as much, didn't really seem too eager to hang out or do things outside of sex, etc. Eventually, I \"took the hint\" and stopped reaching out to him myself. I haven't seen him since January of this year and he hasn't asked me out since then. I assumed the relationship was over.\n\nIn the meantime, I've started seeing another guy (Guy B) for a few months. Yesterday, I Instagrammed a photo of us together which is linked to my FB account. A little later I received a message on FB from Guy A saying, \"You have a boyfriend??\" Then last night I got a missed call from him, plus another one late this morning.\n\nNeedless to say I'm pretty alarmed, so I haven't responded yet. Why the hell would Guy A, who I assumed stopped caring about me months ago, suddenly freak out at me seeing someone else?\nTL;DR:"}

He lied about it for six months.\nPOST: Last January, my 21 year old boyfriend went to a birthday party at a friends house. I saw him untag himself from pictures with a woman shortly after they were uploaded on Facebook which made me suspicious. I asked him about the party and if there was anything he'd like to share, but he kept denying. A few months later (after I persistently harassed him) he mentioned that there was a stripper there. He was extremely defensive and angry when I asked if he got a lap dance and said he only watched. \n\nWe had a lot of trust issues before that, with him lying about drugs at raves and parties. Because of that, I didn't trust him when he said he just watched so I brought it up again and again. Eventually, he told me he got a lap dance (in June -6 months after the event). \n\nI've been trying very hard to get over it. I asked him specific details about the event. Imagined it play out in my head. He said he was pressured into it and didn't want it. He felt bad and gross afterwards. I felt extremely sad knowing another woman had her body on top of his. After all that though, I feel like it's not even the stripper that bugs me.\n\nI'm an extremely liberal person with a high libido and I love sex. I'm not against having fun occasionally and strippers aren't the worst thing (I'd even consider going to a strip club WITH him). I feel like I was betrayed because of the length of the lie though. \n\nHe's apologized and I feel a little bad for him because neither one of us enjoyed that this happened. It's just a huge obstacle in trying to move forward though. We've tried to make new rules and discuss borders in our relationship which has helped, I don't think he's lied to me about anything since that event.\nIt's still hard to trust him though, I feel like the honesty is lost and I don't know how to get over this.\nTL;DR:"}

Looking for advice on how to make a good impression when I study there!\nPOST: I'll be studying abroad in Port Elizabeth, South Africa from July to November.  I'm very excited for it, but I'm also really nervous.  I'm most nervous about unknowingly doing something or acting in a way that makes people dislike me or think I am rude/annoying/stupid etc.\n\nSo my question for reddit is this:  what are some actions, styles, behaviors that would cause South African people to view me negatively?  Especially things that a visitor might not realize.  I know this a broad question...here are two examples.  In some European countries people wearing white shoes, or Nike or athletic apparel are considered low class/poor.  In Japan you should hand and receive a business card with both hands, not just one.  I love wearing white shoes and sometimes wear Nike so I wouldn't think to view it as low class.  I usually take a business card with one hand cause it's easier.  If I went to these places, such behaviors would have negative outcomes.\nSo yeah, I want to be a respectful traveler/visitor, but every culture has different assumptions and interpretations of good behavior.  If there is anybody from South Africa that could share some of those assumptions with me I'd be very grateful!\nTL;DR:"}

She had never been in a real relationship before though and after 3 months she panicked about it all and we broke up for a month or so before getting back together. We've been going strong since other than this one issue, which is her getting a job.\n\nShe has a really sweet deal on the place she is living in but the end of her money is coming up and likely wont be able to pay January's rent and will have to move back to her family 600+ miles away. I've not minded being a sugar daddy when it comes to pay for us to go out to eat or activities since money isn't really much of an issue for me. But I have told her that I don't think it is good for either of us if I help her out with rent money and such.\n\nIf she had a job, and a way to pay me back, and was short due to something like car repair or the like, I'd help her out in a heartbeat. But I don't think it is fair to me, nor will it help motivate her to get a job if I help her out in this situation.\n\nShe is really smart, has a degree but her field is rather saturated and hard to get into without previous experience. I'm pretty sure if she went back to school to get some more specific skills for her field her parents would gladly help her out as her family is very well off and values higher education quite a bit. She's definitely been applying places, and she's been teaching herself chess from books as well as advancing at playing piano.\n\nThings aren't looking good for us, I'm not sure if I could/should continue the relationship as a long distance thing if she is forced to move home. I am really into her, I even flew down to meet her family for Thanksgiving with her. But long distance relationships aren't really my thing. Am I justified if I break it off with her if she is forced to move?\nTL;DR:"}

She has not left my parent's property for around 6 months except for late night runs to Meijer or the gas station.\n\nShe also is a former addict (heron) with some kind of emotional disorder. Shit runs pretty deep in our family, bi-polars and schizophrenics all over the place.\n\nFour years ago she had a break and had to move in to my parents' home (they are retired now.) She helps around the house and pays rent with her SS payments, something the rents decided on after several attempts to get her back on her own.\n\nShe has had a few part time jobs in the past years and it really helped her to get out and meet people and live some kind of normal life.

Of course this is bullshit she tells us to make it seem like she is trying to get better.\n\nBefore her last hospitalization she weighed maybe 90 lbs. She now has put on some weight due to her liver not functioning correctly. This has led to her felling even worse about how she looks.\n\nWe are very concerned about her. While I didn't mention this to my parents, I feel like she is going to maybe not be with us for very much longer. We need to do something.\n\nWhen confronted about these issues she become very defensive and clams up/cries/blames others. Trying to get things through to her is pretty useless. When talking to the rents this weekend, I mentioned getting a professional mediator that can help us do an intervention.

He was an Australian Shepard-Mix, and he was fucking awesome. When I was younger and didn't have many friends, he was always there for me to hang out and play with and as I grew older he was still there for me. I have no way to describe the bond between a man and his dog, but I truly understand where the saying \"man's best friend\" comes from now. \n\nFast forward 15 years and things have taken a toll for the worse (obviously). He's had a problem with his hips for about 3-4 years which required him to take aspirin, but apart from the occasional slip-up (read: legs giving out on him) he did fine. I noticed he was getting around more gingerly about last year, but he still seemed happy, had an appetite, etc. but he still only had the occasional accident. Two days ago I woke up in the morning to find that he had pissed himself at night and was unable to get up out of his dog bed. I picked him up, washed him, and kept an eye on him for the rest of the day. All was well, but he seemed really weak. Today the same thing happened, except even after I had picked him up and cleaned him he wasn't able to do anything. He could stand for a bit, only to succumb and lie down. He seems miserable, but I don't know if I can't justify putting him down. I don't want to betray his trust, I don't want to be the last thing he sees before he's put down--I don't want him to realize that I've killed him. At the same time I want to be there for him, like a good owner should. It should be mentioned that I still live at home and this is a family issue, it seems that my parents are leaning towards putting him down. How am I supposed to cope with the loss of my longest companion? Am I justified in putting him to sleep?

He was also being pretty nasty right back when I confronted him and he wouldn't even apologize initially. Later, he actually did sort of apologize and expressed regret for sleeping with the other girl, but still wouldn't really take responsibility for what he did, so I continued to be kind of mean in my responses.

As in daily, maybe even more than that. But recently, the past year, the frequency has been going downhill. Whenever we do have sex, it's AMAZING. He's pleasured, I'm pleasured, we're extremely connected. We shake it up and try new things. It makes me feel incredible, vice versa.

And they decided that we'd train together once a week. I was nervous about our run today. Terrified, in fact, because I didn't know what would happen if I couldn't keep up. They didn't tell me how far we were running or how long (mainly because there was no plan other than to run lol). \n\nWhen we started, I pushed myself to keep up. My speed was close to theirs and surprisingly faster than I had ever ran before (1st mile at 9:39min/mi). But as the distance increased, my speed decreased (slowest at 13:21min/mi). Next thing I knew, I was lagging so much behind. But because I didn't want to look like a loser, I forced myself to keep on running regardless of how tired I was.

We currently live separately and will remain this way until we're married. She owns her home, but is content selling or renting out the space. I'd like to avoid planning to move into her home as it is around 85 miles (An hour and a half) each way to work from that location. I love my work, company, culture, and career opportunities with this company and switching jobs is out of the question. Working from home or remotely isn't an option with my job. The wedding is in about 6 months.\n\nWe plan to move to a different spot on the country once I'm fully vested and she's finished with her degree in just about 2 years. With that in mind, I see my options as the following: \n\n* Move into my own apartment where she can move into once we're married.\n* Purchase a home\n\nBoth of us prefer homes over apartments and I'd like to live in a space without a roommate ASAP. With this: Is there any instance when owning a house for 2 years makes sense? I'd be purchasing in the suburbs outside of Philly (NJ side). I have cash to be able to make a 10% down payment available. No debts, maxed out Roth IRA, 12% + 3% company match 401k, and an emergency fund that wouldn't be touched. \nI've read [this] post by /u/keevenowski which helped identify the costs.

However, I am constantly paranoid about them getting in trouble, getting sick, or anything else.\n\nI really don't like being home with them when they drink (it's loud, unpleasant, and I am always worried that they might get sick everywhere--happened before). But I also don't like being away when they are drinking because I want to have someone responsible and sober there with them to make sure things are okay. We also have a dog, so it's a big hassle to spend the night elsewhere with him (no way I am leaving him alone when they are drinking).\n\nI know it's not unreasonable for him to have friends over and have fun, but I think they are too irresponsible and loud when they drink--my boyfriend disagrees and also points out how infrequently it happens. It always leads to a fight and both of us unhappy--I am still stressed out about the drinking, and then I interrupt their fun by being upset. How do I avoid arguments over this?

He (28) and I (28F) are about to try a long-distance thing, as I will be leaving for school at a city 1.5 hours away.  I will be gone at least a year, perhaps a few months more.\n\nIn short, I don't think he will be faithful.  I can't say that he's cheated before, but he has a history of lying about other girls he knows, and not telling people at work that he's in a relationship.  He flirts (lightly) on facebook and through texts to co-workers.  Nothing overtly sexual, but definitely suggestive.  His culture (Middle Eastern) is very accepting of male infidelity, and although he says *he* doesn't condone cheating, he admires figures like Bill Clinton for being \"real men\" and sleeping around.\n\nOn the other hand, he talks about wanting to spend the rest of his life with me.  I don't think he means this, and frankly, I don't think we'll make it another 12 months.  It feels like an ice pick in my chest, but I can't lie to myself.\n\nSo, my question is this:  Do I emotionally separate, \"pretend\" like we're doing something long-distance, and carry on with my life?  Presumably, it would be a \"don't-ask-don't-tell\" situation.  Or, should I break it off now?  And what should I say?  Should I be honest, or give him the \"let's go out on a high note\" talk?  Or, am I being paranoid?\n\nI thought I loved this man.  It's really killing me.  But, my instincts are telling me to get away.\nTL;DR:"}

My ex and I broke up in April because we had different futures in mind. It was an extremely hard breakup because we were still so in love but had to end it after 3 years because there was no middle ground that could be reached on issues for the future. Although I will always have a special place in my heart for him, I honestly am over my ex and feel as if I am ready to date again. . I have been on a number of dates, and basically have met a bunch of really nice guys but in the end I havent found any interest in any of them. \n\nHowever recently there was this guy who works next door to my job and I was very attracted to and thought maybe this guy could break this stupid chain. So he was a bit harder to get which drew me to him, but after a few days I could tell he was very interested, and I swear to you, as soon as I realized that I didn't want him anymore. And I know how messed up that sounds. So I tried to shake that off and see if maybe I kept hanging out with him that maybe things would change. But the more serious things get, the less interested I become. I dont know what is wrong with me. Now I feel as if we should end things before they go any further but I feel terrible because I got him to really like me, and I can tell he is falling for me and will probably ask me out soon. \n\nDont get me wrong, I do like him, but I just don't really feel anything sparking inside of me when I am around him like I used to feel with other guys before my ex. Ever since I ended things with my first love, the idea of \"love\" is not the same to me anymore. I can't even crush on a guy really anymore. It used to be something I longed for and craved, and now it is something which I feel I am incapable of feeling and mostly a waste of my time. I keep hurting people because of it and I wish I could just open up myself and feel things again!\nTL;DR:"}

I'm motivated to keep losing, I know I could end up being pretty small, maybe even skinny if I kept going.\n\nHere's the thing, my boyfriend told me that if I keep getting smaller, he won't be attracted to me as much anymore. He said he loves me so much but he can't help it that he finds the chub to be sexy. He was fine with me losing weight to be healthy, but now that I am there, he wants me to stay where I am at. I mean, people like what they like, I get it. But I just don't know what I should do since society wants me to be skinny, and my boyfriend wants me to have a little fluff. I don't know what I want.

As we both don't really know what a good length of time for a break was, we decided that a week, added to the two we already have, should be suitable. We have decided that on Oct the 5th (aprox. 1 week from now) that we'd meet up for dinner, and discuss the future of us. I'm treating this break as a positive thing, because under so much stress, the both of us would have probably made a bad decision if we didn't take this breather. I don't really believe that a break means a break-up.\n\nThis is the first break I've ever been through, and it's going to be no direct contact with each other.

From my very first year till my last year, I worked with my best friends on a startup. Although our company wasn't successful, I learned a lot in the process. I graduated with my B.S. last year at age 20. When I went job hunting, I managed to leverage all my experience to land a good job. I am a Principal Engineer (PE) at a mid-size (500-2000 employees) company earning 190k/yr (160k + 30k/yr stock).\n\nFast forward to today. Since I've been here for a year, I feel as if my coworkers do not respect me the same way they do other PEs. I am the youngest PE in the company and sometimes it hurts me. I was initially brought on to design a new product for the company (a product similar to what my startup worked on). During meetings, when I suggest and strongly urge the team to take a certain direction/approach/technology, I am reprimanded for being too young. This is despite the fact that I have intimate knowledge about how to best architect the product and more experience in the field than all of my coworkers.\n\nDuring day-to-day conversations, my age and perceived inexperience is a frequent talking point. Frankly, if it didn't impact my ability to do my job, I wouldn't mind so much. But now, I'm getting sick of it. Does anyone have any suggestion for what to do?\nTL;DR:"}

We are all in our late 20s to early 30s.  My husband and I are 29 and 27, respectively.  Last night we were asked to host next week.  \n\nWe're excited but one thing occurred to me:  one female member of the group weighs around 350 pounds by my estimation.  My husband guesses closer to 375 or more..  \n\nOur dining set is antique.  It's in good shape, but the chairs cannot support 350 lbs.  I asked my husband (engineer) to check them out and he said the chair in best condition can probably hold up to around 305 lbs, the chair in the worst condition can probably hold up to around 265 lbs. \n\nHe also said we should avoid approaching even those limits - people sitting down \"heavily\" or shifting their weight could break the chair pretty easily.  And even if a chair can hold 305 pounds for a two minute test, something may happen over the course of a couple of hours.\n\nHow can we handle this as non-awkwardly as possible?\n\nSo far all we can think to do is buying a sturdy new chair and assigning seats with place cards so she ends up using it.  However it will probably be pretty obvious and may offend her.\n\nI should mention that she is pretty vocal about the fact that she does not feel weight is ever a problem.  She doesn't think that there's a big issue with weight vs. overall health, and she has made comments about her belief that everything should be made to accommodate overweight people instead of having special products to do it (e.g., all airplane seats should be very large instead of having a passenger use two seats).  So it might be easy to offend her...\n\nShe seems like someone who I could be great friends with and we get along very well.  I want to start our potential friendship off right and this feels like a road block.\nTL;DR:"}

My initial student loan for $10,500, received in January, was for Spring and Summer terms, and I budgeted accordingly (rent, tuition, books, etc.). I managed fine, but still had to take on some credit card debt.\n\nNow I just received another check for $10,500 for the Summer term, even though I've already paid Summer tuition. I don't have to take all of it, but considering that at present I don't have a job waiting for me after graduation, having that cash would be really useful.\n\nMy question to you all is if I should take that money even though I don't need it right now, but might need it later. I also have the option of only taking *some* of it.\n\nI guess my options are:\n\n* Take all of the money, use it to pay rent, fly to out-of-town interviews, etc.\n\n* Take part of it, e.g. just enough to pay off my current CC debt ($2500ish)\n\n* Take none of it, save myself some stress later in life and just really budget well to get by\n\nThanks in advance for any insight. If there's been a similar post, I wouldn't be hurt if you linked me to it.

For about 6 months now, I've known (not extremely well) this girl. It started about halfway through last year when during one of my classes I needed somewhere to sit. Because I didn't know where to sit, I just chose the last empty chair, which happened to be next to said girl and her friend. For the majority of the rest of that year I never engaged in a conversation with her save when we were doing a group project that really required to, and even then I couldn't bring myself to say anything other than what was necessary. After that school was over and I stayed home for most of the summer. At one point during the summer I went somewhere public where out of coincidence I saw her in the waiting room. She stood next to me (presumably because I was the only person she recognized) and didn't say anything. That would've been the perfect moment for me to be like \"oh hey you go here too?\" or just any sort of conversation, but as i tend to do when I see people in public I became nervous and just opted to not say anything. Now at the beginning of this school year I have her in another one of my classes and because our last name's start with the same letter we were seated right next to each other. And for the past 2 weeks I haven't said a word to her. So my problem is how would I begin to talk to her and have it not be weird considering I'd finally be trying to engage gee in conversation after a long period of near silence.

I know it can be beautiful, erotic, fun, whatever. I don't share the same beliefs as the majority of the people in the village I grew up in. He loves watching porn. It's not something that would get in between us, it's not something he needs. I enjoy watching it too, but the lifestyle I grew up with makes it difficult for me to just totally let go. I want to explore, but I can't help but feel a little hesitant because of the lifestyle I grew up with and it's getting to be pretty frustrating (frustrated with myself). I guess what I'm trying to say is what do I do? How do I overcome this? What are some steps I can take?\nTL;DR:"}

I'd like to say right now that I have no desire to make this into more than it really is, but I still feel that this is an issue. \n\nEver since I turned 13, my father has grown fond of touching my  waist, smacking my butt (not as a form of discipline) and  other types of  vaguely sexual touching. All of the above make me incredibly uncomfortable, as I am not a very physical person to begin with. Every time he touches me in this way I get the creepy-crawlers and an overall bad feeling in my gut. \n\nI have asked him multiple times and in multiple ways over the years to please stop doing this. When I ask politely, his answer is \"Too bad, I'm your father, suck it up\". If he deems my request rude he will either ignore me entirely or, in one case. slap me across the face in a public place. \n\nThis has been going on for 6 years. I am at a  total loss and completely hate this situation. If  this was happening to my daughter in my home I would  be horrified at the message this sends to her, but even attempting to go through my mother for help yields no result.\n\nI am not currently in a financial state to move out, though I would like to as soon as possible. \n\nI would once again like to clarify that, while this is a big issue for me, I don't want to make it sound like more than it is. I know many people have it way worse than me .\nTL;DR:"}

After I was offered, she said I should take it and she'd go with me.\n\nFast forward two months, we've been living here a month. She got a job working with me at my work (I work at a world famous speedway) but her job is a crappy minimum wage job to help with bills while she figures something out. We are in different departments so we don't see each other.\n\nHer family left for their California vacation today, something she always does with her family. She recently moved back to GA from Cali and always talks about wanting to move back there closer to her family. She's been pretty upset today.\n\nLately, every day, she's been complaining how much she hates it here and crying every night. She tells me to \"leave her the fuck alone\" and takes it out on me. I remind her that she was the one who told me I should take the job and she'd go with me, but she just tells me she is angry at herself for being so stupid.\n\nNow, she has no money and relies on me for most things. One time, she told me her plan was to save up enough money and then leave to go back to California and do long distance with me.\n\nI have no idea what to do here. I can't quit my two jobs and move back home. My parents would never look at me the same, and the job I have now is important for my career.

We've been getting into huge fights over me refusing to accept rent money from her for the house I bought. She's now saying that she is going to move back home with her parents if she doesn't find a job within the month because she doesn't want tp keep depleting her savings or to be a burden on me. I don't want her to leave and I've tried to explain to her that she is in no way a burden, but she won't have it. \n\nShe's been extremely depressed and I can tell her confidence is at an all time low. Shes quit spending any money on herself (no gym, no nails, hair, ect like she used to), she won't go out with our friends, and has sold her LV purse and some other things.

We dated for almost 4 years and she was manipulative, borderline uncaring, and cheated on me, which ended the relationship. I lost my virginity to her, which I regret. I have no idea why we stayed together. There was this deep attraction to each despite how terrible we were as a couple. I don't understand.\n\nFast forward to today. I've been dating my new girlfriend for about 7 months and I have never been happier. She's everything I could ever have hoped for. She's beautiful and funny and we completely click. I'm madly in love and unless something drastically changes for either of us, I could see us getting married somewhere down the road.\n\nSo my question is why the hell do I still think about my ex all the time. We broke up a long time ago and the relationship I'm in now is better in every way possible. I have absolutely no regrets breaking up with my ex. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I suppose I should also put in here that we tried staying in touch for a little while, but that we haven't spoken in several months.

Once we tried a threesome with another girl that ended not so well in this same kind of situation as I was not fully included. \n\nI guess what I am asking is how should I handle this situation? I don't really feel cheated on, but I do feel cheated. I want to chalk it up to a dumb mistake from the gray area of things we've discussed, but this is rough. When we talked on Skype, she was crying and very upset and embarrassed and not happy. She looked scared, and all she was saying was I don't want this to end, but I understand that you are unhappy with me. I told her that I am not giving up on her, which I still plan on doing.

He keeps to himself mostly, staying out of the living room when my roommate is at work, doesn't invite his friends over (thank god!), is quiet, isn't imposing, and doesn't leave much of a mess........My frustration comes from the fact that I work my ass off to stay in this apartment, the furniture that he sleeps on in the living room is mine, he sleeps at all hours of the day, shows no motivation to improve himself (no reading, little to no job hunting, no hobbies, not in school, can't cook for himself) and, after 2 months, this is starting to feel like a permanent situation.\n\nI don't want to sound like a dick, because he's not really doing anything wrong; it's mainly that he's doing nothing at all, staying here for free for so long, sleeps on my couch when I want to hang out in the living room, is present all of the time when I want my alone time (which was something I really appreciate about not living with the parents) and needs our apartment to remain unlocked 24/7 because he doesn't have a key and needs to be able to come and go at all hours of the day.\n\nReddit, do you think I'm being uptight?

We broke up in early August for college because we didn't think that we could handle the distance (she's in St. Louis and I'm in Clinton). She was my first everything and I loved this girl more than I thought I could love anything. Towards the end I wanted to try and stay together until Thanksgiving but she wasn't interested in doing that so we broke up. It was really hard for me until I went to college about a week later.\n\nAt first I had no issue: I didn't think of her and when we spoke it I didn't miss her at all. After a few days of video-chatting she had a breakdown and told me that she couldn't handle talking to me anymore because it still felt like we were dating so I went ahead and did no contact (more for her sake than mine). Soon after that I became interested in another girl and thought that I was ready to start a new relationship. We went on a few dates and then out of nowhere hit me with a crazy long email telling me that she wasn't ready to start dating again because of past guy issues. While this itself didn't hurt me too much, it brought out all of the pain and sadness I had from breaking up with my ex.\n\nThat was about two months ago and now I can't get my ex out of my mind. I keep getting random memories of fun things we did together popping up out of nowhere and I don't know how to make them stop. Going home a few weeks ago was almost unbearable and now that I'm back I don't really know what to do with myself. I'm dying to talk to her and see her but I don't think that would help either of us.

But every time I turn on my phone I check my messages to see if he replied. I asked him why he broke up with me the last time we spoke, and his answer made me feel like shit.\n\nHe said he was breaking up with me for my own good, to make me a stronger person, like him. He had an abusive family and has gone through a lot, but I was there every minute he needed it. I helped him get through so much. Including stopping him from killing himself a few times.\n\nAnd he did the same for me, I have depression, and aniexty, so we fixed each other, at least thats what I thought. we always tried to help each other out and be there when the other needed a shoulder to cry on, or yell or scream.\n\nAnyway, long story short, no matter how much I beg, I know he will never come back.

Help?\nPOST: The other day while playing a film on VCL player I saw the history of what had been watched recently on my boyfriend's computer, and out of curiosity I clicked on a porn video. What I found was BBW porn. I felt completely embarrassed and disgusted that my boyfriend was attracted to such large women. I myself am not skinny, I've always been a bit thick, but nowhere near the size of these women. It brought on all these insecurities of myself and my size and whether my boyfriend was only with me to fulfill his fantasy of larger women, whilst still being with someone of a socially acceptable size. I made the mistake of discussing it with him because now he is embarrassed and worried that I find him strange - I explained that the only reason why I was so upset was because of my own insecurities, and that I respect that everyone has their little secrets that turn them on (he also reassured me that he also watches a lot of 'normal' porn, and he just likes looking at larger women). \nSo, ever since this I've decided to turn my life around and lose weight, for my health, but also so I don't find myself associating myself with that interest of his, and so he can find me sexy as myself and not my size. My boyfriend who has always been against me dieting is now supporting me with my weight loss - as he says if it makes me happy it will make him happy, but he has also just confessed he has now gotten turned off by the larger women in his porn folder, mainly because of me discovering it, but I'm sure there's another reason. This has now made me even more insecure about my body. He hasn't initiated sex in a while and told me last night he's a little turned off by my 'self-hate', but I think it's because all of a sudden he is no longer attracted to me. \n\nSome advice would be much appreciated because I have no idea what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

He was working when I met him and seemed really responsible and put together but he decided to quit and take a semester to just focus on school which is fine but he blew all of his savings on beer and weed and whatever else he wanted to do. Since he quit that job he has been so immature. I don't mind him drinking but I don't drink so I usually leave him to do that with friends.

He's trying hard to find a job but I'm done supporting him and here's why. I went home yesterday to visit family and go to a few appointments and left him back there alone with my few pets. He bought himself alcohol with the little money he had left and got extremely drunk. While drunk he tried to clean my pet rats cage and couldn't put it back together right even with me helping over facetime, risking them getting hurt or lost in the house. I made him put them in a small cat crate with a towel for the night which he kept resisting but finally did.\n\nHe doesn't drink like this when I'm around it is only when I'm not there or when hes with friends so maybe once a month. Knowing this I don't think its a drinking problem but either just being immature or I don't know. I understand that people our age drink like that but shouldn't it still be responsible?

It's not a good plan, and they have no money, and aren't especially interested in finding a solution for their daughter.

We kept talking over the phone every day and would visit each other. We did long distance for about 8 months until she got a job in my city. We live together now in a tiny place because she doesn't make much and we had to live together for her to afford living here. \n\nWe went from long distance to living together in a tiny room but we've gotten along great. We've never had a fight in the 5 months she's been here. She would be the one except I find my self losing attraction to her. Its vain but I think I will regret being with her later in life. But on the other hand beauty doesn't last anyway. I'm really torn on this one because she's so great to me. \n\nI've never had a serious GF before her so I have no way to compare her to something else. She's incredibly nice and sweet to me. I can't imagine anyone loving me as much as she does but at 26 I feel like I'm too young to get married while she is ready.\nTL;DR:"}

We met at a camp in Boston (neither of us are from there). After the camp we just kind of kept talking and decided to try dating long distance. While I now realize that was stupid, to be fair she was really hot, at the time I didn't care. We talked on the phone all the time and we even visted each other a few times. I was her first , but she wasn't mine. We broke up after 6 months and never talked again. I think if we lived in the same place it could have been more, but it was doomed from the beggining. Fast forward to now, last time I was back home and getting some stuff together to take back to my apartment I cam across this box that had stuff from when we were dating. I was feeling nostalgic and looked her up and found her. I haven't talked to her since because I have no clue what to say to her. I don't want to date her again but I just want to talk to her. How do I approach that?\nTL;DR:"}

Thanks!\n\n>Alright so this guy that I find pretty attractive drove me home the other night after a party and then me, him and another girl that he's close friends with went to hang out in one of my roommate's rooms (the roommate was gone for the weekend and they're close friends so they were just going to stay in his room)\n\n>So the girl was sitting on the couch on her phone and guy was on the bed and it was pretty late so I figured my drunk ass should just go to bed in my room, but the two tell me to stay and so I do and the guy I'm attracted to tells me to lay down and he kinda pulls my arm and I fall right next to him. As this happened his arm wrapped around me so we were basically cuddling and I instinctively scooted closer and we kinda laid there like that for a good 30 seconds. After that he rolled onto his back (me still laying on one arm) and we started chatting and it was cool and I wasn't trying to hook up or anything, but I enjoyed hanging out like that and getting to know him a little more. So we kept talking until I referred to the girl that was still in the room, but then we both realized that she wasn't even there anymore and I was like what and he kinda freaked out and ran out the room saying something about seeing who was out there (As if anyone was awake at 4am). A while later the girl comes back and she lays in the bed on her phone so I just kinda get on my phone to wait for the guy but he's just like gone so I decide to just go to bed. \n\n>Maybe 10 minutes later I come back out to get some water and hear the guy back in the room with the door closed. So I kinda feel like he was trying to avoid me? I'm so confused.\nTL;DR:"}

Post college I seemed to really have it together. From 2001 to 2008, I worked in various HRIS administration and consulting roles and climbed the corporate ladder, saved aggressively for retirement and invested savings in stocks, bonds and real estate.  I held a few positions and also did some contracting work in the field of Human Resources doing system administration.\n\nIn 2008 I lost my job and then was unable to find work.  I looked for two years but somehow could not seem to find ANYTHING.  Perhaps I made job search mistakes but I couldn't find work of any kind in the U.S.  After two years I gave up.   I moved to Asia where I found a job teaching English.  I did this a while to make ends meet but then returned to the US to try give my career another shot.  I searched for several months but could not get an interview. No luck.\n\nI'm back in Asia now teaching English part time and again just making ends meet.  This isn't a sustainable life plan long term for me.  I'm only making enough money to just pay rent and keep myself fed so I'm really looking for some solutions how to rejoin society.\n\nIt seems my long term unemployment has made me untouchable for positions of my previous caliber.  And I've tried \"lower\" positions including waiting tables, fast food, retail, and it seems these companies weren't interested in hiring someone that's previous position was a  high paid consulting gig.   I really need to find some way to re-enter the game and am looking for suggestions.\n\nFor now I'm still in Asia so I'm looking to either find some ways to generate a bit of income on the side and fund my retirement or a reasonable plan to return to the US (or any country for that matter) and start over.  I'm pretty flexible but I just need some ideas or plan.   I still have savings left that are probably enough to survive one year without working but then I'll be near bankruptcy level.\nTL;DR:"}

Right now I'm signed up for a 10 miler at the end of September, which will be my longest official race up to this point.  I've been building a distance base (because I work on the principal of longer runs make you faster + I enjoy it, so why not) and I just ran 10 miles on Sunday, so I certainly can complete the race at this point.  I'm not in-it-to-win-it or anything, just wanting to enjoy myself.  I do have a few other days of shorter runs during the week with a running group, not part of an official race prep plan, just some intervals, strength work, etc.  At this point I'm not really wanting to put an actual plan on top of the interval work we're already doing in that group, so I've just been adding an extra easy or tempo day on top of their program in addition to just running longer LSD's than they have planned.  Essentially, just playing it based on how I feel that week.\n\nAll of that being said, is there any reason I shouldn't continue to extend my long runs?  My objective in the 10 mile race is to \"run comfortably\" instead of just finish.  \n\nAnother question for future reference, which is somewhat similar in nature:  Is there a disadvantage to following a training schedule for a longer race than you're doing if you're not super concerned about \"winning\" the race you're running?  (Example, Half Marathon plan for a 10K or Marathon for a Half).  Yes, I'm crazy, but you're all here in the loony bin with me.  :)\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Is it weird that I enjoyed high school more than I've enjoyed college so far?\nPOST: I'm not a freshman.\n\nSocially, I was far happier in high school than I've been in college so far. I was able to survive in HS because it was easy for me to socialize with people outside of my school, whereas in college it feels like I'm trapped with the same demographic of people I was to some extent trying to escape in HS.\n\nHS was also easier for me because there was a specific group of people I knew right from freshman year I knew I wanted to become friends with, and I did, gradually over time. Since they were all involved with stuff outside of school, like the local music scene, it was through them that I built a way bigger social circle of close friends.\n\nNow at college, I haven't had anything close to that experience. I haven't really found anyone I really relate to. And I've also slowly realized that the type of people I'm socially attracted to don't really go to college, at least not expensive private ones.\n\nPart of my problem is that I've had *close* friends for so long, that I've forgotten what it's like to not have them. And so for a lot of people I meet I think to myself, \"is this person best friend material?\" when I know it's just counter productive.\n\nI've also realized that in HS, I became dependent on the company of extreme extroverts, who socially advertise the type of people they, and I, are interested in, but I'm not used to attracting on my own, since I'm not really like the type of person I'm interested in being around. I like the company of people who are outwardly unabashedly weird, and really only care about making any situation fun, regardless f whether or not it's immature, both characteristics I really don't share. I enjoy the company of people who aren't like me who make life more interesting and force me out of my shell.\nTL;DR:"}

Like most people I know, I use my phone to wake up for work in the morning, until one fateful day when it finally decided to crap out completely. \nI'm a heavy sleeper and I don't wake up to much of anything... so I needed a replacement alarm for work the next day. It was too late to go buy an alarm clock and obviously getting another phone that quick was out of the question. Instead I remembered my iPod and promptly downloaded an alarm app on my ipod touch. Going through the settings I naturally chose the rooster alarm.\nI was skeptical about this idea as the iPod touch's speakers were pretty shitty and I didn't think it would wake me up. This is where I FU, genius me decides to hook my ipod up to my computer speakers, crank them full blast and move them closer to my pillow.. even though the speakers were right beside my bed already. I go to sleep thinking my idea is foolproof. \n6am and I wake up in level 10 panic mode to a rooster screaming in my ear. My brain that isn't awake yet tells me to start screaming for whatever reason. In my screaming panic I stand up and stick my hand into my ceiling fan spinning at top speed. I trip on the floor, fall on my coffee table and smack my head on my tv. Went to work that day with a messed up wrist and tinnitus.

After the first year, my girlfriend told me a few times that I needed to focus on her pleasure. Starting into the second year, she said this problem was getting big enough that she thought about leaving me. School was really stressful to me at this time. I was a semester away from graduating, my parents were moving out of the country in a few months. It's no excuse, but it just wouldn't come to mind to give her what she needed. I was an asshole to her. \n\nBut I've really changed this time, but I think it's too late. About a month ago we went on a weeklong break, initiated by her. She said after the break that it was just what she needed to give me a clean slate. However, we are still having issues.\n\nShe tells me I don't respect her, which I don't think I do. But she tells me that I've been showing signs of that from the beginning even before our sex problem. Her examples include me never going to a club once to see her dance because it's not my thing whereas she went to my concerts and practices when I was in a band even though she wasn't into metal. There was also an incident in our early stages where I told her I stop listening to her if she's telling me a story I've already heard before.\n\nI feel like an asshat in so many ways. I love this girl, and am scared to lose her. She is an amazing girl, she's beautiful, she cares for everyone she meets. She handles paying utilities and sometimes doesn't charge us roommates for it because we're struggling with money (she's from a well off family). \n\nI don't know how to fix this. I feel like I'm wrecking this girl, but I'm terrified to lose her. Even my family tells me to not lose her, they adore her, and I will probably find nobody better. My girlfriend tells me I don't respect her and that it's hard for her to trust me. How can we change that?\nTL;DR:"}

This is my first serious relationship, so I often have trouble communicating and articulating my true feelings in fear of damaging the relationship (even though I Know this is totally illogical). This past week I've noticed him texting a female friend pretty frequently. He's mentioned her to me before but I don't know much about their history. \n\nMy concern here isn't a fear that he will cheat on me physically (because I trust him and she isn't that good looking). It's the frequency of their correspondence that set me off. Neither of us are big on texting. We spend a lot of time together as it is so we usually only text to say the occasional 'good morning, love you, miss you etc', which was fine with me until I noticed this chick getting some swift responses- A luxury I don't often have for myself. I value communication above all else, but I want whatever conflict this may bring up to be constructive and bring us closer together. Again, this is my first serious relationship. I don't want to let my emotions get in the way and overreact, but I would feel worse if my failure to be more confrontational led him to lose his respect for me. my questions here are,\n\n-is this something I should confront him about immediately, or do I wait to see her name light up on his phone again?\n-How can I communicate and overcome my fear of confronting him about my needs?\nTL;DR:"}

She was hotter than two squirrels in a wool sock.  She had deep brown eyes and an amazing smile.  We were friends and I had been dating another girl through high school.  I never told her that I found her unbelievably attractive.  I saw her the summer after we graduated and we spent a few days running around together.  She shared with me that she had become pregnant and was on her own.  She was scared and unsure of the future.  I was bound for Texas and we both knew I couldn't stay.  \n\nAt one point, she reminded me that she \"couldn't get pregnant while she was still pregnant.\"  I really liked her, but I knew I didn't love her, and that she didn't love me.  As much as I wanted her, I didn't want to be just some guy she regretted.\n\nI never regretted not sleeping with her.  I lost touch with her until just recently.  We've both been happily married, to other people, and have children of our own.  She sent me a note telling me how much she appreciated me treating her with respect when it would have been easy not to.  I am proud of that.  It makes me proud of me. \n\nMy question isn't just for guys.  Perhaps some of the women on here can share a similar story.  Doesn't matter to me if you're gay either...you're welcome to respond.

Our parenting schedules aren't 100% the same so we have some nights where we have no kids, and some nights with just mine or just hers.  We don't live together so generally if no kids are present and one of our houses, we spend the night at the others.\n\nApparently it makes her 15 year old (and her ex) uncomfortable that we spend the night together when her kids are around.\n\nThis doesn't seem to affect the relationship with her other kids (she has 3, I have 2) and my kids since they weren't raised religious don't have any opinion on the matter.  In fact, I have a great relationship with her other 2 and my kids love her.\n\nI'm not sure what to do.  Because of our different backgrounds and beliefs I see it as likely that her oldest and I are never going to see eye-to-eye.  He's also the oldest and is likely to be more upset about either of his parents dating or \"moving on\".  That doesn't matter to me and I always provide him the same support and love I do for the others.\n\nI'm also of the opinion that it's ok for kids to be uncomfortable and it will either harden their beliefs or teach them to re-evaluate and be flexible with others that don't see the world as the same (you know, co-exist).  That said, I don't have the same religious background they do.  She hasn't made a decision about how to handle this and I'm not sure I can provide reasonable guidance here because I don't understand basing behavior on a 2,000 year old code of conduct let alone allowing a child's belief in that code alter our behavior.  \n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar?

If I learn that I didn't like it after all, he said he won't bother me with it anymore and respect my wishes. \nI'm a jealous woman..and have some insecurities that I have dealt with as a young child. I'm afraid that this will emotionally break me.\nHe doesn't want to be held back from living life and fulfilling certain wants and needs but wants to share this with me. He says he doesn't want it to be years later and still being restricted because it will make him feel miserable. It makes me feel guilty that I am technically holding him back from these needs..so I can try to keep an open and positive mindset and make the sacrifice in looking for a 3rd partner to get physical with but I already imagine this hurting me emotionally.\nSo I ask you redditors of the world...is there really some type of happy medium in this ? Am I overreacting or being selfish? I love this man so very much. And I know he loves me too..but I also realize how important it is for a human being to fulfill their fantasies. \nIs there any way to get over these insecurities and emotions?\nTL;DR:"}

Things are going great (I think!). I've met his dad a few times and he introduced me to his mom right before she died, even though we'd only been casually seeing for a few months. He also met my family in Tennessee once (we live in Montana). I stay at his place pretty much every night, we go away together on the weekend once a month or so and we are planning a big vacation for next February so it certainly seems like he is in it for the long haul.\n\nInitially, he was really guarded and had some intimacy issues. He was verbally unaffectionate and had trouble talking about anything serious. We had a few talks about it and he is a LOT better, he's much more open and now talks to me about things that affect the both of us and considers my opinion. \n\nI love him, but I'm not quite ready to say so yet. I'm sure he can tell, but I've said it way too soon in other relationships and I didn't mean it. I don't want to mess this one up. I would like to say it soon though, the feeling is exciting and overwhelming and it would be nice to get it off my chest!\n\nHe has this \"rule\" where he doesn't say \"I love you\" until he's been dating somebody for at least a year. He said this to me while we were just friends and talking about past relationships, and he's also said this while we were talking to friends who mentioned they had said \"I love you\" after a month.\n\nHis friends all say he's crazy about me and \"loves me even if he doesn't say it\". I certainly can tell that he is committed and likes me a lot. But I feel stuck having to wait for an entire year to let him know how I feel. I'm worried I'll scare him off if I say it any sooner.\nShould I wait or let him know when I'm ready?\nTL;DR:"}

Before I met her I always thought that I will never want or have kids. Well, I got in love, I started to love her, and I kind of warmed up with the though of founding a family together with her in the future. She for her part always knew that she wanted kids, ideally when she's around 25 years old. And now that the relationsship has lasted some time, I think my mind is clearing up and I am pretty sure again, that I just don't want kids. Ever.\n\nThe point is, that I have a very time consuming job, that is my absolute passion - I am a professional skydiver and I think this is very big part of my personality. During summer I work at least 6 days a week (usually 7) from 8 AM to at least 8 PM as long as the weather is not bad. During winter times are reduced a lot, but I still work more than 40 hours per week. My GF doesn't really see this as a problem currently as she also needs a lot of time for herself and I am spending every free minute I have with her - we are both happy with the amount of time we spend together (to be absolutely clear). But we both don't really see my work schedule uniteable with having kids. And as it seems she is taking it for granted that I will stop skydiving and look for a different job in order to found a family together with her. A job that I don't want and that will make me unhappy. I don't know, but ever giving up such a huge part of my life is not really what I intend - at least I cannot imagine right now even if a cannot guarantee that this will not change in the future.\n\nHas anybody ever been in a similar situation?\nTL;DR:"}

Lately we're having some pretty rough times. Both of us got a pretty packed schedules but despite all of that Im always trying to find some time for us and make it work. And its always the same pattern, at first she is happy and agrees. Then its I have a lot of work to do at home so I'll let you know ( which by now I learned it is a silent no type of response) and the final stage is I cant because xxx/yyy we need to find some time for us. And this pattern is going for couple weeks now to the point Im starting to feel hurt and rejected. When I brought up the issue she brushed it off saying that its just the time of the year, which does seem lika a reasonable excuse. \n\nAnyways now we're into a new phase that is her ignoring all of my texts for the past three weeks. We were never big on texting anyways mostly exchanging basic info on hows our day going, what plans do we have etc. ok so I tried calling/facetiming just to see whats up. No response or at best a text containing \"ok\" its really confusing.\n\nSince I dont really want to blame her for that Im just thinking that maybe im just to pushy and she has some personal and work issues going out right now. But on the other hand I dont want to feel like hanging and just waiting untill her mood is back to normal.\nat this stage I just dont know what to do and its getting really depressing.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25 M] with my EX [25 F] of 5 months, \"No Contact Rule\" not an option. How can I move on?\nPOST: Last August I started graduate school, and soon thereafter started dating a girl I met in my program. I knew it was risky to date someone I work in close proximity with, but I decided I just needed to take the chance, and she seemed worth it. We dated for the next few months and, at least I thought, we were doing great and we were very happy together. Out of nowhere, shortly before Winter Break, she broke up with me, citing wanting to focus more on school and an ex she's still getting over (although I presume having lost attraction to me is the main issue). She said she wants to go back to us being friends, and I said I didn't know if that would be possible. I avoided her as much as I could until the break, and then I returned home for some much needed R&R.\n\nBut now that I'm back at school starting my Spring semester, I am faced with seeing her regularly (in classes and labs) and we have many mutual friends. I've always been a firm believer in the \"No Contact Rule\" as very important to moving past a breakup, but complete no contact is not an option in my current situation. I want to move on from this girl that broke my heart. Any advice for moving on with my life?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Movies referencing other movies, and the contradictions therein\nPOST: Whenever a film or TV show references another film or TV show, does anyone else try and see if that reference was possible without causing a contradiction or breaking the fourth wall?\n\nFor example, say TV Show X references Movie Y. Because they did this, everything related to Movie Y must exist in the world of Show X. Here is something that might cause a contradiction: You went to the IMDB page of Movie Y, saw that Actor A in that movie co-starred with Actor B in another movie, and saw that Actor B costarred in another movie with Actor C, and saw that Actor C was in a film with Actor D. But Actor D is someone playing a character in Show X. Hence, by referencing Movie Y, Show X has created a contradiction where, not only does a character exist in this world, but also his actor.\n\nAnother example could be the following: Movie A references Movie B, who references Movie C, so on and so on. We follow the chain until we get to a movie that contradicts Movie A. For example, say in Movie A donuts don't exist. Yet, in Movie D, someone eats a donut. A contradiction has occurred.\nTL;DR:"}

My friend got breathalized and he was above the legal limit still. Though he was not intoxicated in anyway. So the cop arrested him, but didn't read him his miranda rights.

Always agreed on our timeline to get engaged around now and to get married next year. \n\nFor the past year or so, we have been looking at possible wedding venues. He wants a destination wedding (probably Europe), and I would prefer it to be in our home country (we are both originally from North America, different hometowns, but are currently living and working in Asia). I'm not too hung up on venue because we both have family and friends all over the map so it would require some of them to travel regardless. Just thought that home country would make things easier.\n\nSince he has a small family and fewer friends, I'd always known and agreed that it would be a small wedding. But I didn't know that our definitions of \"small\" were so different. \n\nHe only has 2 family members who will attend, plus a handful of friends, and he doesn't want the guest list to look \"unbalanced\" (too many guests are my family/friends instead of his). So he wants both of us to only invite 10 people each. My definition of small wedding is more on the lines of 50 guests.\n\nI have a very big family (if it were up to my mom, she would probably invite 80-100 extended family members). But in terms of close family, there would be 9 that I would absolutely have to invite, which would leave me with one spot for a friend.\n\nEven if he were willing to budge and up the number to 15, I would still have a ton of friends who would be very upset if they did not get invites.\n\nI know that wedding planning is generally stressful on engaged couples, and really don't want this to put unnecessary stress on us right from the get-go. On the other hand, I really don't want to disappoint my family and friends.\n\nAlso this is not a budget issue - we have saved at least $35k USD for the wedding.\nTL;DR:"}

My boss is at the facility from at least 8am until 9pm every day of the week, including weekends and paid holidays. She hasn't taken a day off since last memorial day. She takes on any odd job or thing to do around the office and if anyone tries to offer to do the task instead she gets defensive. There are dozens of things integral to our job that no one knows how to do because she takes it over.  I work in a lab and I like to do things a certain way to keep myself organized and on task. Periodically she will take a break from the work she is doing to do my job. She says she likes doing it because it is relaxing. Not only do I find it offensive that something I work very hard on means nothing to her, it also disrupts the organizational scheme I had in place. If I request she stop and explain why, she becomes angry with me. She will also come into the lab while I am working and micromanage. She will hover over me and criticize everything I do despite the fact that we have never had contaminated results.  I have spoken to her boss about it but since she does the work of five people and only reports 40 hours a week, we can under quote our competition and get more revenue for the office. He will do anything to make her happy and cannot perform some of his basic job duties without her so she will never be fired or reprimanded.

He had been running and being chased by other dogs for about 12 minutes. After getting some water and resting, we decided to walk with him around the park off leash, something we've done plenty of other times.

I looked in her phone at her text messages. In the texts, I see that she was the one that really wanted to initiate being friends with him. She would also ask if she could call him and talk to him. She has said things like \"you'll definitely be hearing from me a lot\". And the worst part I think was the fact that she even invited him to come stay in our apartment.\n\nI really want to call her out on it, but idk what or how to say anything. We are already moved in and living in the same room. If you guys have any advice, let me know what you think.\nTL;DR:"}

She was acting kinda strange, so I asked her if she was feeling okay. She said she was fine. \n\nAfter we got home she said we needed to talk. Okay, red flags. I thought I'd done something wrong, but she just wanted to tell me that back in the first few months we were dating, she kissed her best friend. Or was kissed by her best friend. She says she didn't start it and she pulled away a little bit afterwards because she was surprised.\n\nFirst I'm pissed because she waited this long to tell me. Then I'm pissed because I knew that guy was a dick and they still hang out. Now I'm just kinda stumped. I love this girl, and a kiss isn't a big deal, but the time it took her to tell me is and I probably sound like a sucker but I believe it stopped at a kiss. She says that she's been feeling really guilty about it since we got serious, but didn't know when to bring it up. She's taken off tonight to stay with her other best friend who's a girl to let me think. Tomorrow she wants to know if it's something we can pull through. \n\nI talked to my brother about it, and he thinks I'd be throwing away an awesome relationship over a kiss if I broke it off.

A week ago, he told me that he loves me and asked me to be his girlfriend. I told him that while I do love him, I need to think about getting into a relationship with him simply because we haven't worked in the past - he has a history of shutting down and becoming this thick wall for no reason (at least, he never explains the reason) and I also want to give him room so that he can find someone who may be better. We would be in a long distance relationship and it makes me a little insecure.\n\nWhile he still tells me that he loves me, he's now starting to ignore me and is shutting me out, which is majorly confusing. I love having him as my friend, but my gut tells me he's losing interest. Should I end the friendship? His cold behavior just make me feel like there's something wrong with me. \n\nThere's also this: He is an Iraq war veteran. He has told me about his PTSD in detail - about his nightmares, his painful flashbacks and guilt... among other things. I know that PTSD isolates its sufferers... but he won't communicate with me, and I'm unsure if he just wants to move on or if I should stick by him and be there while he tries to resolve his problems. \n\nIf anyone has any good resources on PTSD and how loved ones can come to understand and communicate with their partners - I would greatly appreciate that. \n\n* I first posted this in dating advice, but deleted it since this forum seems more appropriate.

We were both extremely close and knew each other well, had a very active sex life.\n\nWhen we were about to go to college (her in PA, myself in NC) she thought it best to break off our relationship while still remaining friends of sorts as she didn't think long distance would work.

She immediately found another partner, however that relationship didn't last long. I had what can only be described as revenge sex with a mutual friend, which she knows about.\n\nOver this summer we reconnected once while she was in town and had sex. She has been gone ever since at camp where she hooked up with two different guys and is now on her way back to college. I have not had any sexual contact with anyone other than my ex during the summer.\n\nShe wants to keep in touch and see each other during breaks in the school year, but I'm not sure I should hold on to the past anymore because I feel like it negatively affects my social and emotional health at college.

Each day of the trial basically takes up most of the day; you get to court at 9:30am, proceedings begin at about 10am, breaking at 1pm for an hour for lunch, and then going until about 4pm. \n\nThe trial began on Monday with the opening summary, where the prosecution essentially present the series of events and introduce the case to the jury. This was all pretty interesting to me as I had no prior knowledge of the case, and some witnesses were also brought in too. I paid attention throughout all of it. \n\nThat night, it was a friend's birthday so she was having a party. I didn't get home until about 1am, only got about 7 hours sleep, so I turned up at court at 9:30 on the Tuesday morning hungover and shattered. That Tuesday was basically a retread of the day before, just in more detail. \n\nI was sitting in the public gallery which was a collection of folded seats a bit like you find in the cinema, adjacent to the dock where the defendant was. \n\nAt some point after lunch, I began to fall asleep. I wasn't up against any wall, I didn't have anything to lean on, and I was sitting on the corner of the gallery with the jury about a meter away from me. I was sitting on the lower row of chairs, with steps right next to me leading up to the jury. \n\nYou can probably guess what happened next. I fall asleep, and initially nobody notices - that is, until I lean over too far, and fall off my chair hitting my head right on the edge of the steps leading up to the jury, giving myself a deep cut and concussion. \n\nAll the proceedings were interrupted as I was led out of the courtroom, befuddled and still half asleep trying to work out what the hell had just happened. The judge was actually really nice about it and met me afterwards to check if I was okay.\n\n___________________________________\nTL;DR:"}

I've been wanting to call him/text him so bad, but I figure he needs space.\n\nOne of the things that makes me mad is that he used to smoke pot regularly when he was 19.

He smokes, he does pot, he is violent, he does nothing but play his video games and he always puts me down.. I never realized how much he put me down until I began to fall out of love with him. He doesn't like any career choices I make. (i.e. I had planned all my senior year studies so that I could get into psychology at UNI and study to be a psychologist, so I can become a student counsellor.

She'll assign blame to others or assume things in the most negative way possible. It's only happened twice, once for about a week roughly 2 months into dating her and just recently. So roughly a 7 month gap between these 'outburts'? She normally doesn't act angry or places blame on others, which is what has me worried. She acts normally in front of other people, and gets this way when it's just us two. I'm not sure if she's relying on me for something I'm not picking up on or if this is something inside her that's causing trouble.\n\nIs this my fault for being clingy/oversensitive about this? Or am I just not being supportive in the right way?\n\nWhat I suppose I want to say, is how should I approach this? I've tried asking her to calm down and that just makes her more upset.

I just need some perspective on what I should do.\n\nMy friend [18/f] had dated my other friend [18/m] whom we are no longer friends with. For a while, it seemed corrupt for me to have feelings for her while she was dating my friend. So, I put it aside. Now they have broken up (a while ago) and I feel as if I should say something, but I value our friendship and it would be terrible to make things awkward if I tried anything.\n\nSome reasons I think she likes me back:\n\n * When she was in a relationship with my friend (referenced earlier) and we would go to dinner, she would rub her feet on my legs and tap my feet with hers. She still does this.\n\n * Whenever we're walking, she bumps into me a lot.\n\n * Whenever we're standing around and she walks by me, she slowly grazes her arm against my back or slides her chest along my arm for a moment.\n\n * When I have conversations with her, she has a hard time looking me in the eye. When she gives me direct eye contact, she doesn't turn away and the stare becomes very intimate.\n\n * Whenever I offer to go somewhere, she almost always never says no unless she's working (but this is just speculation, it's not really plausible).\n\nIf I think pursuing a relationship is a good idea, how should I start it? I've tried telling girls how I feel in the past and it always ends up with me being rejected or friendzoned. I absolutely have no idea what I'm doing what it comes to pursuing a relationship.\n\nThanks for any and all advice.\nTL;DR:"}

Anyways, so my sister is usually a pretty tame person, but when she gets around my cousin, the two of them like to start some pretty annoying stuff. (Bad influence).\nSo every night I slept over there, my cousin liked to fuck with me. Not only that, but she got my sister in on it too. Every morning, at the crack of dawn, she and my cousin would burst into my room while I'm still sleeping to jostle me awake roughly and run away laughing. And this went on over and over. They'd also do other things, like blow whistles in my ear while I was sleeping, or throw these loud toys that went off and blared noise while slamming the door shut laughing their asses off. Pretty effective way to ruin my day.\n\nSince locking the door proved useless, *(It was one of those push in and turn handles, it just needed a long skinny stick or something to push it back open from the outside)*, I had enough of their shit. I love my sleep and I love it even more in the morning on MY spring break.\nPretty petty, but I got back on my sister. She had this one book series she loved. Warrior cats or some shit like that. Oh, and those Percy Jackson watchamacallit novels. So every so often, very neatly, I would take my exacto knife from Art and carefully cut out pages from the books. Not too many, but a few. No trace of cutting was visibly to be seen. I also loved taking one of the books and cutting out nothing but the last page so when she got to it, it would abruptly end. had a smile the next day when I heard my sister whining and saying Barnes&Noble had sold her a faulty books or something along that line.\nTL;DR:"}

Her on the other hand has problems and often feels very sad when we are apart and it takes it toll on me as it is hard to keep the mood up when she is kind of 'heartbroken' all the time because we are apart. \n\nI really dont know how to make her feel better, we live around 120 km from each other (2 hours by train).\n\nI just want her to feel better because it is hard to hold the mood for both of us. We will be able to move in together in around a year.\n\nI moved away from out hometown to study last summer and we got back together(we broke up because i would have to move) after around 3 months of me being away because we missed each other.\n\nPlease ask questions if you need more insight, first time posting here.\nAnd thanks for you time!\nTL;DR:"}

She and I have talked on and off for a while, but I was dating another girl at the time. Well, she and I broke up a couple months ago, and the girl from my building and I had a mutual friend who started inviting her to hang out with us. Since then we've been talking quite a bit, and we've started hanging out more, including by ourselves. \n\nSo, this is where it gets complicated. She's never really made it public or definitive that she was dating another guy from our building, but I knew they had hooked up a few times. However they had a falling out a while ago and no longer talk. But she was hanging out with me and talking to me more before they did. Now, while she doesn't see him any more, she has more guy friends in our building than I do in our whole area it seems, and while we do spend time together, she spends a lot of time with them as well. \n\nSo, the here and now is, we do flirt a little bit here and there. As the title says, it's been a long time since I played the early stages of the dating game, and I'm not sure where it's going, or what moves to make. We're both smokers and she invites me out for smokes with her here and there, and it's usually just us and we talk and laugh. But I'm not sure if it's just being friendly or if I could take this somewhere.\nTL;DR:"}

I have no romantic history and have little sexual experience (2 flings). This is a result of being very shy as I have only recently broken out as a person.\n\nA fellow student [19f] and I have been good friends for a majority of first year together have many mutual friends. She had recently broken her boyfriend and only a few days later we exchanged feelings. I didn't expect to feel as much as I did and took my entire guard down which made her uncomfortable and she eventually renounced her feelings :(.\n\nAfter which we have had cycles of emotional feelings which go up and down and literally feel like they change day to day. She is going through her rebound phase and jealousy has started to get to me. I see her often and I get butterflies, but I know a stable relationship just ins't possible right now.\n\nThis girl is someone that really turns me one because of her beauty, intelligence and above all her personality. I want to get intimate with her, but I feel like I will just get me even more hurt and am very hesitant to actually ask her out (because of the unstable feelings).\n\nAny advice for a confused redditor like me? I care about her, but my feelings are taking a toll on my emotions. I've never felt so human, but I fear that my relationship with her has been damaged. I tried speaking to her about this and didn't really get an answer, from what I understand she wants me to ignore the feelings like I did before.\nTL;DR:"}

They broke up about a year ago. He broke up with her due to suspected cheating, and had always spoken with mild disdain about her to me. He would summarize their relationship as that he was always the one putting in the effort, she was vindictive, and a mean drunk.\n\nWithin the last couple months though, they've been texting casually. He says they only text about general things and life updates, and send each other memes or funny pictures. \n\nAlthough with some weird behavior - when he went to show me something she sent him, he tried to pull it up but then said he had actually deleted their convo, and that he deletes their conversation daily because he is afraid it will make me jealous if I see it. He has also deleted her contact, but has her number memorized. I think this is because I got jealous she was in his iPhone recent contacts, so he deleted her number so it just wouldn't show up there.\n\nHe also pulled up Facebook to show me a family member, and I noticed she was the most recent profile he had searched for, and i had also noticed this about a week ago when he was showing me someone else. They are not Facebook friends.\n\nHe doesn't have a ton of suspicious behavior aside from deleting the texts - he is not protective of his phone at all, doesn't get any late night texts or a lot of texts at all. He says he likes being cordial/friendly with the ex. How do I get over the fear that he still has feelings for her, or find out if this is true?\n\nI'm not sure how to talk to him about my fears, when we talk about it he gets frustrated with my jealousy and assures me he is over her. I'm just worried he will keep her on a pedestal, or that he misses being with her.\nTL;DR:"}

It's only been four months, but we are in love with each other and say it everyday. It all feels so perfect. She goes to a small liberal arts school where she is a junior, and I live in a big-city and am a year away from finishing school here.\n\nWe met over winter break, and to say things have been going swimmingly is an understatement. Even though we are long-distance, we text all day and do the skype thing every night. She is five hours away, and we have still managed to see each other five times in 2016 -- with another visit (me to her) looming two weeks from now. I have never connected with someone like this emotionally, and am just absolutely floored by everything she has and does. Beauty, ambition, humor, compassion, creativity. She's a rockstar. And she is equally supportive and interested in my life as well. It's awesome. I always ask if I am impeding on her college life, and she says she had three years to find a quality guy on campus and yet it was the boy from home that won her heart.\n\nShe came in for Easter this weekend, and we met each others parents which went exceptionally well. We had a wonderful night out in the city last night which added even more a spark to our relationship.\n\nThere's no problems to report, just a worry about first loves not working out and never being able to close this distance. It's too soon to even bring that up, but maybe in another four months we can have a talk about being together when school is finished. We both have big goals for the future, and certainly don't want to disrupt any of that. But with each passing day, week, and month, I see our futures becoming more aligned together and it's a beautiful thing to watch unfold. I just hope it works out.\nTL;DR:"}

Long story short, I cheated on him this semester (our final semester) with a good friend here and we broke up. The good friend and I continued hooking up and we're effectively in a relationship now. The thing is, we won't put a label on it or define it because we're both scared of getting too attached when it will end in a few months after we graduate (he's from the UK, I'm from the US). I'm planning on applying to jobs and stuff in Europe and potentially the UK but there are no guarantees and we'll most likely be apart. We keep bringing it up but dancing around the subject and never come to any conclusions. I know that I probably shouldn't have jumped into something so quickly, which is why it's taken so long to define, but the fact of the matter is that we're effectively exclusive and spend a lot of our time together so not defining it at this point is just stupid and causes a lot of fighting/confusion.\n\nOn another note, he can be a huge dick sometimes. He never offers to pay for things and I've even paid for a few things myself (under his expectation that I would, which I find ridiculous). I feel like that's just common courtesy to OFFER. He also makes a lot of snide comments and when I get annoyed he says he's joking but sometimes I'm just like \"dude, relax, that was too far.\" I get that it's his personality but he can be pretty offensive at times. \n\nI get that it's possible I am comparing him too much to my ex and trying to recreate a four year relationship that was pretty awesome with a good friend that won't have the same amount of time to build up. I just don't know how to separate out my feelings and come to terms with what I want and how to go about this. Any thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

Advice?\nPOST: I'll try to keep this short. As the title says, I live with a few people, two of which are a married couple that have a dog that's around a year old. I love dogs, but I haven't had one since I was a kid, so I don't know much about pet care/how much time is reasonable to be in a crate. But I feel like \"Rover\" is in his for an excessive amount of time\n\nFor example, today was a holiday so everyone was off work and at home. I know Rover was out for some time this morning, not sure how much, but I know for sure from noon on he was locked up for all but an ~hour of the rest of the day. Why? I'm not sure, since his owners were both home. Had I been here and they not I would have let him out, but since his owners were here I didn't feel like I was able to do that without stepping on their toes.\n\nOn normal days he's locked up for ~9 or so hours while they are at work/not home, ~9 while they are getting ready for bed/sleeping, and also ~1 to 2 hours when they just don't want to deal with him for whatever reason. So that leaves ~4 to 5 hours a day that Rover is not locked up. Again, I don't know much about owning a dog, but this seems cruel to me.\n\nI'm not really sure what to do in this situation. I feel bad for Rover being caged so much. When I'm here and his owners aren't I let him out and play with him, but when they're here I don't feel like I can do that since he isn't my animal. Am I making this into an issue that doesn't exist? Does this constitute abuse or neglect and should bring it to the attention of someone? If so who? Should I just try talking to them about letting him out more often/for longer? Thoughts and opinions would be appreciated, thanks in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

On Monday he was being kind of distant and instead of giving him space like a sane person I completely blew up his phone. Yes I realize that was completely crazy, I'm extremely ashamed at my behavior and then I started apologizing profusely. He ignored me all day Monday, yesterday he told me to \"leave him alone\" and I haven't heard from him since. \n\nThe texts came from a place of deep insecurity as a result of other guys from my past and I don't want to go into detail about that or what the texts said.

We formed a soulful union almost immediately and found a completely wholesome and spiritual love with each other. At the time we started seeing each other we established the usual \"This can't really be a serious thing\" because she was getting ready to graduate college and I had already graduated and the future was uncertain. Obviously you can't always hold true to those kinds of rules when you fall in love with someone. It's not something that can be helped. I loved and still love her more than I've loved anyone else. The months wound down to her imminent departure as she got into grad school in San Francisco.

We discussed options; me trying to move with her to San Francisco, trying an open relationship, trying a long distance relationship etc. \n\nFinally the day came for her to leave and now she's in San Francisco. We still talk every day, but it's so incredibly difficult as nothing is really established.

The girl that I slightly knew from high school, its like half the time she is like,\" Oh hi! How was your day? That is awesome! :D\" to other times where she just doesn't even look at me... I know that most of this is probably incoherent but I just needed to try to say it to someone in the hopes that someone else understands what I am trying to say. Would I come off as desperate if I try to hang out more often, show up at their work and say hi, invite to parties and such, etc...?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [f/22] found the One [m/23], but I think I want to date more\u2026\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for several years. We love each other more than anything, and I know for a fact that he's the one I'm meant to be with. However, lately I've been thinking about dating more before settling down. It can be argued that he's the first real relationship I've had (in other words, I'm excluding any middle/high school \"things\" I've had). This isn't a matter of keeping my options open, so please don't misunderstand. It's also not a matter of being unsure about him, because I know we're soulmates. But the thing is, I'm still young and I haven't really experienced the fun of flirting and chasing guys around as an adult if you know what I mean. It's not even that I want to sleep with other guys or anything like that (I personally can't give myself to someone unless we're 100% serious, and I've obviously already found that). I honestly, truly just want to experience dating more. \n\nI wouldn't do any of this right now, but I feel like eventually I'd need to break things off for a while to experience these things. Then when I'm ready to settle down forever, I'd go back to him. I wouldn't be putting him on the shelf. He'd be able to date or even sleep with whoever he wanted if he so desired. Then when he was ready, he could come back to me. \n\nHowever, I feel bad about telling my boyfriend this. He's dated much more than I have and finally found what he's looking for in me, and I feel like dropping this on him would be cruel. And I don't want it to seem like I'm using him or making him my backup plan, because it's not like that at all. Has anyone else had this experience? Am I wrong to feel this way? Am I a horrible person for wanting this? If not, how do I break something like this to him? If you tell me I suck for thinking this, I'll put it out of my mind forever.\nTL;DR:"}

I work in a mid-sized company currently, and I'm shouldering 20k of irresponsible CC Debt (which is in the area of 95% utilization and seriously hurting my credit score). Things ran away from me and I'm aware that I'm the cause and have set up a budget and a schedule to pay this debt off (looking at Jan 2015 for current full pay off).\n\nI have an income of about 3.2k a month, and disposable of around 1.7 after cutting expenses pretty close. I have an incoming bonus of approx 3k after taxes and a small emergency fund of 2k.\n\nI'm comfortable with my plan to pay off the debt. But what I wanted was advice regarding switching jobs. I have some networking connections that I can speak to and try and break into an industry I'm more comfortable in regarding both the area of focus and the potential for growth. The industry I'm looking at is Financial Services and I'd be meeting with various people in top tier FS companies and Banks.\n\nI'm scared to start searching now and connecting with people now because if I'm fortunate enough to get in the room with an interviewer and succeed that they might pull my credit report and see:\na) my irresponsibility \nb) my credit score \nc) my utilization \n\nI don't know if I'm being paranoid by wanting to wait, but I'm also concerned if I wait too long I'll be at this current job too long to get out. I'm also pretty unhappy here with almost everything, the work, the people, the level of compensation\n\nMy current job is at a Consulting firm to Financial Services but I don't do anything on that side of the house.\n\nShould I be less concerned about my credit score and take the leap before it gets too late? One of my possible options is to start meeting with people April after I get my bonus and direct that totally towards CC debt so my utilization goes down to about: 70%.\n\n(I'm about 1.5 years in at this company, I'm concerned if I've been here for 2+years then it will be harder to justify the drastic change).\n\nThanks for the advice, just writing this out and asking for advice from other people is helping.\nTL;DR:"}

On his days off he just wants to stay around the house and sit on his computer, I like spending time on reddit too, but it sucks that that's our only time together. It almost feels like I am single, except my single friends can still meet people, I feel like I'm doomed to be alone forever because I do have someone I care about, I just never get to see him.\n\nYou might ask why I wouldn't have left sooner, but the thing is, hes a really good guy, who I care about a lot.

A wife who depends on me, whom I love dearly, and a family that I only recently made peace with. The problem is, I can't go to bed at night without thinking about the empty dark after life.

I met him at the beginning of summer break, so I didn't notice how neurotic he was about success until a year ago. Since then, he's been up and down and up and down and.. well, you get the idea. I feel bad about describing him this way, but I have no other words. To give you an idea of what he's like, I'll tell you about today. He's just returned back to school for his last semester. Naturally, he's surrounded by people who are buzzing about the classes they've signed up for and the jobs they've lined up after graduation. Normal, right?\n\nNonono, not for him. This chatter completely sets him off. He's been freaking out most of the afternoon because he's heard about his peers' success. If someone says they have a job, he freaks out because he doesn't have one lined up yet. It's not a \"Oh, that's great they found something, I hope I find something\" reaction that I'd have... it's a \"OH MY GOD, they have a job because they work so hard, and they do so well, and I don't have a job, and I don't work hard, and I am lazy\" etc. I'm having a hard time understanding how someone talking about their success can snowball into my BF completely destroying his character (calls himself lazy, a procrastinator, not smart enough). \n\nIt really doesn't even take much for this to happen. Just before finals, my BF would freak like this if he noticed someone was studying harder than him in the library. He'd feel so guilty if he had to take any breaks and sometimes wouldn't let himself have a break from studying to sleep. By the end of finals, he was so sleep deprived he was legitimately *hallucinating*!!\n\nSo r/relationships, how do I reconcile our different approaches to other peoples' success?

While doing this, a lot of protein will be needed to help repair the muscles being \"worked out\".\n\nThe other argument is that at a calorie deficit, one's body will simply increase its size or decrease its size until there is a balance between the calories being burned and the amount being taken in.  This means muscles that may require more calories than their share of calories at the calorie deficit will decrease in size/atrophy while muscles that are in surplus calories in their share of calories at the calorie deficit will become larger.\n\nIf the second argument is true, could it be possible that any muscle gains be at the cost of other muscles in your body that are not being used?\nTL;DR:"}

It kind of sucked real hard as I was out of the house from 6am-11pm every night without a break, but i've managed to get by without any loans so far so that was nice.  After this summer semester I will officially have run out of classes I can take at the local community college which puts me into a predicament. I got accepted to the university nearest to me, (about 1.25 hrs drive) but due to the fact that I've been working for the past few years I'm not even being offered enough in loans to cover the tuition (about $10k per year). After speaking with the financial aid department, they said i could file an appeal due to a change in situation if i lost my job, but otherwise they couldn't do anything. My plan was to be able to stop working (at least more than part time/odd jobs with little commitment), move to the city of the school, and live off loans/odd jobs. I tried applying for private loans, but having a 590 credit score and no cosigner means thats a no go. \n\nI've reached out for as many scholarships as i could find, and so far I have three coming to me because of grades, and being in a less popular STEM major. My problem is I have no idea how much these will total up to. Currently, I can say confidently that I will have about $12,000 between loans and scholarships, and I have about $7,000 in the bank, and about $3,000 in my 401k and $2,000 in my IRA. living modestly, I figure it will cost me about $23,000 anually (including tuition) to get by. I feel as if I'm coming up pretty short, and while I can probably afford the first year, my money will dry up quickly. Is it even worth pulling out of my retirement accounts early?  I'm kinda running out of ideas here and I'd really rather not commute that far and work that much while i'm in school. Does anybody know any other options?\nTL;DR:"}

We are currently 8 hours apart as she got an almost full ride scholarship to the school she is at. We met over last summer and decided to try the long distance deal because she's amazing and great and I love her and our relationship has been really going well these last 8 months.

At the start of our relationship I told her that was the plan and she thought it was cool. Lately she has been talking more about the future and our future together and what we're going to do when I graduate while she's still in school. She has been talking to her academic advisers about options for schools in my home state to transfer to and her adviser suggested instead of leaving her school, that I could move to a city closer to her until she graduates to keep things going. I shot that idea down almost immediately and I could tell she was kind of upset by it but understood why as well.\n\nIs it unreasonable of me to not want to give up the plans I've had since starting college for a relationship that has only been going on less than a year. We love each other and I can absolutely see a future with her and would be willing to wait a little while but 4-5 years for just her undergrad not to mention any additional schooling beyond that. If I do go back home I don't know what that means for our relationship to be honest and I know she's worried about that, as am I but I guess to a lesser extent.\nTL;DR:"}

I am now trying to get back into dating.  One of the hardest things for me is to set the tone of the date that I like the girl that I'm with.  Most girls I've been on dates with, said that I'm very easy to talk to but they just don't see a romantic connection with me. To me this means that the conversations aren't necessarily boring but I'm not escalating into a sexual relationship with the person and thus landing into the friend zone.\n\nOn most of my first dates, I am too safe and just like to get to know the person I'm on a date with.  Is this the wrong approach?  One question is how soon into the actual date should I be flirting or showing interest in the girl?  I don't want to seem too eager or too forward right away.  Is it too late to start flirting on a 2nd date and have I missed the opportunity with her already?  \n\nOne particular example,  I took a girl out to dinner.  We seemed to hit it off at least with some common interests.  Going to the same places to visit, growing up in the same city, liking animals etc.  I teased her a bit about her eating habits and things like that.  Everything very playful and friendly.  I tend to keep this up for a bit to see if she's comfortable with me. At the end of the date she basically said she's glad I didn't run off (jokingly) and she had a good time with me haha.   So I know she's at least a little bit interested in me.  I'm not sure if it's just friends or possible relationship yet.\n\nHow do I go from a playful/friendly type of conversation to a more flirtatious and sexual?  It doesn't take me long to know that I like a girl and find her attractive but I have trouble expressing that to her. Does anyone have any advice about steering the date from a  friendly tone to a more sexual tone?\nTL;DR:"}

I am not as emotionally stable as I once was and I've fallen out of shape big time. I think I don't have as much self worth because I based my worth on my athletic success. Within the past couple of weeks I have had panic attacks and crippling insecurity. Through all of this I have done my best to not project this on to my sweet and loving girlfriend. I used to never care when she went out with her guy friends. Now I feel panicked when she does. I feel scared of losing her most of the time. It's like the rational part of my brain knows she's never hurt me and never will but the irrational side keeps thinking she's with someone else or that I've always done something wrong. I get jealous when she goes out and become really clingy. I have tried shutting it out but it just doesn't work. I really need help trying to work through this not just for my relationship but for my own mental health. What can I try? I don't want to go to therapy before trying things on my own.\nTL;DR:"}

Not a big deal, except there are two relocation reimbursement packages. In one package, everything is just covered by the company, but they organize and cover everything.\n\nThe other (and seemingly better) option is a lump sum of $5,000. With this money, I could easily drive myself there, move my stuff, and pay a month or three of rent on a nice apartment.

Now it wasn't a cute little mewing sound, mind you. He would screech at the top of his lungs like an angry cat. \nHis friends tried to apologetically tell me that they liked my Halloween costume. I thanked them and mentioned they should simply state that, rather than making animal sounds at people since it is very rude.\n\nWell Cat Ass stops to talk to his friends for a moment as I walk to the opposite end of the platform. I guess he didn't like what I said so he decided to follow me down on his bike. As the MRRROW ROW got closer and closer, I waited patiently,  pretending to still be purchasing a ticket.\n\nAt the last moment I swung around and took up the whole platform, standing right in front of him. He had to break hard to keep from hitting me or swerving into the chasm containing the tracks. I told him he should be more careful, one of us could have gotten very hurt then turned away and took my ticket.\n\nHe sat down and shut up for the rest of the wait.\nTL;DR:"}

So anyway, me and my family go to a smaller town on a field trip one day to see the local culture. \n  \nWe stop to eat at a nice caf\u00e9. We order some drinks. When the waiter comes he spills the entire drink on me. I'm pretty pissed but he said he was sorry and accidents can happen, it wasn't on purpose. But my pants and shirt got totally wet and I had to spend the remaining time trying to dry off with several trees worth of napkins. \n  \nWhen we are to pay I say I want a small discount because I had to go buy a new tshirt and the market next to the caf\u00e9. I mean I couldn't walk around with a huge stain on my shirt all day (the pants were fine somehow). I ask for a couple of dollars of discount. The waiter doesn't really understand and talks to the guy behind the bar. The talk in Turkish but I hear the word idiot several times and I know he is meaning me. I get pissed off but accept their lower discount because I really just want to get out of there. They were scumbags.

I was like, \"uh, no, I like my hair right now and it's not long\" and she would not have it! She just said things like \"Do it for your mom!\" and \"Your hair looks really bad\" and worst, she would just yell \"Thank you!\" over and over as if I had agreed to the haircut while she walked away because she didnt want to talk about it anymore.\n\nAnother example. I went grocery shopping with my mom and she decided to get a box of like 30 cookies for my dad. I was so upset cause my dad is diabetic so I told her to leave them for that reason. All she kept saying was, \"if I dont get them, he'll find cookies somewhere else!\" and \"your dad needs a treat!\" and all this shit, never addressing my concerns. Anyway, I ended up stealing the cookies from her cart at checkout and putting them back.

I feel very isolated and almost condemned by the girls in my class at medical school. The class is small - only 150 people. I work hard to get good grades, and people come to me to ask questions if they need help. I think this would sit well with most everyone, but I happen to have gotten good genes and I am, according to many people, very pretty. I also play a lot of sports and eat healthy. The problem is, I feel like no matter how hard I try to befriend the girls in my class, they always end up disliking me for seemingly no reason at all. They mock me a lot, but usually make it seem like a compliment (\"Oh, how does it feel to be such a pretty smarty-pants?\" \"Stop being so smart, it's annoying\" \"Why are you in med school, go marry a rich guy\"), but I know they are being serious to a degree. Some girls abruptly stop talking to me without any reason, and ignore me when I try to start conversation. Another problem is many male students will befriend me and eventually admit they have interest in a relationship, and even though I try to salvage the friendship, it is never the same. The only friends I feel I can keep from mysteriously disliking me are guys that have no interest in me (I believe) and the gay people in my class. I have tried many things: wearing sweats to classes, stop helping people with work feigning lack of knowledge, and in general trying to be extra nice to the girls in my class (invite people over for dinner, etc). Furthermore, I am a rather awkward person by nature, therefore that doesn't help ease the friend-making process. I'm at a loss of what I can do.

It's finals season, so stress has been high.  We're frequently in close contact, so one of us could have caught it from another.  At first glance it seems to me that there is no reason to suspect the mattress.\n\nHowever, googling [memory foam respiratory] yields many results that make me think that there might actually be something to this.  My difficulty is that I keep running into sites that outline the health risks of memory foam, and then try to sell me something organic.  It's either that, or individual testimonials.  As far as I can tell, these testimonials suffer from all of the uncertainty of my own situation: inability to separate correlation from causation. \n\nDepending on whether our symptoms persist, I'll conduct my own study to see if I should return the mattress.

I started working at my dad's business recently, and right next door there's a sandwich place I go to almost every day. There's a girl there that I found attractive, and eventually because of how frequently I go there, she remembers my name and always addresses me by it when she sees me walk in. I recently found out that she goes to the same university as me and that she's a junior. Being that I'm a sophomore I wasn't surprised that I had never seen her around campus, given different majors/classes/schedules/etc. \n\nMy main issue is finding an appropriate time to talk to her. I'm already shy given my track record with dating and my appearance (acne), and as said before I haven't seen her on campus before. So my only option really is to talk to her at her work which sounds like a nightmare. She's nice to me but I'm guessing that's mainly because she's nice to every customer and has a cheerful/friendly personality with everyone that walks in. I know it's creepy, but I found her profile on Facebook and it seems that she isn't in any sort of relationship. I'm just pretty confused right now and kind of down because I'm already assuming I won't be able to talk to her/she'll reject me. \n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is, how can I approach her and make conversation?

I just worry I'm the only one putting love in the relationship.

She mentioned that she is not looking for a relationship now but that she feels that she will regret her decision about this as well. \n\nHere is what I don't understand. I'm not friendzoned, nor are we in a relationship. She called it a \"gray-area\" in between. I'm trying to figure this out. All her friends have said we have amazing chemistry and that they want us to date, and she has even said that I'm one of the best people she has ever met and that \"what will be will be.\" Is she saying that I was too quick, or that she's not ready but wants to try at some point?

He has relatively recently started snoring loudly and consistently at night. It has been a combination of drinking (even just a beer or glass of whiskey each night) and weight gain (we think?). Also, he fidgets a ton and his moving and rolling around shakes me awake. It ends up with me either getting very little, shitty sleep where I have to nudge him to stop snoring all throughout the night, or me moving to another bed or couch.\n\nWe do not live together and fortunately he has two beds and two rooms at his house, so I just sleep upstairs. When he sleeps at my place (no extra bed or room) I'm almost guaranteed to not get sleep.\n\nFor me, sleeping separately benefits me far greater than sharing a bed.

She's been getting clingy and it's been pressuring me just a touch. We've had the space talk before. I am happy with her overall, so is she, but sometimes I feel as if we are together because there is nothing else sometimes. This is my first relationship that has gone past 6 months.  \n  \nMy crush is a work crush. We only talk at work. We share a few common interests and I enjoy talking to her. A lot. I've been talking to her more often recently but still, only ever at work. Face to face or work email. She has mentioned being single a few times and mentioned ex-boyfriends but I have avoided revealing my relationship status. I flirt lightly as does she, I think, I can't read her. She gives signs someday, but the next, nothing. Or we just won't talk for a few days since i dont want to be bother and initiate conversation first.  \n  \nIn my head, since she revealed, subtly, her single status and takes to my lame jokes, she may be interests. What has been eating at me for a couple weeks is I need to know for sure. Even though I'm in a relationship, I just have to know as I like her a lot. I want to hint about communication via texts instead of work only but still keep it friendly just to see if she would go for it.  \n  \nI love my girlfriend and we are generally happy. But as i mentioned before, sometimes it feels as if we're together out of convenience since we both suck socially. I'll be hurt if this ends but not knowing if my crush likes me too and thought of, \"what if she's the one?\" Kills me.\nTL;DR:"}

I do not like children. I regularly fantasize about fucking them. In fact, I find it difficult to get my rocks off to anything else these days, apart from regular rape fantasies. I have engaged in bestiality.\n\nI also fantasize (non-sexually) about killing large amounts of people. I have considered constructing explosives or weapons and attempting mass murder. \nI find it difficult to empathize with any human, even family and those who I have known for some time.

Because I am a failure, I am unable to afford these drugs. However, given the chance I would easily become an alcoholic/drug addict, because I abuse these on every occasion possible.\n\nAs mentioned above, I have largely failed to achieve anything in my life. Although recognised as being an intelligent individual (which I believe I am) in childhood, my schooling and subsequent university studies have failed to achieve anything significant because of my complete lack of motivation.

My plan at the start of the lease was to stay till the end of April and lease out the remaining months of the contract.\n\nI've recently grown tired of putting up with my roommates poor habits (which I have addressed multiple times), and am looking into moving to a new home. I have found a nice house shared with a couple listed at $985/month, all inclusive. This house is much nicer and the housemates are very similar to me in terms of expectations. It would require me to commute 25 minutes to school so that adds on $108 monthly for transit costs.\n\nIf I moved, it would require me to find someone to sublet my current room immediately. I am wondering if this would be a smart move for me, from a financial and well being point of view. My roommates are not bad people per se, we just have different standards on cleanliness and sharing household items. I am trying to negotiate down the price of the new home. I am also wondering if I am able to sublet my current room at a rate higher than what I am paying? I gave my landlord pre-dated cheques so any subletter I find would be paying me directly.\nTL;DR:"}

We kind of make a joke out of it, but underneath the joke it's pissing me off a little bit. Whenever I ask \"what do you want to do?\" when we're hanging out, the answer is always \"I don't care\". I know that she says it because she honestly doesn't care, she just likes spending time together. I know that I'm perfectly capable of making a decision - to watch a movie, or a show on netflix, or just start making out - but honestly, it'd be really damn nice to have her come up with a plan for once. \n\nIt goes into the bedroom a bit, as well. We haven't had sex yet, although I think it'll happen soon. She's been spending the night a few times a week, and we usually go a little farther each time she comes over - making out and cuddling, and then making out/cuddling while shirtless, and then without pants, and then fingering her for the first time the last time she came over - although she still hasn't really touched my dick.\n\nI get that she's a virgin and almost certainly nervous, but honestly I'd love it if she would just pull off my pants and give me a blowjob. She's very confident making out - she'll pull me on top of her, or grab my shirt when I'm not kissing her hard enough, so I think the issue is just that she's never gone this far with a guy, and so she doesn't really know what to do. The last girl I dated had no issues with just sticking her hand in my pants and rubbing my dick, so I'm a little unsure of how to take the lead and still make sure I'm doing everything right.\n\nI know that we need to have a conversation about sex and indecisiveness, I just hate bringing up awkward conversations like that.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by not knowing how to use an EpiPen\nPOST: A little backstory first.\n\nMy father has never been allergic to anything in his life, but last week he got stung by a bee while fixing the fence. At first, it was just a normal sting, but within 6 hours he was *completely* covered in hives. We went to urgent care and they thought it was an allergic reaction to the sting. They told us a person can suddenly develop an allergy. They said these kinds of reactions only get worse with each sting, and the next time he gets stung could be a real emergency. They sent us home with 2 EpiPen auto injectors.\n\nThe fuckup.  Well next week my dad was working on the fence again, and guess what. He got stung by a bee.. and he did not have the injector! He was far from the house, he called me from his phone and told me what happened. I grabbed a pen from the box that was not even opened yet, and hopped on my 4wheeler to drive over to him. By the time I got there he was freaking out pretty bad.  I was kind of panicked and trying to read how to operate the thing. Whoever designed it is very smart, because It's pretty simple. 2 steps. [Step 1. Remove blue safety, STEP 2. Swing into thigh.](\nWell I somehow managed to fuck that up.  I removed the blue safety and jammed that end into his leg. I assumed the safety was covering the needle. I was wrong. My thumb was on the orange part where the needle springs from. As soon as I hit his leg the needle injected into my thumb.  At this point my dad was pretty pissed, and I was sure we were both going to die haha.  We both rode back to the house so he could get the other injector, and by the time we got there my thumb stopped hurting and my whole turned white and numb. My dad decided he did not even need the second pen because he felt fine, and it might not even have been a bee that stung him. Good news, my dad never had a reaction. Bad news, it took 6 hours for my hand to feel better.\nTL;DR:"}

I want to be taxed accurately.\nPOST: I have a Roth IRA that I opened with a previous employer. The company deducted my contribution before taxes and matched it, dumping the total into the account for me. Now I'm with a different employer that does a 401k that way but doesn't seem to offer the option of deducting a portion of my pre-tax pay to my now-personal IRA. \n\nI am maxed on the new company's match for the 401k, but would like to continue putting some in my IRA. What I'm confused about (and why I haven't contributed since getting a new job) is how the tax situation works. If I contribute to the account using my net pay, will this somehow be known by the IRS? Or do they assume that contributions are pre-tax and assess me on that basis, effectively taxing me twice on my pay?\n\nOn the subject: is it a better idea to just let the IRA sit (as is, it's projected to be around $30k when I retire) and only contribute to the 401k? I could just increase the amount going into the 401k--it just won't be matched beyond what it is now.\nTL;DR:"}

And I've basically been saying that to him every two months when I go in for a cut. \n\nHe has started to practically beg me to grow it out even when I explain to him how weird it is to me and that i don't feel comfortable or like myself with longer hair. When I asked why he wanted me to grow out he just repeated that he wants me try something new. \n\nThen he took it a little to far for me and bought me wigs to wear without consulting me first. I had no interest in whigs before but would have been open to trying some if he had talked to me first. \n\nI am really starting to feel like he is not attracted to me with my current short hair... I have an ass and boobs and an hourglass figure and I've never been mistaken as a man or anything... And I get a compliment on my haircut at least once every time I go out.

What 20% of effort receives 80% of the results. I've applied this approach to working out, my diet and now I want to see if I can apply it to my work life.\n\nI know Ferriss has the 4 Hour Work Week which talks about lifestyle design and being able to work whilst enjoying your life. But, that's more for a professional environment. I work as a waiter in a restaurant! Typical film school graduate! So at the moment, I put in 80% of effort only to receive 20% income (minimum wage). I work hard and get little.\nObviously, I'm grateful I even have a job! The economy isn't great right now in the UK, jobs are hard to find. And I'm blessed with food on my table, a bed to sleep in at night, friends and family to hang out with. But I just want to sort out or \"hack\" my work life.\n\nSo I was wondering what jobs or careers are out there (worldwide) where you put in 20% of the effort to receive 80% income.\n\nThe one that comes to mind for me is blogging / vlogging. Minimum effort required, staying at home typing up a blog post about your daily adventures for example. Or filming a typical day in your life (vlogging).\n\nAnyone else have any ideas of jobs or careers that work around the 80/20 principle.\n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:"}

I go to grade 11 and I asked this one girl out about 2 months ago. I knew her through a school project that lasted around 3 weeks and another one that lasted 2 weeks. It was fun to be around her. I told one of my close friends that I have feelings about her, and they said she was different in a cheery and happy way when I'm around. So that felt good, plus she was the one who wanted ME to be her partner for the second project. \n\nFast forward a few days later, and I wanted to ask her out. First I was like \"Hey Jenny I wanted to talk to you about something\" but she said she had to run because she had her ride waiting for her as she needed to go to the doctor(she really did, I remember).\n\nThen, she texts me \"What is it that you wanted to say?\"\n\nAfter many \"I'll tell you later\"s I told her that \"This is harder than I thought\" to which she replied \"Look I think what you mean and I'm sorry, I think I just want to be friends\"\n\nAnd that was basically it.\n\nNow, the main issue. The thing is, I can't forget about her. The other girls in my school are either in a relationship or just generally bad(I live in a crappy area). This is really killing me and I WANT to forget about her but my brain is constantly reminding me of her. It has become torture for me to always have to think about her cause I liked her so much. Please give me tips on what to do.\n\nOther thing. Every day during break, she goes to a class that I like cause the teacher there has interesting chats with us about random stuff and I find it really intriguing. I go there too occasionally and I go there ONLY for the awesome teacher and not for Jenny. Do you think this is going to make her feel creepy? Also, do you ever think she will change her decision and MAYBE like me and then tell me somehow? \n\nThanks so much. I want a \"kicker\" or some good advice that will take me out of always thinking about her and get me to something else. Thanks again. Bye.\nTL;DR:"}

We mutually broke up so that neither of us would be angry with each other which made the last hour that I had with her extremely hard, because the thing is I found her perfect and we were compatible with each other, but we felt that it would be best to call it off. \n\nAfter we said our awkward, tearful goodbyes I got into my car and started sobbing. She told me this morning that when she entered her house she did the same thing as she watched me pull away. And here's my question: If this is meant to be, if it's truly best to break up, then why does it hurt so bad? Why are both of us sobbing and miserable? Why did neither of us sleep last night and why do we miss each other more than anything in the world? I don't know what to do and I just feel empty. I've felt a pit in my stomach and I feel extremely nauseous. This amazing girl was my first girl friend and I was her first boyfriend which probably adds to the sentiment. I feel lost and I probably mostly need someone to talk to. I would appreciate a response from anybody. Thanks for the long read.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm involved in a number of nonprofit and community engagement efforts on behalf of other people.  I'm perpetually volunteering for breast cancer awareness fairs and cultural heritage festivals and arts engagement and things of that sort.\n\nHowever, I've noticed that many events that would probably have mass appeal in the community (such as a beer and country music night to support Big Brothers/Big Sisters) tend to not be well known outside of the small coterie of people who read the newspaper or are among the centralized group in my town who seems to run or have a hand in everything.  This group tends to be disproportionately white and older.\n\nI get frustrated by the low attendance at events, and I get even more frustrated when I hear people say that there's never anything happening.  When I tell people about all the stuff that's going on, they say that they hadn't heard.\n\nThis isn't from lack of trying.  These groups have FB pages, Twitter accounts, newspaper articles in the local paper, local TV coverage, and several community calendars, but to my untrained eyes, it doesn't look like its working.  So, in the interest of trying to find out if there's something that I'm missing that would be really useful, I cast this question upon the mercies of the Reddit community.  Let me know your ideas or methods because I honestly would like things to get better.\n\nHope you're having a fantastic day,\n\n-JMF\nTL;DR:"}

My ex ended up moving in next door to me and we quickly became really close. He was on exchange for a year from a university in England, and we hit it off FAST.\n\nBecause of the fact that our units were next to each other, we ended up living together. We cooked together, stayed together every night, studied together etc. But we knew that he would be have to go back to England to complete his Masters. We discussed this early into the relationship, and decided on a mutual breakup for when he leaves. At the time I thought, \"yeah, I can handle this. I have a lot of time to prepare, we'll just enjoy this while it lasts.\" \n\nI was very wrong. We fell so in love with one another, and he became my best friend. He's been back in England for almost two months now, but we still talk like we are a couple, and we ended up planning a trip together. In about three weeks, I am going to England for two weeks to travel with him (his suggestion, but we had both talked about it before)\n\nI'm not really sure how to approach the time in between, before I go to England. We act like a couple, skyping/messaging (he recently sent me a letter telling me he loved me and a handmade bookmark from a tree in his garden) but we haven't explicitly talked about what this is.\n\nI don't know if we are casually seeing other people? Just the other night he said he was meeting a female friend to catch up, but he messaged me when he got home and that was almost 5 am his time and kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, because I automatically assumed things, despite how every other day he tells me he misses me and talks about all the things he is planning for when I am there.\n\nDo I wait until I'm there to have that conversation about what this is? I know communication is absolutely key, but I don't want to risk awkwardness/disappointment before going there, and sometimes things are miss-communicated when not talking face to face.

She would also take me to very expensive dinners and pay for all of it, but never let me see the bill. I never really thought much of it because I came from an upper-middle class family and do pretty well for myself\n\nLast night, though, the mutual friend that had introduced us (Kate) told me that Jennifer is rich.

She owns three.\n\nI am not a gold digger by any means but this has definitely changed how I've looked at her.

However, the biggest issue for us was that our cultures were different, I'm Pakistani and she's Indian. While we were together the thought of my mom not accepting her into my family always lingered in my girlfriend's mind, but she wanted me to tell my mom about us. Knowing how it would end I told my mom and the result was what I expected, my mom wasn't having it. I told my girlfriend about my argument with my mom and even though she was happy I told my mom, she couldn't handle it and we broke up. So the break up is pretty fresh and now she's talking to and spending time with this other guy. We talked about it and she says that she's emotionally weak and always pushes herself to the next guy that gives her attention. I found out through her that they kissed and hang out. She then says that the time we had was special and that the feelings we shared were genuine. As much as I believe her I still and I understand her weakness and that she needs to work on that on her own, I can't help but feel used. I feel like what we had between us meant nothing to her. I told her this and she says that its not the case but I see them on campus from time to time and I know I can't do anything but I turn into the crazy ex-boyfriend and I stare at them.

It is the brand of shoe I felt the most comfortable in, and had never considered any other brand.\n\nI kept reading in this subreddit that if you want to avoid injury or funky toenails, you should seek out the advice of a person at a specialty store.  I didn't really consider it because I thought my Asics were sufficient.  However, after increasing mileage and getting even move serious about running, I had started to notice my toes feeling achy after going about 4 miles.  I went out in search of Asics again, thinking maybe I needed a bigger size.  When talking to the sales guy, he said he ran marathons and that he would go to Sun and Ski Sport and they were really helpful in fitting him with comfortable shoes.   He said before I committed to spending $150 on some black Asics, I should at least check out S&SS, and he would hold the shoes for me if I didn't find anything else.  I thought that was awesome - he sacrificed a sale so that a fellow runner would feel more comfortable running.  I headed straight there, and the sales guy took the time to watch me walk and let me try on about 10 pairs.\n\nAnd I found them.  The most lightweight, comfortable and breathable shoes I have ever slid my feet into.  Saucony Triumph ISO 2.

I have never worn make-up or spent any substantial amount of time on my looks unless it was a special occasions like a party, dinner with one of our families, etc. The other night he told me that he's very upset that I don't do these things. That he sees other girls going to class in with make-up on and in a nice outfit and it makes him depressed that I don't. (we have no classes together) When I told him that I didn't really want to do that he insisted this was only because I dislike preppy girls and didn't want to be seen as one. It's not. I like make-up, I just consider daily usage of it a waste of time when I look perfectly fine without it. \n\nHe also says that I don't put any effort into us while he puts in a lot. The thing is, I don't see that. I'm in an aggressive major, taking 22 credits, and working 10 hours a week, but I still take the time to visit him at his apartment at least once a week, often more than that. During these visits I rarely have the energy to do much. We normally watch a TV show or play card games or adult activities. It upsets him that I'm not more social/energetic during these visits. I guess I should add that he is taking 14 credits and doesn't have a job.\n\nThe things he said hurt me a lot and I don't know what to do. I tried to explain that I just don't have the time to work on my looks constantly and didn't understand why this suddenly bothered him. The comments about my not putting in effort really offend me because I can't think of one thing he does that I'd consider \"effort\" on his part other than make me tea when I ask him to....\nTL;DR:"}

One of these friends was a girl I started sleeping with. Was just a semi-drunken bit of fun and I never thought anything of it.\n\nI then moved away, went to work in a different country for a year. Kept moderately in touch through facebook and things, but just as friends. But this was when I started to think about her a bit more.\n\nI came back for a week last christmas and met up with everybody. Turns out there'd been some messed up scenario between her and another girl.

Since then, the girl I like has been pretty much kicked from the group of friends.

We're best friends, we laugh and cry together, make out on the couch together and tell each other how much we love each other 5+ times a day - and all of the other fairy-tale relationship things. We were high-school sweethearts and are very much in love.\nOnly problem is, our sex life sucks.\n\nI seem to have whittled it down to the fact that she was my first sexual partner. I lust after female co-workers, friends and even random people I see, even the 'average' ones, thinking of all the naughty things I'd do to them.

Most of the time, I don't feel like doing those naughty things with my girlfriend, and it's almost to the point that I'm not sexually attracted to her like I used to be (lust dies after a few years though, we all know that). Don't get me wrong, she is GORGEOUS. She still wants and tries to initiate sex with me but sometimes, I just can't do it... literally.\n\nI want to spend the rest of my life with her because we click so well in every single other area and I love spending time with her, but our bedroom life has just gotten stale. We've tried talking about it some, but I can never really verbalize my desire, to tell her that \"I need to fuck other women before I can settle down\".

I've never been in a relationship or kissed a girl or been on a date mainly because of my shyness during secondary school and below, but since I have started university I've become a lot more confident, my main problem is, I'm a professional gamer and I stay in a lot, but when I go out I literally can't stand going to clubs or pubs.\n\nTo me it just seems like everyone wants to get drunk I and really don't want to meet someone on the premesis that they may like me because they're drunk. I have a really good sense of humour too but I find drunk people just so obnoxious towards me (male and female), would probably be different if I drank alcohol too and got into the same state as them.\n\nI'm moderately attractive, have a fun personality and would consider myself as a 100% nice guy as I tend not to make jokes at other peoples expenses, stay mature most of the time and would do anything for someone I love, all of my friends constantly ask me how I'm still single and Its mainly due to not wanting to go to clubs to meet people and thinking I'm out of most girls \"leagues\" so to speak.\n\nSo moving on from that, where could I go to find mature women? I'm not bothered if they drink a bit but I don't want someone who feels life is just to party the night away every single day, I want someone who I can relate to and is pretty much intelligent as I find intelligence is the biggest factor in a girl for me. I play a lot of snooker at a high level but you tend not to meet many women in a snooker club, any tips on where I could go? any new activities I could take up to meet women, or just anything I can do, I really am open to anything, JUST NOT CLUBS AND TOO MUCH ALOCHOL! :)\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Confused and in need of advice from males\nPOST: I'll start with some background to try to clarify where I'm coming from. So my very close guy friend, who I'll refer to as John, and I spend tons of time together. We can talk to each other about anything. We get along very well, but I've had feelings for him since last September. This last week, we were out with some friends and had too much to drink. He was sober enough to drive when we left the bar, so he took me back to his place. After a little while, he started feeling the effects of the alcohol he drank. We were in his bed and started caressing each other and kissing. We almost hooked up, but decided not to since drunk decisions are not the best. Now, a day or so later, I stayed at his place again and sexual tension started to build even further. Nothing happened that night, but we started talking about us being a couple since there were intimate feelings to some extent from both ends now. The next night I stayed with him again and I couldn't stand the tension anymore. I kissed him and we had sex. The next morning I felt great, but he felt a sense of guilt. After giving him some space to think things over, he felt that it wasn't a good idea for us to date because he thinks he might have feelings for men. He still really wants to remain close and have nothing change from before (except obviously not having sex/kissing). I really want to remain close to him too. I'm confused what's happening and what to make of this though. I'm very torn and hurt, mainly because admittedly, he was my first. I love him and would do anything for him. I'm just not sure what to make of this. Is it possible to go through a time of being bicurious where you just lose interest in the opposite gender? That happened to me in middle school, but I don't know if that's a common/normal thing. Advice? Is it possible that we might be together in the future?\nThank you so much in advance for any input!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: F(21)Had drunk hookup with best guy friend M(23). What now?\nPOST: So I had to make a throwaway account because my friend knows my other reddit username. Me and this guy have been best friends for about 4 years, we met at university we were both single at the time but there was no attraction there on my part. Flash forward to the incident. We were hanging out at my place just having some beers watching a movie. He kept getting me beer after beer and I being comfortable/drunk kept accepting them. He wasn't drinking as much as me. I ended up blacking out, waking up alone at my place figuring he just left. Two weeks later he revealed to me that we had hooked up (apparently everything but intercourse).I don't remember it at all. This guy has a girlfriend that he's been with since he was 21 and they live together. I can't believe this has happened I'm so mortified. I've never thought about this guy in that way EVER and never blacked out from drinking before. I don't know what to do at all, he said he wants to break up with his girlfriend to be with me because he told me his felt this way for a long time but I don't have feelings like that towards him. I don't even remember it.Obviously I feel like a complete idiot for what happened, I don't know how to deal with this. On the one hand I feel like the trust is completely broken how long has he been hiding his true feelings.  On the other, I'm disgusted with myself for doing that with someone who obviously I care about as a friend but is in a relationship and I am not sexually attracted to. In addition, ever since I found out Ive felt lost, wondering how it got this way. Clearly I'm struggling with how to deal with what happened, so reddit help me if you can.\nTL;DR:"}

I got officially dumped by my alcoholic bf of 3 years two weeks after I left our shared apartment, because I couldn't stand the drinking and associated BS anymore. He determined it would be no contact an I respected that. He texts me yesterday saying he's sorry for how it ended, wishes he could turn back time, loves me, blah blah blah. Just ripping that wound right back open. I told him I needed time to heal and asked him not to contact me, he agreed, and JUST NOW I get a fuckig text from my PREVIOUS ex asking forgiveness for his infidelity... That was 5 years ago! WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS HAPPENING?!?! \n\nI'm not responding to anything from either of them as I've found that ignoring people is the best way to get them to leave you alone but holy fucking shit can a girl just be left the fuck alone\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: Need advice on the best way to take my cat away from a home he loves.\nPOST: In my first year of college I adopted a kitten, Eli. (He is 14 months old now) He lived with me for a little while but ended up living with my family, five hours away from my college.\n\nMy family consists of two teenage boys, a 12 year old girl and my mom and dad. We have a pug and another cat. Eli loves my dad and brother. He purrs for only them, follows them around the house, and only goes to them when he wants to be pet. Neither of them feed him, change his little box, or provide him with fresh water. (My mom and I do that) He likes the rest of us but they are his favorites.\n\nStarting in September, I'm moving to a small apartment at school and am taking Eli to live with me.  I am not going to have any roommates, I am taking him for my own wellbeing. I will take him back whenever I go back.  (All of the university holidays and breaks)\n\nDo you think he will be okay moving from such an active and happy household to a lonely small apartment? I am nervous the total change of environment will be too drastic for him.  Any tips on how to make the transition a more pleasant one?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My love interest [18M] is afraid to get physical with me [18F] for moral/familial/religious reasons\nPOST: So I'm in college, and throughout the year I've developed a strong friendship with this wonderful guy (who I will refer to as H.) from South Asia. He's brilliant and has the social skills of a rock - think Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind - but I care so much for him. He's delightfully irreverent and witty and I finally went straight up to him a few nights ago and told him I was interested in him.\n\nH. said he reciprocated, stating enigmatically \"if there is anyone I would break the rules for, it would be you.\" I did not go further that night since I knew how reserved he was and how shy I was (I have never thought romantically of anyone before). But last night, put off by the distance he was keeping, I asked H. if he was physically attracted to me.\n\nH. told me he would be ashamed if that were the case - that he considers physical desire degrading to the regard he holds for me. He was raised in a very conservative Muslim family and he has resigned himself to an eventual, unhappy arranged marriage (no betrothal - just hypothetical), and claims he does this not out of lack of interest in me, but out of loyalty to his family. I tried to explain my POV, that physical attraction is a good and natural progression of a deep-seated mental connection, and that it is nothing to be ashamed of. H. understood me, and was upset when I admitted my disappointment and told him to forget I ever had feelings for him, since nothing could be done. He will not allow himself to desire me. H. is intellgent and insightful, and it saddens me that he cannot see past these constraints.\n\nWe speak very frankly with each other; communication is not an issue. I cannot help desiring him physically, and I sense that he would too if he allowed himself to. Is there anything to be done?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [24 M] of 2 1/2 years, feeling comfortable but not passionate.\nPOST: My boyfriend and I aren't passionate together. I've been okay with that, because we're great together. I could go on for so long about everything I love about him. He's kind, patient, understanding... I'm so comfortable, I feel like I could spend my entire life with him and be happy.\n\nHappy, but not entirely satisfied. It's like there's this inexplicable hole that he's not filling - or *I'm* not filling. Everybody talks about this being a more \"mature\" kind of love, but I seriously feel like I'm missing something from my life.\n\nWe have sex maybe twice a year. Maybe less. He has more of a sex drive than I do, but he never complains about it. He has never once tried to push me farther than I want to go. We cuddle every day and night, but it hasn't led to sex in over 6 months because *I* haven't felt the desire. I find him attractive, objectively, but I don't *feel* that attraction.\n\nI feel like this is more of a personal issue because I don't feel that attraction to anyone. I want it to be with him. But I don't know how, and I'm terrified of talking to him about my feelings on this. I don't want him to be sad, or think he's not enough, or think I want to leave him. I think this is more of an internal struggle. I think I might be addicted to the drama of past relationships, and confusing that all for passion. My anger fueled my sex drive in the past. And I'm never really angry at him. There's nothing to be angry about. He's genuinely a great person.\n\nIs it unfair of me to hold onto him so tightly when I'm secretly feeling this way? I think I might be being selfish, because I can't imagine not being with him, but wouldn't he be better off with somebody who felt crazy about him, who satisfied all his sexual desires?\n\nSo, do I talk to him about this? Or how do I deal with this on my own?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Can anyone give me some insight into a legal situation I have right now? Details inside.\nPOST: 11 1/2 months ago the police showed up at my home because they had received an anonymous tip that I trafficked child pornography. I have no involvement whatsoever, and never had any involvement in child pornography. So they had their search warrant, confiscated my computers, hard drives, iPhone, etc. But they also found 2 pills of Exstacy, that they seized as well.\n\nSo after 7 mos of investigation they release all my belongings back to me except for my iPhone, and the detective tells me through my lawyer that he is going to recommend to the county prosecutor to charge me with felony possession of Exstacy. The only reason I can think they kept my iPhone is because I had a couple photos of marijuana on there. This was October 16th.\n\nHere it is February 22nd, 49 weeks after they came to my home and confiscated my belongings. I haven't been charged with anything, and I have no warrants. I have an appointment to see my lawyer tomorrow because obviously I would like to get some closure on this. In the summer I have plans to move out of state and would hate to have this come back and bite me in the ass.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with situations like this? Why would they sit on it this long? I am 100% innocent of the child porn stuff and they saw that after investigating my stuff. Is there any action I can take against the police/prosecutor/etc for dragging this out so long? Isn't there due process or something?\nTL;DR:"}

Since I have made this decision, I have remained sober... Completely.   She has not.  She still takes pills, still drinks.  When she confesses that she has taken a pill or drank,  I don't give her shit about it.  I don't give her ultimatums.  I don't demean her and I don't insult her.  I don't guilt trip her.  I helped a friend out today and he offered to smoke some pot with me (pretty much the only thing I did before I was sober).  I tell her that I was contemplating taking him up on the offer.  She gets pissed.  Starts calling me weak.  Starts threatening to rat my friend out to his probation officer.  In the middle of all this, she admits she took a pill today without even bothering to get my input (no surprise). Yet, she still won't relent and continues to brow-beat, threaten, and insult me further.  She then comes over to my apartment, gets her shit saying she will not be with me because I'm choosing pot over her.  How and the fuck can someone justify being such a gigantic hypocrite?! (Bear in mind I didn't even fucking smoke yet. I never answered my friends text).\nTL;DR:"}
