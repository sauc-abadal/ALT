Should I take a year in industry, or try to get out ASAP?\nPOST: Hi /r/advice, first time poster here so sorry if I break a rule.\n\nI'm currently studying Physics and Computer Science at Aberystwyth university, which is pretty low in the league tables and falling quickly(in 2011 we were 49th in the Guardian's league tables and for 2016 we're 110th - it only goes up to 119). \n\nI'm understandably annoyed at this since when I applied here, the university was showing up as pretty average and now we're in the bottom 10%, but I'm not sure what to do in order to limit the damage the crapness of the university can do to my future. \n\nOn my course there's an option to take a year out to work in industry as a paid intern- it doesn't affect the degree I get at the end, but it'd give me a year's experience working full time in the kinds of sector I would like to go into, while letting me save a bit of money for the future. On the other hand it would mean staying here for another year, which is time in which more and more employers are going to notice that this is one of the lowest ranked universities in the country.\n\n___\n\nIf you're a recruiter for a physics/compsci related field, would you prefer a candidate from an unknown university with no experience or one from a uni that's known for being badly ranked, with a year of it?\n\nIf you're a graduate who was in my position, any advice at all on whether employers actually noticed your uni wasn't as prestigious as a Russell group, and whether they valued candidates who took a year in industry, would be appreciated too. Thanks in advance. \n\n___\nTL;DR:"}

I have a degree in business. Originally one of my parents was suppose to help me pay a large amount of my loans when I signed up for school but this has not happened and honestly now I don't count on it at all. \n\nI'm honestly terrified of my debt, embarrassed and ashamed. I'm working on buckling down on paying my debt as fast as possible, which means putting myself on more strict budget. As of right now I'm currently paying $1039 a month toward all my loans and pay the required payment without additional interest accruing. I'm also completely financially independent from my parents, I contribute to my 401k, pay my own rent, health insurance etc)\n\nWe have not talked moving in together let alone marriage at this time and I believe that would be about another 1 yr down the road before talking about moving in occurs. I don't want him to feel I'm lying to him or hiding it from him either. We have not had any financial conversations about specifics. He knows I have a good amount of student loans because I have mentioned it from the beginning that I pay student loans but I'm pretty sure he doesn't realize the extent. His parent's are rather wealthy, I do know they paid for his school and they still pay for a good chunk of his bills. \n\nI don't know how to bring this up to him and I know I need to because if he wants to leave the relationship because its too much debt for a future I'm sure he and I would both like to know sooner vs later. I completely understand its a huge amount of debt for someone to potentially marry to down the road and because of that I'm terrified he will leave me. \n\nHow do I bring this up to him I don't want to wait until it's too late.

We were talking about it, and she found it very offensive that her sexuality made her seem more attractive to me.

This in addition to another comment I made, ended up in us breaking up.\n\nWe did not talk for about a month or two, and then on my birthday, she shows up at my house and apologized for the way things ended. We hugged it out, and then one thing turned into another, and we had sex again.\n\nWe've been talking a lot more now, we don't see each other a lot, but when we do, it leads to sex.

There are a multitude of issues going on right now, and she admits they are all her problems.  The most recent one that came up tonight is that she is jealous of me texting her sister about random shit, like something crazy I saw at work, or a gif from reddit, trying to start conversation.  I do this, because she has consistently complained to me in the past that her sister thinks that I hate her, and that we need to be closer.

I love my wife, but she is admittedly extremely jealous.

He spent it at first on family expenses, but started bringing in enough income eventually to be able to funnel it into a savings account for college tuition funds. Upon our turning 18 recently, the SSA required him to refund the amount he had been saving, labeling it as overpayment. He didn't waiver the repayment, and is under the assumption that we could file for a refund as adults, the benefits being under our names and managed by him as our guardian.\n\nWe're not completely dependent on the savings he made with the funds, but they were still an important factor in our college finances.

She been ill for a while now and most of us can see the end is near. I'm not particularly close to my family (or anyone really), but I like my grandmother and used to see her often as she only lives a few blocks away. \n\nThe problem is, this past year has been especially difficult for me personally. I've been struggling with bulimia and underwent a treatment program. In an attempt to avoid purging I ended up gaining A LOT of weight and I'm severely uncomfortable and haven't seen most of my family aside from my mother (who I live with) for several months. My family (three aunts from 50s to 60 and two uncles in the same range) is not supportive, very judgmental, and has only ever been kind or praising of me when I would lose weight (yo-yoing weight is a new problem for me, I used to just be overweight).\n\nWith the eating disorder and other psychological problems I've been having, I haven't progressed very much in the past year outwardly. I finished my undergrad then did nothing but go to therapy. I'm really worried that being around my family is going to send me spiraling back into severe bulimia because I know that they will gang up on me, make me feel like shit for getting fat, and even bigger shit for not having a job or a boyfriend. I've been slipping into \"behaviors\" trying to find a way to look better before Christmas and I just don't want everything to get worse or end up in ER again.\n\nI know a lot of people will say \"just don't show up\" but that's not really an option and I'm not positive they won't call and interrogate me for not showing up (using my grandmother's failing health as a reason to shame me) or just come to me house because as I said, I live very close.\n\nThis probably seems like an easy issue to most people, but I'm not sure how to best handle the situation to avoid causing waves or undue stress.\nTL;DR:"}

In the last ~2 months though, i cheated once i think, and i was high as a kite then... \n\nMy biggest problem though at the moment, is finding stuff to eat that will help me keep on loosing weight, and wont take 10 years to prepare. \n\nAt the moment, my diet consists mostly of oranges, sometimes apples, and a soup once per day. \n\nI sometimes change the soup for some tuna fish and whole grain bread (usually 80gr baguettes, with seeds and all that stuff), or yogurt and whole grain baguette (same 80gr baguette). \n\nOne other thing that is not helping my diet, is beer. I often go out drinking with my coworkers/friends/whatever, and there's beer.... lots of beer. But i can say, that even after one week of drinking, i noticed that i still lost weight, maybe due to dehydration, or maybe not eating that much since i was drunk a lot of the time, but still.. \n\nI should also mention that i work the night shift, so normal schedule does not apply, since i wake up at ~4-5 PM, work from 7:00 PM to 3:30 AM, and go to sleep at ~8-9 AM.\nTL;DR:"}

On the interview I again asked him \"is this a 6 month contract and not a summertime one?\". He said yes it is. The next week the franchise sends me my contract that I needed to sign and send back. It was a summertime contract. This means no bonuses, and a lower salary. I've worked with him 3 weeks and he lied twice. \n\nOf course, a late payment is no problem. I also confronted him about him and he said he'll pay me next month. Unfortunately in the 6 months I worked for him prior to my unemployment (he was a new manager),he cheated on my hours three times. And every time the same answer. Like this time. I never got a penny from him. I doubt he'll pay me this time but I'll fight for it. I have recorded my hours. \n\nNow I want to leave. I don't trust this guy. I don't know why I went back to him, even my mom asked me why. But I have no other job and a lot of applications that aren't answered yet.\nTL;DR:"}

Most of his life he was living in the family home but in the new year I moved out and I've taken him with me. Every morning without fail, he barks between 6am and 7:25, when I get up to walk him. Sometimes he will bark maybe twice total during that period, more recently he's been barking almost non-stop. \n\nI never go in to the room whilst he's barking, I always wait until he's stopped for about 30 seconds. I also go in between 7:15-25 every single day. Sometimes he's better than others, but how do I eliminate it entirely? he's quite the velcro dog, always following me around or sitting next to me. \n\nAnother issue I have is that when I come back home he barks incessantly. Again, I don't go in until he's finished for about half a minute, but I don't think it's stopping him from starting barking. \n\nJust to give you an idea of the layout of his room, on one side there is a dog gate that looks into the living room and the other is a solid wood door that leads through a corridor to my bedroom, which is the door I go through in the morning and when I'm back.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Alright Reddit, I need some help with what I think is depression. Since you guys think like I do, I need some direction.\nPOST: So lately I've been coming to terms with the fact that I am most likely depressed. I'm familiar with the symptoms and I regrettably must admit that I most likely am depressed. The thought of me being depressed is in my mind associated with weakness and fragility and that causes me to become almost infuriated. I do however have the desire to see my family doctor and hopefully figure out if depression really is the problem. The difficulty with this (me being away at university) is that my family doctor is in my hometown where my parents live. I need to see my family doctor (I'm in Canada) without my parents knowing (for my own reasons) however it seems that it will be impossible to go to my own family doc without my parents being alerted. \n\n   As a side note, I have a condition that prevents me from taking the majority of anti-depressants there are. I know there are many non-medication options including therapy for me however I am naturally skeptical. I personally meditate on a regular basis and that helps keep my mind sound. Another interesting thing I have found is that when I smoke marijuana (I started much after I was already depressed), I find myself much happier, without any stress at all. These effects last not only during the high, but for the next few days. I'm not a regular stoner and it pains me to say, but it seems that I'm living day to day waiting for the next time I can get high so I can be happy again.\nTL;DR:"}

I love my children, and don't want to break up my family - but now I worry about raising them in a loveless household.\n\nMy wife has said in the past that if I contact the affair woman again she'll leave me.

This is a small town so everyone knows everyone and despite these arseholes having a very big opinion of themselves and their own importance, they're fairly well renowned for being gobshites.  \n\nHaving had a couple of unpleasant interactions with them (one of the ladies loudly attempting to tear me a new one for \"lying to her\" about the soup being vegetarian when it was \"clearly made with chicken stock\" - it wasn't, all their soups are vegetarian and gluten free to this day), I was tending to another table when one of the men whistled at me from across the room. \n\nNot a discreet raise of the hand or \"excuse me\", but a full on high pitched whistle as though he were beckoning his dog from across a field.\n\nThe restaurant hushes as everyone turns to stare at this guy and on the table beside this clown, my boss, the owner, who happened to be enjoying dinner with his boyfriend that evening and had been watching the antics of this table since they arrived, gently stands up and in front of the packed restaurant (and plenty of people who would know or have business with these arseholes), calmly tells them that his staff are not dogs and will not be treated as such. Then that the starters are on the house but they will not be served anything else this evening and are free to leave his restaurant.\n\nThey start mumbling apologies but he holds firm and the whistler starts shouting insults about a proper business man not turning away business on a Saturday night.

A while back she went out with some friends to a bar and got really drunk. The last thing she messaged me was \"I'm Sorry\", and I didn't hear from her for something like 5 hours. I freaked out a bit because I had no clue what had happened to her, as she hadn't been texting me much that night, and eventually decided to call it a night at about 5 AM my time (4 AM her time). As I was about to fall asleep she messaged me on Skype and called me and was extremely apologetic. I asked her what happened, and she told me that she was really drunk when she left the bar, and when she got home she puked a bunch and fell asleep in the bathroom. She was really upset and thought I was going to break up with her, but I assured her that I wasn't going to break up with her and that if I was upset, it was only because I was worried about her and didn't know what happened.\n\nNow this next part is what really got to me, somehow while talking to her the next day, the subject of flirting with people to get free drinks came up, and I asked her semi-jokingly if she flirted with guys the night before to get free drinks.

We told eachother that we loved one another and the works.\n\nShe assured me that she only did it for the drinks and wasn't actually flirting with any guys to start anything, and ended up denying the guys at the end of the night. But still, it hurt me a lot. I'm not sure if I should be hurt about it or not, but I was. Eventually I got over it, but tonight the thought came back into my head. \n\nIs this something that is normal to be upset about, or am I being really clingy?\nTL;DR:"}

At the time my peanut allergy was rated a 4 (out of six). When I was 16 I was re-tested, and I am not allergic to ALL legumes and tree nuts. My peanut allergy was a 5 out of 6 (91 kU/L). I had not gotten a skin test since I was five years old until two weeks ago. After the skin test there appeared to be no positives, but te blood test showed that things actually got worse: my peanut antibodies were >100 kU/L. My doctor wants to do a peanut-specific scratch test,but I am unsure, mainly because I don't really understand why we would do that or what the possible outcomes could be. I'm pretty upset already; the false negative was a pretty big let down.\nTL;DR:"}

He literally has no reason to offer other than \"I need to plan\".\n\nIt seems to me that if he actually wanted to marry me it wouldn't be this hard to get married. He quit his high paying job for a riskier venture within a week of deciding to, so he can certainly be decisive when he wants to.\n\nI'm having a hard time dealing with all my friends and family giving me those looks of pity and worry - like I'm pathetic enough to be with someone who I have to chase after so much.\n\nI feel like I'll be fine being single and meeting someone new to date and being 30 while that happened if I knew that the person wouldn't drag things out and want to date forever before making the decision to marry (can someone help me out with what I'm trying to articulate here?).\n\n**I guess I'm just asking for perspective.

She's repeatedly said she's thinking about transferring to a school in the Midwest. Is there anything I can do to convince her otherwise? Even from an objective standpoint, the school is inferior by nearly every available academic metric, and she was really taken by the fact that the seniors \"want to stay and keep taking classes instead of graduating\" unlike here where \"everyone wants to leave.\" On paper, our current school blows it the fuck out of the water and she'd be leaving behind plenty of friends and several other things and I just don't understand her logic. For example, the school she might transfer to has a 99% acceptance rate and a shit 4-year graduation rate/retention rate, whereas our current school is quickly on the rise and has decently high ratings IN US World and the like. She's also repeatedly said it's \"hard for her\" and she cares about me. \n\nAny ideas on what I should say/do?

But other than this, really, our relationship is amazing. This is the one thing that makes me unhappy. And I didn't want to be the guy who broke up with his girlfriend because he was the jealous type.

It's the big decision, where to go to school. We both want to go to university (specifically MUN in St. John's, Newfoundland), but the course (Computer Science) I want is considered an art down here. I'd be getting a Bachelor of Art, and I know that wouldn't look good on a resume, especially if I want a good job. I'm kind of stuck between going there and going to Western University in Ontario, which is a long distance away from her. Computer Science is considered a science there, so I'd get a Bachelor in Science which would be really helpful for me, career wise. I haven't brought it up to her in any way, this is just my own personal thoughts right now. Should I end it because long distance would never work with me and her, or should I see if she'd like to accompany me and possibly attend the same university as me? Or do I give up my possible career advantages to be with her? I do love her so.\nTL;DR:"}

They all experienced \"moments of clarity\" or some other reason that resulted in them breaking up in the end.\n\nI am just wondering if this is coincidence, or if others have experienced this.

I was never ugly but now I find that I a lot of women that I meet are into me and this was not really a regular thing in the past.\n\nThis is as a result of a combination of my confidence increasing, finding a style/look that really suits me, improving how I dress etc. I also moved country (UK->Spain) and seem to be seen as much more attractive here.

Don't get me wrong though - I have plenty of male friends, too.\n\nSo, what's the problem? Well, quite a few times recently I've made friends with a woman and then eventually realised that she actually wants to sleep with me. This makes me feel a bit uncomfortable and I don't really know how to handle it. I am in the process of coming out of a messy relationship and I am definitely not looking for anything.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by asking a girl out\nPOST: Backstory - So I've been talking to this girl for a few weeks now, and she just recently started showing signs of affection. She's been hugging me more and coming closer to me. I'd go do something and separate from the group of friends that I hang out with and she'd join me willingly. She'd smile at me and talk to me any chance she could. She made it pretty clear that she felt something for me, or so I thought. So finally yesterday I told myself that I'd just go up to her and kiss her. I was so extremely nervous. I had the perfect opportunity to do it, and I chickened out. Completely. I hated myself incredibly for the rest of the day. I woke up the next morning so determined to do what I was planning the previous day. I wasn't even nervous. I had it all layed out perfectly. The day goes by and by the end of it, I see her talking with some friends. It's now or never. I walk up to her and freeze up. Every drop of confidence fled my body so instantaneously fast, it was unbelievable. I say, \"[Jane], I like you, will you be my girlfriend?\" It was the most ridiculous thing that had ever left my mature mouth. Her friends start laughing and she turns as red as a tomato and just replies, \"I don't know, I need to think about it,\" which pretty much translates to a no. I felt like such an idiot. So stupid. I'm now seen as the weird ass kid by every person at my school. The weird, awkward, fuck up kid. This is the third time in a row that something of this sort. I get led on way too easily.\nTL;DR:"}

Me and my wife started dating in high school.  We dated for 5 years then got married about 5 years ago.  The marrage has been great for the last 5 years, but lately I have just had this weird gut feeling about the way she has been acting lately.\n\nMy wife cheated on me before we got married with a close friend of mine.  I forgave her, we worked through it and things have been good.\n\nOver the past couple weeks my wife has been texting, talking on facebook with a guy she meet at a group running event she attented.  I found the facebook messages and asked her why she is so obsessed with this guy lately.  Her reply was that he is just a friend and I have nothing to worry about.  She did ask me if I wanted her to completely cut off contact with this guy.  I told her it was not a fair question, because if I answer yes I look like a pathetic jealous husband, if I answer no I would be lying to myself.  \n\nI found out she went running with him alone last week as well.  She always gives me updates when she is running so I know she is safe.  I did not get any updates that night.  She said her phone had died thats why she did not send me any updates. \n\nSo what do I do here?  I really want to trust her and do not want to tell her who she can be friends with, but its really been eating me up inside lately.\nTL;DR:"}

People laugh at my jokes, this past week in particular was really, really fun for everyone, and they said so themselves. But it seems like whenever I text someone to see if they're doing anything, they're first \"not that busy\" or \"doing nothing at all\", but then once I ask if they want to go for a drink or a movie or hang out, it's \"Ah I should really be getting this thing done\" or \"I don't really feel like going out.\" Often, I've been finding, those same people go out later that day with other people from work. I know because they post pics all over snapchat or facebook.\n\nIf I ask in person, or suggest plans like, \"Hey, we should go try out that new restaurant around the corner\" or even just suggesting to go grab a coffee, I'm usually met with chuckles or \"Oh yeah that'd be fun\" but then have it never happen.\n\nI guess there must be something I'm missing socially, like a social cue or something. Maybe I'm only fun to be around at work for the 5-9 hours (depending on the shift) they see me? Maybe there's something people say about me that I don't know that makes my co-workers not want to be around me outside of work? Maybe it's just that they've got more going on in their lives than I do, and I just ask a little too often. I try to space out the amount of times I suggest plans by at least a week and a bit, but that could still be tiresome.\n\nI guess I'm just asking what I might need to change about myself so that co-workers and friends will want to hang out with me more.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by looking like a creeper.\nPOST: This happened just a few hours ago. It was dark. I had just gotten off work, and was dropping off my rent check. It's at a house that has been renovated into a small property management company. All the tenants drop their checks in the mail slot on the front porch. I pulled up in front of the sidewalk just in front of the house. Now I'm a repairman, so I drive a white service van with no windows. I sat there a few minutes and wrote out my check. Out the corner of my eye, I saw a car pull into the driveway, directly between me and the house. I thought nothing of it. Soon as i finished the check I got out of the van, and started walking quickly up to the house. I saw a woman on the dimly lit porch dropping her check in the slot. I waved at her to be friendly, since we'd be walking right by each other in a few moments. Midwave I realized this was not a woman, but a young girl. Like maybe 10 years old. At the same time she saw me and stopped dead in her tracks. I looked at the car to my right, and saw her father frantically waving her to the car. It was only then that i realized how this looked. A large man sitting in a windowless van at night, suddenly gets out and starts walking quickly towards a young girl, all the while waving. Now I'm not scary looking, but i can be physically intimidating. \n In a sudden panic I took the rent check out of my pocket and pointed at it, trying to signal to the father that I wasn't a threat. But he was too busy trying to get his daughter in the car to see me. So I just walked past and dropped my check in the box. Then got back in my van, feeling like an asshole for scaring a little girl. I'm sure he saw me drop the check in, and noticed that i was not in fact a kidnapper. But it still felt pretty shitty even for a moment.\nTL;DR:"}

Long time lurker here. I don't really do the whole ask the internet for help thing but I need some advice/help from people who are more experienced and I don't know where to turn. So here is my story. \n\nA few weeks ago I got an offer to fly to a state I have never been in before to go work as a sort of intern for a corporation in the northeastern US. At that time I had never flown by my self before nor had I been out of my state often or by my self. It was only supposed to last 2 weeks but they wanted me to come back for another 2(I am in my 3rd week here now) and after I fly back home next week, I will have to drive back up and continue working for a longer period of time. My problem is I have only lived in one state for my whole life and I have no idea about relocation or anything. I am getting help but things are moving abnormally fast(this was admitted to me by some one high up). I do not have a relocation package and I need to find a place to stay within a week. So I guess what I am asking is if anyone could point me in the right direction of housing in the area of Pittsburgh? On another note I would like to ask anyone who has corporate experience to offer insight as to how large corporations work and/or provide stories of experiences with those types of companies. I am not stupid I know its all politics, its not new to me, it is just my first time working for corporate America.\nTL;DR:"}

We started dating right as I left for college on the other side of the state, so it is a relatively long distance relationship. However, we are fortunate enough to see each other at least once every 2-3 weeks. \n\nWhen we started dating, I had just got out of a long and serious relationship. It ended badly but my SO is seriously my savior. I've never been happier in my life. But after all that happened in my past relationship, I'm just a little cautious with this one. I'd like to take things slow. \n\nMy SO really wants to meet my family however. I have met both his parents once. I come from a conservative Asian household and the whole dating and boyfriends thing isn't really a comfortable topic to talk about around the house. I have older two sisters though who have been through the whole thing but they have always dated Asian guys that my parents approve of.\n\nMy SO is white and I wouldn't say my parents are racists or anything, but I'm not sure how they would feel about that. If it were up to me, I'd wait a few more months but this means a lot to him. He is a great guy who is in school and about to train to be a firefighter. I know they will like him eventually.

I never expected to hear from him again which would have been fine with me. The next week I get an email from him. I was surprised to say the least.\n\nFast forward six months and we are talking daily and things have progressed past a friendly level. Then I find out he is legally married with kids. We didn't really discuss the details of his marriage but they weren't living together anymore so I assumed they were separated. I left it at that and didn't ask anymore questions.\n\nFast forward another six months and a couple visits to see each other and we've fallen in love. It was definitely the last thing either of us expected. Recently we went on a romantic weekend getaway and we ended up having a serious talk about his wife and kids. I found out that they aren't separated like I thought and I am slightly upset because I never wanted to do this to another woman. I probably would have made different choices had I known before we fell for each other that they weren't separated.\n\nHe is an amazing man and I couldn't imagine not having him in my life. We do realize the unrealistic nature of us being together for a few reasons and he encourages me to see other people. I do from time to time, but there aren't that many datable men where I live. I feel like the logical person in me knows that I should cut this off now and let him sort out his life and marriage while I work on meeting new people in my area to fall for. However the part of me that loves him just wants to ride this out. I have no expectations that things will change anytime soon and the only thing that really bothers me about that is the guilt I feel towards his wife.

When he has his bad days, he might hit her and text her nasty threats throughout the work day. She ends up crying at her desk and not being able to do her job. When he's not angry, she's happy and posting pictures of them \"in love\" on social media. It's a complete 180. She says she's been with him for a while and is used to his mood swings.\n\nAt first I would offer suggestions to help her out of that situation, and she would only give reasons why she can't leave him. I ended up as one of her only \"go-to\"s. It's really distracting me from my work now. More and more I will receive calls to listen to what he said next, get her things when I step out, drive her to/from work, even taking over her job so she can throw up from being so upset. Everyone at work knows when she's having a bad day, but she won't be fired because we are severely understaffed (and still somewhat does her job)\n\nI've started to make excuses to not get myself involved anymore, but since I see her every day, I still get the sob stories.

I got caught a couple times but it was never a big deal. My family was understanding and ultimately I don't think porn itself damaged my growth in any way. I don't really watch porn anymore and I have normal, healthy relationships with my peers including a couple monogamous sexual relationships over the past couple of years since I became sexually active.\n\nThat being said, I had numerous kinks when I watched porn, including incest fantasies. I liked to watch pornographic videos as well as read online erotic fiction about incest but it was **never** something I fantasized for myself or with my own family members. I was turned on by it, but only as an outside observer. And nowadays I am no more into incest fantasies than any other type of pornography.\n\nMy worry is, even though I never fantasized in this way, I feel extremely uncomfortable displaying physical signs of affection to my family. I'm talking, like, hugging. It *doesn't* arouse me but I definitely have a conscious but involuntary adverse reaction to physical contact with my family, to the point where they think of me as standoffish and unaffectionate.\n\nI care deeply for my family and I do my best to relay my feelings to them but it takes considerable effort for me to have even minimal physical contact with my family. I'll reiterate I don't have physical contact issues with any of my peers.\n\nIs there any advice anyone here can offer me? Is this just an issue because I'm still a hormonally-charged young man or is this something I'll have to get real therapy for? Is this a common issue/can anyone relate?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or encouragement you can share. It took a while to build the courage to type this but I really want to sort this out so I can show my family I appreciate them, and this is obviously not a topic I could easily share with friends or family.\nTL;DR:"}

It was none of my business, I should NEVER stick my nose in her life etc.  This was legitimately the very first fight we've ever had.\n\nI explained everything truthfully on text, told her why I did it etc.  She was still very angry with me and just didn't respond after she sent hateful texts.\n\nSo I have 2 questions. \n\n1.

She's blocked me from her life and so have her family and friends?\nTL;DR:"}

She told me I was \"cute\" but she \"doesn't want to mess things up with his current boyfriend\".\n\nNow, that \"boyfriend\" of hers treats her like sh*t and many people close to her also suggested her to break up with him, while I, being a good boy, didn't tell her nothing about that.\n\nSo you understand that their relationship is quite fragile.\n\nNow I don't want to be bad and do some trick in order to accelerate their breakup, I just want to get her to like me enough to understand that I can be a better boyfriend for her.\n\nI've already got her number and I want to start texting with her and see how things turn out.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/self\nTITLE: I recently cut off my 7 year friendship with my best friend. He was a sociopath. I've never felt better.\nPOST: Where can I start? I met this guy 7th grade and things were splendid. We had the exact same interests: videogames, music, comedy. We became super close and I trusted this guy with everything. He was a genius, nice to everyone he came across, yet always came off as cocky. There was never a moment he missed to prove he was superior to somebody. The closer we became the more we integrated into each other's group of friends. We soon began to have petty arguments and fight over stupid things. I could never win an argument against this guy. When I did win an argument providing proof of something I was correct the entire time, he would become angry (at times want to start a brawl) and not speak to me. He knew my empathy would then cause me to apologize and he took pleasure in the fact. Things took a turn for the worst when in high school he had sex with one of my ex-girlfriends. This did not bother me one bit to be honest, due to the fact this girl had cheated on me. (I was initially hurt but it's highschool so I got over it fairly quickly) I blew it off and actually bro'd out with him about it, but then began to see his true colors. There was a point where he caught me having a casual conversation with his girlfriend (we were in high school marching band) and he was not going to let that pass. He literally turned our friends against me for about a solid week until I apologized and thoroughly explained what happened; again my empathy kicking in. I inherently thought the whole thing was my fault, similar to many other arguments we had had in the past; it was ALWAYS my fault. \n\nFast forward a couple of years. I'm 20 now and we went to different colleges but still texted everyday, played Xbox online on the weekends and went to concerts and hung out during holidays. Somehow through all this disconnection he would still manage to undermine me in more ways than one. (We both began working out at uni so you can see how that went) Until one late day, I learned what a sociopath was and discovered how to deal with one.\n\nStep 1) Cut off all contact.\nTL;DR:"}

It is about 5 stories up and 2 down. Do you have a picture of how big it is? Well there is only one exit and we require payed parking, the first hour is a tiny sum of 1.50$ and then on it gets much bigger, we give time stamped tickets in an automated fashion. Well one day I am simply working and have over 80 cars trying to exit at once, it is a big line and takes me over 30 minutes to get everyone out since I have to validate the ticket and take the money, while most insist on paying with cash. Fast forward the last car is coming up and it is some middle age woman with a real bitchy attitude and gives me a lot of shit, I don't want to type the foul words and accusations towards my sexuality she said. I then asked for her ticket after letting her rant, she looked around in her purse and the look on her face as it dropped was AMAZING! She lost the ticket, and which is explain on a huge red sign that loss of the ticket is equal to paying the maximum amount of time we allow before you get your car towed, which is 3 months. Now my supervisor clearly told me if a customer lost the ticket and I made a judgment call I could have them pay the price of 7 days instead of the full 3 months, however I have to truly believe the person with the time table and etc... Well because of her bitch attitude I charged her for 3 months on a trip she said was only 5 days long. 7 day = 17.50 $ 3 months = 200$.\nTL;DR:"}

Driving through a wooded section of road I had seen several deer standing beside the road and was keeping any eye out for them. They were easy to spot because of the tan color. Coming around a turn I saw a huge mass suddenly appear in front of my headlights. It was a huge moose with a full rack. What I remember from that point was like a slide show with associated thoughts. \n\nSlide 1 Moose running in front car and trying to turn around. My thought process, Oh Crap that's a moose!\n\nSlide 2 Hitting brakes. My thoughts included the realization that I am going to hit this moose, quickly remembering that I have seen on mythbusters what happens when a car hits a moose.\n\nSlide 3 Hitting the moose in the back legs it sits down on the hood of car and rolls towards me. This is the moment I remember thinking, \"so this is how I die, I never would have guessed' and remember praying that my body would stop the moose before it hit my kids in the back seat.\n\nSlide 4 Moose hits windshield and fills my view. No my life did not flash before my eyes, but I do remember thinking or feeling that I was ok with what I had done with my life, no regrets.\n\nSlide 5 The windshield is cracked but held together and the moose has rolled up on to the roof. At that point my only thought was \"huh\", because I did not expect to still be alive or at least not have a moose in my lap.\n\nLater on when I was having the windshield replaced I was told that the original windshield had been installed wrong and the only thing holding it in was the weight of the glass and air pressure.\n\nThe biggest thing I learned from the moose, is that at any moment our lives can come to an end. You may not have tomorrow, the only time you are guaranteed is the moment you have now. Everyone should have a moose moment it will really change your perception of things.\nTL;DR:"}

Been completely honest since the beginning, and she knows exactly how I feel about her. She's really really really freaking beautiful which is great for me but also means that like 10 other guys like her. Anyways after a couple months of texting we finally meet at one of her friend's pool parties. Before the party I thought I really had a shot with her, texting every day, she was finally being flirty back, etc. We basically talked the whole party (well, me and a guy friend and her and her friend) but I was talking to her the whole time. I wasn't quite as flirty in person as I wanted to be, mainly because of the other people there. After the party something changed. I'm normally a jealous guy, and one of those annoying guys who freaks out when someone doesn't answer a text (I'm improving on that I swear!) All of her friends and her have told me I'm a nice enough and nice enough looking guy, she just said she isn't feeling up to a bf right now. That's a legit excuse, she's not just letting me down easy. After the party though, she stopped texting me as quick. She wouldn't answer whenever I would bring up us hanging out again (not going out, hanging out.) It seemed the only time I could get her to answer would be whenever I would ask her a question about herself or when I would tell her something personal. We weren't texting nearly as often or flirty, and recently she's just stopped answering all together. I've decided to give it a break and not text her for a bit but I really just want things to get back to the way they were.

This has been working out fine, but I have a history of severe depression and recently it has kicked in hard. Weight is not the only factor there, but my mental state has been effecting my work and my life for a few weeks and I want to do something drastic to improve myself. The last time this hit me, I started doing keto and it worked amazingly for my mental health and physical health (down from 330lbs).\n\nI have a pretty flexible job schedule and I had this idea to take off a month of work in September and focus on my physical health. By \"going all-out\", I mean spending the majority of the month training to get in physical shape and doubling-down on the strictness of my diet (counting macros and doing the math stuff that I normally don't do). I haven't really utilized exercise in my weight-loss plans yet on account of my size, but that is starting to feel like a lame excuse that is holding me back.\n\nIf I really spent a month working out as much as I could, what could I really accomplish? I feel like it should be results I can see, even though obviously I'm not going to look like Brad Pitt in Fight Club after 30 days. If I do this, I was planning to focus heavily on cardio a few times per day and do strength training. \n\nAll of this stuff is new to me, so I'm coming here for advice. I know this sounds extreme and possibly dangerous because of my size (I'm a 5'10\" male if that gives context to my weight), but it feels like something that could save my mental state and kick-start an interest in working out normally.\n\nAny advice on what I should focus on, or how to approach this- or even reasons why it's a bad idea- would be greatly appreciated.

Granted there are varying levels of how it goes, but today was probably the worst so far. It started innocently enough, \"Would you wanna move here? To Cleveland? Where would you wanna go?\" but every time I try and explain myself she chocks it up to her \"wanting it more than I do\" which pisses me off because to me it basically translates to her loving me more than i love her. In a sense I understand where she's coming from, and I'd love it if we were closer, but regardless of distance I do not make enough money, and am not ready to leave all my family and friends behind. I'm worried though that she will never be fully happy until it changes. I'm also secretly afraid it'll ultimately be the end of us\nTL;DR:"}

They had to get an exact number from a director within the company and told me they would get back to me. I spoke with hr twice Monday, first time I told them I just wanted to know how much because I would be commuting and the second time I called back to tell them I know they have to come back with an exact number but I had my mind set on working for the company for the summer. I asked how the process works as I have never had an internship before and was told they would have to send me an official offer letter when they get an exact number from the director which should have only been a day or two.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: [34/m] I found my boyfriend's [27/m] profile on a hookup app\nPOST: Backstory: We've been together for 4 years, recently moved in together and things are mostly fine. Our sex has decreased significantly in the past year, but I assumed this was normal. He's gained some weight, is a little on the heavy side. (I admit this has had an impact on my attraction to him.)\n\nAnyway. I was browsing a hookup app. (I'm not saying I'm a good person either - this isn't the point of this post.) I was mostly just seeing what was out there, maybe flirt a little. Mostly because I was bored and horny. No real plans to cheat. \n\nAnd then I see his picture. Which probably means he saw mine.\n\nBut here's the thing - I was being anonymous and only posted a torso pic. About chin to hips. His pic was of his face. So while I was able to recognize his pic, I'm not certain that he was able to recognize mine. \n\nI deleted the app. Never met anyone. Never told my boyfriend (as it would incriminate me also.) \n\nNow I'm in this state of realization that our relationship is shitty, or we're both wanting to hook up with other people. \n\nHere's my question: I'm actually totally okay with him seeing other people. I understand that he got into this relationship young and that I am his first and only boyfriend, and he may feel the need to \"play the field\" a little before settling down with one person. I feel the same myself. I'm a believer in non-monogamous relationships. I feel like sometimes the best relationships are open or semi-open, to allow for some fun but not kill the relationship dead. (Yes, I'm a listener of Dan Savage.)\n\nMy question is: how do I bring this up to my boyfriend? Do I ask if he wants an open relationship, or do I accept that maybe we're doomed together? (He continues to say he loves me every day, so I believe he just wants to have fun with others.) Maybe this is a non-question and I'm just talking to myself. \n\nAnyone have any experiences similar to this?\nTL;DR:"}

We've been friends for around 3-4 years and it's only recently that we got pretty close. I'm pretty sure I don't like her on a bf/gf level but I do enjoy every moment spent with her and chatting about random crap.\n\nIn the past, I've had a habit of cutting these kind of friends off when I get too close since things can get complicated. I really don't want to keep up this habit but I can't think of any other way to stay as good friends with this girl without having her on my mind all the time (you know how the mind tends to wander into places we don't want to venture). We text/talk all the time and she's always the one who initiates the conversation so the advice \"maybe you should stop talking to her\" can't apply here. Even when I'm at work or hanging out with my other friends, I can't help but to think \"I wonder what she's doing now\" or \"When is she gonna text me again?\".\n\nI know it might not necessarily be a bad thing to have someone on your mind all the time but our interactions as of late have kept her on mind more often than it should and since we're just friends, this really  has to stop.\nTL;DR:"}

He's a great guy but he really is a pushover when it comes to his friends, his parents, and even myself. Sometimes it's little things, like we ALWAYS eat whatever I want, or watch whatever I want, even when I'm like... \"No really, you pick!\" Sometimes it's bigger things like his business partner/friend will not show up anytime he wants because he knows my boyfriend will pick up his slack and not even be mad about it. \n\nHe also avoids confrontation like is the plague. Even things he think will be confrontational, he'll avoid. For example, he runs a small business and that means every now and then he'll have to skip pay or lend his business his own money, we'll one time I volunteered to help out with the expectation of getting paid back within a week or so. He doesn't handle the finances, so I'd ask him if his partner was able to get me back yet... he'd keep saying I don't think so, etc... A few months later I got a little fed up and emailed his partner about it and be says \"Yeah! We've had it, I just forgot! Wish (your boyfriend) would've just said something!\"\n\nIt can cause problems too. Like if his parents tell him he should do something one way and unbeknownst to me I say we should do something another way... he'll end up either just not doing whatever it is either way or he'll actually lie to either me or his parents saying he did it the way whichever of us suggested.\n\nBecause of this it's really hard to confront him because he'll just say \"I know.\" Or \"Yeah, I should've done that..\" or \"yeah that's what I'll do...\" just immediately admitting fault and saying he'll change whatever it is.\nTL;DR:"}

Even if I greet her and try to talk to her, she'll pretend I'm just not there.\n\n* She'll sit there and brood quietly. If I ask her what's wrong, she won't tell me. (I've also tried rephrasing this to 'tell me what's on your mind'. Still nothing)\n\n* She hates being late for her plans, but if we're late for any of my plans because she was slow to get ready, she doesn't empathize one bit. (Sometimes I feel like she's purposefully wasting time).\n\nBasically if I'm upset, I believe that no matter what, I should show her love, because I love her no matter what! And I do show her love!

It worked all right--the occasional pimple here and there.\nA friend told me that I was overdoing it, that I was creating the problems I was trying to fix--that the benzol peroxide may be killing bacteria, but also drying out my face, which caused my skin to produce more oil.  She told me to stop all that, and maybe I'd break out, but then I'd clear up again, after my skin got used to not being dried out every day.\n\nSo I decided to experiment, and stopped doing all that crap--washing only with an apricot scrub.  For two weeks, my skin was doing fine.  Great, in fact--completely clear--better than before.\nAnd then: BREAKOUT.  It's geting worse and worse each day now, big, red ones spreading around my mouth.  It's crippling my self-confidence and driving me crazy.  My instincts tell me to go back to the routinized treatment.  I mean I guess I was expecting a breakout?

We are quite in love with each other and are committed to a long-term relationship. Things are mostly good between us, but now and then there's a communication issue. This issue is that we'll be talking throughout the day, and suddenly she goes radio silent and I won't hear from her for the rest of the day. I won't know why, and I won't know if I'll be talking to her again that day. Usually it turns out that something came up that took up the rest of her day.\n\nNow let me say right off the bat, I have absolutely no problem with her doing whatever she wants. While I love spending time with her, I completely respect her space and have no demands on her time. As it is, we talk quite a lot and I feel very fortunate for that. My problem here is that she doesn't communicate to me at all that she's going to stop talking to me and go off and do something else. I feel like it's not that much to ask that she send me a quick text just to let me know she'll be gone for the rest of the day. \n\nI'm not sure if even that's being too controlling of me though? She's definitely sensitive to even the slightest control being put on her life, and has said she doesn't want to feel like she has to answer to someone about what she's doing. But that's not what I'm asking for, I really just want to know if I'm going to be seeing her later that day or not. \n\nSo, am I going overboard and should I just accept it when she disappears for the day without a word? Or am I at least a little justified in wanting a little more communication from her? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I don't know why, but I felt compelled to tell her how I felt so I hit up this kid I knew from grammar school and asked for her number. He wouldn't give it to me because he's not comfortable with giving out other people's numbers without permission. So he gave her my number. She hit me up at around 9:00 with a \"hey\". So I texted her \"I need to say one thing so I'm going to call you real quick if you can't answer I'll leave a voicemail.it'd be too long to type.\" She didn't answer so I left a voicemail. I explained I'm reinventing myself. I've lost 50 lbs, and am very fit now, I only wear glasses for reading, I have braces, I am confident to a fault, and I'm working on my regrets. Never telling her how I felt was a regret so I changed that. After telling her all this I hung up, texted her \"Ik this is random as, but I just needed to do this.

I just adopted this [gorgeous fella] this past Saturday. He's a total sweetheart and big old mush who has probably had a pretty rough go of things. We are really trying to do the [two week shutdown] but discovered he has some serious anxiety. He escaped our last cage twice before we reinforced it with zip ties.

We have done LOTS of treats in the crate (including a hardy chew bone filled with frozen peanut butter) and he goes in fine. Once he's in and the door is closed, he panics. He ripped the tray of the last crate up in only minutes while we were still in the apartment. I wonder if his several successful escapes have encouraged him to thrash about in there like he does, but who knows. He has [some marks on his nose] that might be scars from who knows what happened to him (he was found in Trenton).\n\nToday we tried a new tactic because I didn't want him to impale himself on metal while I was at work. When he escaped the first two times, he didn't destroy anything, so I left him isolated in the bedroom with his crate open and lots of treats after a big walk.

She did tell me that if we talked about it sooner it could have been avoided. I have spent all the time since then thinking back about what I could have done better and how easily I could fix this if she would let me, but I am afraid to try to get ahold of her. \n\nShould I try to talk to her, or should I just accept this and try to move on? She says she still loves me, and I know I still love her, but I do not want to make this situation any worse for either of us if I am wrong about it being salvageable.\nTL;DR:"}

She's actually my first girlfriend too, and breaking up with someone is still completely new to me, so here goes:\n\nWe've never had sex.  I keep bringing this up with her and she always says that she's too shy/not in the mood.  When we start with foreplay, it lasts a good 10 minutes and I never get anything out of it.  I believed she would change eventually, but after one and a half years, I'm starting to get pretty upset about it.\n\nOver the past months, she's been always \"too tired\" or \"not in the mood\" to do anything.  Go out with friends, have a good time, etc.  She always just wants to watch a movie, and goes to bed 20 minites in.  I'm getting tired of always sitting around doing nothing.  When she does decide to go out and do stuff, she seems to always find a reason to bitch at me (\"You're so annoying\", \"you're too drunk\", etc.).\n\nI met this other girl a couple of months ago who started getting my interest, which I've shrugged up until now.  However, I'm starting to get tired of all this and the attention I'm getting from this girl that I haven't gotten from my gf is really starting to have me re-evaluate my situation.  I ended up confessing this to my girlfriend and I told her I had to make my mind up about things, and we're on break for a bit now.\n\nI mean, even with all the negativity, I do still like hanging out with my current girl friend; except the lack of sex + lack of fun is really starting to take a toll on me, and I'm not sure what I want anymore.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Should I take my final exams?\nPOST: The high school I go to allows you to opt out of taking final exams for AP or advanced-level classes if you have at least an 81 average. You have to turn one form in, and then you're free to go. It shows up as \"Exempt\" on your transcript, and you just get the sum of the three grading periods of the semester. The catch is, if you take the final, even if you're exempt, you get what you get. You could have all 100s for the grading periods, get a 0 on the final, and end up with a 75 average.\n\nRight now, I'm taking all advanced or AP classes (AP History, Calculus, English, and Advanced Physics). As of now, they show us the average of our three grading periods for a class. I'm mainly wondering about Physics, where I'm getting an average of 84 so far, and English, where I'm getting an 85.\n\nThe way I figure it, you have to get at least a pre-test average of 88 to even have a chance of bumping it up to an A, since >= 91 is an A and (88*3)=264. 264+100=364. 364/4=91.

We both left a negative situation and were looking for something serious. We were like minded in the sense that becomming a parent was very important, as well as getting married and being relatively young parents. There was a general timeline of how we wanted everything to pan out.\n\nNow we've made many compromises. He changed his mind about marriage, but it was still my dream, so it's been decided that we get engaged, and have a small wedding (like 30 people-dinner-small party), but not legally-no papers. No public schooling, but instead homeschool (his idea) where I'm leaning more towards alternative schools so they can still socialize and learn skills they otherwise wouldn't learn at home. But then, we talked about vaccinations, and that's where everything came to a shuttering hault.\n\nHe doesn't believe in vaccinations at all. No question. There is no way to change his mind. Now I haven't done enough research to choose what I believe in, but right now I'm pro vaccine. If I stick with that choice, we're basically breaking up. I find this very frustrating because the pressure is on me. Either I sacrifice my beliefs to have a family with him, or stand my ground and find someone that would be as supportive, patient and loyal he is to me. I don't know what to do or how to deal with this.\n\nI'm really just getting ahead of myself now, but I'm realizing how important certain questions or conversations are before getting married or even getting into a serious realtionship.\nTL;DR:"}

My fiance and I thought it would be a good idea that I would move back home while he is deployed for a year starting in February of 2013.\nHe is gone quite often for training exercises, weeks to months at a time. So recently, I decided to do a month stint at my parent's home to see how well we would \"mesh\" together. Also keep in mind that my father is former Marine, and my fiance is currently in the Army. Sadly, the debate of which branch is better does stir up some tension, mainly with my father. All too often it comes down to lack of respect and misunderstanding between each branch, and lack of importance to what my fiance and myself deal with from time to time. (Late nights, early mornings, you get my point)\n\nAnyhow, During this past month... I have been judged. (How I could possibly marry a soldier) to \"You should spend his paycheck while he is away, he won't use it anyway\", to \"You should give me 800 in rent every month since his paycheck is just sitting there\". My mother becomes habitually drunk every night, hashing out digs at my personality, to saying my fiance doesn't do enough for me. You get the idea. \n\nMy fiance and my parents do not get along all that often, stubborn people clash. My fiance feels I should not be alone during this time of him being away, and that I need a good support system in the mean time. Even though they do not get along, he loves my parents... he respects them, but do not like being around them.\n\nWe have discussed the option of getting married before he deploys, and getting a separate home so I can study, work, etc and it is completely taken care of, while seeing my parents whenever I see fit. I have issues (presently) with anxiety, possibly undiagnosed panic disorder, so its another reason he feels I need people around often.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25F] with my parents [50s M/F]. Need perspective on communication between child and parent.. (Non-Romantic)\nPOST: I don't wish to go into loads of details about the problems in my family(parents, me and two sisters (22 and 27)), they are pretty standard I think, but in general we talk a lot and see each other often. All us girls are living on our own, though not too far from parents. Our parents help us a lot and have been great at pushing us to be independant and find our own happiness.\n\nLately my parents are having some issues.. They seem to be marital problems, but I believe them to be much deeper personal problems they both are having, and constantly recommend therapy and/or couples counseling. This doesn't really interest them much so onto the real issue.\n\nMy parents occasionally talk to me about the issues, and I provide my mother comfort sometimes if she is angry or sad and can't muster much besides complaints. I really like that I can be there for her and let her vent and talk. I want to provide comfort and be involved. I also like that my dad shares his side with me sometimes, although I am a little tough on him, because I don't believe he has been the best husband over the years. But I never berate or accuse him, I just try to listen a lot. \n\nThe problem is that my father grew up as being leaned on by his mother when she was having issues with his dad. This was when my dad was quite young, and though he adores his mother, he resents parents who lean on their kids for support. Now I understand this, but I think it should only apply to young or immature children, or kids who have too many of their own problems. I feel like I can easily be there for them as they are there for me now.. Is this unrealistic? Should parents hide their marriage and personal problems from the kids to shield them of guilt/worry? I do worry about them, but I don't feel like I shouldn't be concerned and involved in their lives this way.. I love them and only want them to be happy.. I am sad my mother tells me she doesn't want to worry me and apologizes for telling me her troubles..\nTL;DR:"}

Reddit, what is your best fast food experience?\nPOST: I was driving through McDonalds with my girlfriend after dinner because we were both in the mood for a McFlurry and it was hot as balls out. We get through the line and the nice middle aged lady behind the glass spends about a minute and a half talking to a co-worker while our McFlurrys just sit on the counter, slowly becoming soup. Finally, she notices us, turns back to her co-worker for about 15 more seconds and finally hands up our tasty treats. Before I can grab them, she snatches them away and says \"You can't have these\" clearly in a joking manner. So I look down and simply said \"Please?\" and she starts laughing and hands them over. I had the small to my girlfriend and I get the regular size one. She says \"Now how come she has to have the small one, and you get the big one? HUH?\" and I say \"Because I'm giving her the big one later.\" Her eyes get huge and she is stunned for a few seconds and says \"We don't talk like that around here\" All I do is smile a huge, creepy smile and pull away slowly. I could hear her laughing after we pulled away. Made my night.\n\nSo Reddit, what is your best fast food experience?\nTL;DR:"}

They were hooking up for a couple months, nothing serious. I don't know if they really talk any more. In any case, he's become one of my closest friends. Mind you, I don't have many.

This program is very demanding (basically equal to taking 8 university level courses simultaneously), and is very important to me. Because 99% of what I am learning will be directly relevant to my future career, I am devoting a great deal of my time to understanding the material and completing all my course work.\n\nThe catch, is that I have been dealing with on and off again depression since my relatively traumatic childhood (long story) and the great deal of stress school is causing sort of exacerbates this. In the past I have used medications to control my mood, but for the fast few years (since me and my GF have been together), I have been off meds. \n\nTo cut to the chase, my mood is dropping, school work is piling up, and my girlfriend is getting angry that I am \"always in a bad mood\" and not able to spend much quality time with her. I don't dispute this...I am extremely stressed and busy and as a result not a whole lot of fun to be around. To add another layer to this, we live together and she is supporting me while I go to school, which makes me feel extra guilty for not being able to devote more time to her. Oh, and the cherry on top is that my libido is dropping like a rock and as a result we only have sex once every three weeks or so.\n\nWe nearly broke up today after a big fight about my low mood, but she decided to stay with her parents for a week to think things over. I feel like my mood is spiraling out of control...these fights are making it impossible to concentrate on the ever-growing pile of work I have, Im losing motivation and starting to feel like breaking up will be best for her. I feel like shit for not being able to give her what she needs, but Ive never had to deal with so many competing demands and the stress ia really getting to me.\n\nAny advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I'd love to go back into education but I don't know what I could do; I've used up a lot of my allotted government funded Student Finance (and also didn't get very good results in my A Levels) and so probably will not be able to go back to university, and I'm scared to try another part time course.\nTL;DR:"}

M30 & F33 Married 5 Years.\nPOST: There are a lot of things I could talk about and would like advice on...but mostly I already know what their answers are, I'm just not ready to accept it yet I suppose...\n\nSo, my only question is about our sexless marriage.  It's as bad as it gets in that department.  We didn't even consummate the day we were married, or even that month or longer.  Maybe once per year since then.  There is no passion, and when I ask about it, it gets ugly.  She refuses, acts like it's a huge inconvenience...doesn't show desire.  Forces me to 'plan' it and give her notice.  \n\nSo, on to my question.  She says it is because she wasn't raised with affection so for her, being cold is normal.  It's just the way she is, she says.   There was a time when we were wild in bed, so this isn't entirely true in my opinion.\n\nIs this a legitimate reason for her to deny me?  Lately, I have been getting in insane shape and I want to be intimate.  I find myself seriously considering cheating, and divorce.  I need someone to show me affection, and I can't be married to someone who refuses to understand my needs...\n\nAm I being fair?    I should probably say that I have become less and less attracted to her as time goes on.  She is letting herself go a little, plus it's hard to feel attracted to someone who doesn't reciprocate, for me anyway.\nTL;DR:"}

I could understand that.  Or, \"eat sweets to help curb cravings.\" Cool deal.  However, I am now incredibly depressed, lethargic, and my self esteem is shot.

He's my first and I've never had any sexual experience before dating him. We took a little break from May - July because we didn't see each other over summer. I don't know if this is normal, but sometimes I get excessively paranoid that I'm pregnant. I'm on the combo birth control pills and he uses condoms. There was one occasion where we were both really horny but we had no condoms, so he penetrated me but withdrew way before ejaculating. However I got really freaked out after that and we both agreed that it simply wasn't good for my anxiety. Because of my anxiety, I'm usually very good at taking the pill. I usually take it on time, or at most within a 3 hour window. There was one time where I fell asleep and forgot to take it, but I took it 9 hours later.\nHeck, I'm still really paranoid now that I'm pregnant now even after getting all of my withdrawal bleeds on time. This is kind of affecting our sex life because I've become slightly more hesitant during sex, and I also initiate a lot less. How can I overcome my excessive fear? Is this paranoia even normal?\nTL;DR:"}

It is broken into four different apartments, but still has a very house feel to it. I am living on the top floor and I need to walk up the stairs past the second floor apartment on a daily basis. \n\nA few weeks after moving in, I realized that the door to the second floor apartment blocks my egress when open. Essentially, when fully open it reaches the handrail and blocks movement up or down the staircase. I called the landlord and asked for the hinges to be moved on the door, so that it would no longer be an issue (so that it would open onto the wall rather than the handrail). The landlord told me that they had passed fire inspection and were not going to change anything for me. \n\nAccording to [this website] section 1005.2 states the the door shall not project more than 7 inches (178 mm) into the required width. There is an exception to this rule for group R-2 and group R-3, but I'm not sure how this applies.\n\nI was wondering, if anyone knew more information about NYS building code, could advise me in the situation. I think it could be really dangerous and want the hinges moved.\nTL;DR:"}

Luckily I don't really drink (went 10 years w/out touching a drop... now drink in moderation) so I haven't completely destroyed my brain/body, but still... I shudder to think how much money I've spent on it in my life - but would have wasted on other crap instead, anyway. I am amazed at how much I love to get high even to this day. I'm concerned that my chest/lungs hurt rather often (after smoking but still more than they ever have in the past) I'm concerned my brain can't take it anymore. I've gotten dumber but from what I understand that's perfectly understandable based on normal aging and the associated mental decline that accompanies it.

We're talking less than a joint a day. I'm not a heavy smoker - I do a bong hit or two every hour or so over the course of an evening. I end up going through about a quarter of mid-grade pot per week. My throat hurts. All I do is sit at home and smoke pot and hang out with my cats.

They have slept together previously multiple times, and she and his family are very close. Though they are not \"together\" and aren't engaged in a physical relationship currently (according to her), they are very close to each other, spend a lot of time with each other, and for all intents and purposes, both of their families think they are perfect together.\n\n3) We are very attracted to each other, and she says that I am everything that she wants in a guy. However, she is reluctant to enter an official relationship with me because she does not want to disappoint her best friend, his family, and her family.\n\n4) With school ending and me graduating, I will be going home for the summer. Then, in the fall, we will be at separate institutions, although I can commute every few weeks. In the spring she is going for a study abroad in South America, so we won't even have the opportunity to see each other for six months.\n\nConsidering all this, I know that it would be very difficult to continue on.

We met at summer school a couple years ago and now we go to the same University and we're in the same program. Over the last few weeks (since it's Fall exam time) she's asked me to study together and we have and we've been literally seeing each other every day for hours on end. (She asks me to study just as much as I ask her so it's reciprocated.) \n\nNow, I have feelings for her, we've talked about past lovers to each other - we've both asked each other about availability - but neither of us has stated anything specific toward each other. We hang out a lot and I value her friendship, but I'd like for it to be something more. I think she may as well, but I'm not certain so I'm hesitant. \n\nRegardless, these are my conundrums. Since we've been friends for so long I've been told that I shouldn't just ask her out on a date, I should take it slow - what do all of you think about this? Also, Do you think the fact that we always make time to hang out and that she's asked about by recent crushes, past lovers and whatnot shows, at least, some sign of interest? \n\nWhat do you think?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm a father of 2 and married and pretty much every single time I have started to work out I always quit a few weeks, month or two later. Last time I decided to to the Insanity program but I injured my back around september last year and haven't worked out since. I see all these fucking EX-fat asses that had the courage and will power to keep pushing and now they're normal healthy people and I just can't even fucking keep working out for more than a month or two. I know I need to be in better shape for my kids, I haven't really found anything I find \"fun\". Also because of my schedule i'm really fucking limited, oh i'm also a poor fuck. So all those fancy low carb and low fat diets are beyond reach from my wallet.  I usually just eat at work, which is usually something greasy and shit because I really can't afford much else. Are there like diets for poor people? Have any of you actually got fit/healthier without having to drastically change your diet and just worked out? I am trying to eat smaller portions and choose the healthier options.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Does she [23/F] still want anything to do with me [22/M]?\nPOST: *throwaway to protect the identities of those involved*\n\nSo a while ago I met a girl via Okcupid. After exchanging some messages we agreed to meet in person. So far so good, the date went well and we spent a good couple of hours hanging out with each other. Long enough for me to realize that I liked this girl.\n\nSo the next couple of days we texted a bunch and I think after about week and a half I asked her out to dinner. This is where things get complicated. She had gotten out of a pretty serious relationship not too long ago and from what I gathered the break-up wasn't good. So she wasn't really sure if she was ready to date yet.\n\nThe problem was that she felt I was coming on too strong. Which, admittedly, I probably was. After about a week of silence she decided she wasn't ready (\"I really like you, but I can't do this right now\") and as far as I was concerned that was it.\n\nAbout a month later she texted out of the blue asking how I was etc. There might have been some alcohol involved. We texted a bit that night and the next day I tried to re initiate the contact but she said just wanted to have a chat. Which was fine and we didn't go any further.\n\nFast forward a couple months. I have since moved to another city not too far away. Last weekend when visiting my parents I saw she had been online recently on Okcupid. So I texted her asking how she was, exchanged a few messages before she had to leave (it was Saturday).\n\nNow I still like this girl and would like to get back to chatting a bit and maybe eventually try another date. My question is whether I should give it another shot, or have I missed my chance? A detail that might be relevant, she is quite private/introverted.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/cats\nTITLE: A personality/temperament question for those who have pedigree cats\nPOST: I hope this doesn't get buried under all the cat pictures...\n\nOkay, a bit of a story first. I have two cats, one solid white DSH, Pangur Ban, and a pedigree, show-bred Maine Coon named Navi. I adore my cats, both of them, for their completely different personalities and attributes. I got Pangur at 10 weeks - she was hit by a car and catapulted face first into a fence, survived with minor scratches, and is a perfectly healthy albeit pudgy two year old cat. Navi was a graduation gift from a breeder, I didn't get a pick of kitten, she was four months old, but she was sweet and beautiful and I had always wanted a MC, so I was happy. \n\nPangur is tough. She's always stood up for herself, shown any aggressive animal (dog) what for, and the one time she was truly attacked by a dog, she left that dog with so many facial scars he looks like hid face went in a blender. Navi has always been a push over - she lets Pangur beat her up when they play, and the most protest she puts up when the puppy nose punches and fleas her is to meow and sometimes hiss. I've never seen her use her claws, though she has lion paws and I know she could do damage.\n\nLast Thursday, Navi was attacked. The dog had no cuts, and the vet said her wounds looked like she had been grabbed by the tail and pulled out from under something. From the destruction in the house, she was chased around for some time. She is alive, but had to have her tail amputated. \n\nNow for the reason I am here - have any of you cat owners with pedigree, show-bred cats seen a lack of aggression or self-preservation in your cats? I have never known a cat to not defend itself like Navi, and I'm wondering if it's because she has had all aggression bred out of her. I feel so horrible that my sweet cat has been hurt so badly, but I can't help but wonder why she didn't defend herself more, like Pangur does.\n\nAny ideas?\nTL;DR:"}

I have work for this restuarant for going on 5 years. Recently the majority of my fellow employees quit. This includes managers, bartenders, kitchen staff, servers, etc. I am the longest lasting employee there. I have always made friends there with no problem. We used to go out drinking etc. I have even named one former employee as my godmother for my baby arriving later this year! Earlier this year, they have shouldered me with a lot of responsibility. Training EVERYONE who comes through the door. Running store errands. Redoing menus, Service manuals, long 14 hour shifts etc. I do what I can for the store. A few months ago I found out I was pregnant and cut my availability in half. I do not work nearly as,much as I used to but I still work more than a lot of people there. They sneak in shifts and I tell them no, I can not do it. They tell me they have to do what is better for the restuarant. I am afraid that they are trying to pressure me or guilt me into taking the work load when I do not feel comfortable doing so. Today, when I asked to not be scheduled for the long closing shifts as frequently they steered the conversation to if I still talk to former employees as they heard I had lunch with one a few weeks ago. I confirmed and they told me that they could not ttolerate the chance that I may say something to them (ex employees) about the store. And even though I haven't done or said anything inappropriate yet, I might and get myself into trouble. This has n0t been an issue before and I am very unnerved by it. They told me if I have the need to talk that I can talk to some friends who are unfamiliar with my wwork, my fiance at home, or to them. I was pretty flabergasterd about the conversation and admittedly did not stand up for myself the way I feel I should have. I am afraid of getting fired for some thing so SILLY after so long and am afraid of looking for another job as a pregnant woman. Any advice will be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

Unfortunately this seems to define our relationship's dynamic, and now she is very submissive to me. She often makes personalized gifts for me, and I like that she cares and thinks about me, but it feels like I'm on the receiving end of a somewhat obsessive relationship. \n\nWe have our personality differences.

We were long distance then too... eventually I had to let it go. \n\nWe reconnected this past summer... are now having a long distance relationship again, but this time I am trying to be way more communicative (something I avoided last time) and I am trying to encourage him to seek help (he's at least aware he's not completely healthy mentally). \n\nMeanwhile, I am planning on going into the Peace Corps in a couple years... ideally, he'd spend some time while I was away working on his health and he and I could revisit our feelings once I returned... in the meantime, we both want to try to come up with a way to live closer to one another. \n\nMy concern is this... if he were to move out here, who's to say his mental state won't deteriorate? He's got a routine where he lives between his hobbies, work, chruch, and family that he wouldn't be able to replicate out here quickly. I would feel MUCH more comfortable if he had some sort of therapy he was working on to keep him balanced.\n\nIt was very painful for us both back 12 years ago when the shit hit the fan. I REALLY do not want a repeat of that. However, he and I partaking in a long distance relationship for the next many months or years without some sort of plan for moving close to one one another feels like nothing but fluff :/\n\nI know there aren't any easy answers out there... especially since this is a bit sparse on details, but if anyone has pertinent experience they can parlay, that would be super helpful :)\nTL;DR:"}

I've spoken to her about it multiple times and she always comes back with \"i just don't know how to deal with emotional things like that, I don't know how to respond back.\" I know she cares about me and likes me. This leads me to why I haven't told her I loved her yet because I'm afraid the feeling won't be reciprocated or she'll get too freaked out. i've been told she's a commitment-phobe, so the fact that she's been dating me for a year is a definitely a positive thing. I just wish she could meet me halfway sometimes or not make me feel like I have to hold back telling her what I feel for her. she's a highly independent woman that likes to deal with things on her own so I've also learned that if she's in a bad mood or doesn't want to talk, I give her space and let her figure things out (not a problem, but just giving more backstory). i feel like I'm at a standstill and it makes me wonder if i should back off emotionally so i don't get burned in the future. any suggestions since I'm not making any headway?\nTL;DR:"}

Dating this wonderful, sweet girl for about 10 months.  First relationship, always avoided them as I've always seen myself as too selfish to indulge in a relationship. Really like her, really like her friends, really like her family. Drop dead gorgeous. She is head over heels in love with me. I get this overwhelming feeling of guilt because I feel like my affection for her has plateau'd and given that this is my first relationship I determine it's probably because I have no base to which to compare my affection. I'm incredibly calculating with regards to my emotions, as much as I hate it, and I realized that in the long run, I would always be wondering what if I had dated other people, what would I have found... and it would have developed into resentment, and just been a gnawing misgiving for there for the rest of our relationship. Instead I decided to end things so I can play the field more, get more experience with relationships so that I can determine what I am truly looking for. It came out of left field and devastated her.  There was literally no way she saw it coming and all she keeps asking is what she did wrong.  But honest to god it's me.  There are small things that she would do that would be off-putting, but it was nothing we couldn't talk about.   It was incredibly tough for me to actually break up with her. I still feel incredibly guilty and I know she is still devastated. She's taken a leave of absence from her work. I feel so terrible.\n\nI can't help but wonder if I made a terrible mistake but I know these feelings I was having cannot be healthy for a relationship. Hell, who knows, maybe one day in the far future the stars will align and we can get back together. I thought I'd feel relief because I don't have this guilty conscience... but I just feel terrible. Did I fuck up?  I have an overwhelming urge to call her and sympathize with her, but my friends say it will just make it harder on her.\nTL;DR:"}

I am also a member of the United Afghan Club at UCLA. \n\nEvery year, 10-15 Afghan UCLA students successfully throw a huge fundraising banquet to help a specific need in Afghanistan. Over the years, we have been able to raise over $50,000 and have built 5 Wells in remote parts of the country, helped fund a school for over a year, and helped Afghan women. \n\nThis year, we are throwing our fundraising banquet on February 11th and hoping for our biggest turnout yet. 100% of the proceeds will go directly to funding a maternity ward in the Nangahar Province in Afghanistan. \n\nAccording to both the CIA WorldFactbook, and the United Nations Population Division, Afghanistan's infant mortality rate is the worst in the entire world, with roughly 150 deaths of infants below the age of 1 per 1,000 live births. For a comparison, the United States is only at about 7 deaths per 1,000 live births. \n\nThis means that infants born in Afghanistan have over a 2,100% higher chance of dying before the age of 1 than children born in the United States. (No, 2,100 is not a typo)\n\nReddit, please help us do our part to lower this number!

I currently work for minimum wage in that sector, albeit in a backroom non-customer facing role. For the most part I'm happy with the position, I enjoy the repetitive nature and the fact I can go in, do my job, and come home. The only thing it lacks is the respectable wages and I'm starting to try and come up with new ways to try and find a job.\n\nThe thing is I'm diagnosed as suffering from Schizoid Personality Disorder, with obsessive and paranoid traits. For the most part I like to live a fairly simple life. I don't go out, I have virtually no social commitments (i.e. friends/spouses/children) and no plans to. I have no hobbies besides drinking excessive amounts of coffee and for the most part am what others would describes as an utterly boring person, bordering on the obsessive when it comes to work. \n\nAt the end of the day I want a repetitive job: data entry, copyediting, or whatever. The sort of stuff you get on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (except available outside the US) that I can work 60+ hours a week for a decent wage. Being that I live in the aforementioned remote location I have little option but working from home since I can't afford to move nearer a city. So my newest idea was to identify local or regional companies and start sending of emails asking for work at home positions doing practically anything, whilst pushing the schizoid side of things? So my question is\u2026 will is ever have any possible chance of working? Or am I just pissing into the wind with the idea and burning bridges with companies before I've even begun.\nTL;DR:"}

I did contact her once, by text in August just to see how she was doing. This was about 4 months post-breakup and she let me know that she wasn't ready to talk to me yet.\n\nToday is her birthday. It's now been almost 6 months since the breakup, and I am torn on whether she would be more hurt by me sending birthday wishes or not sending them.\n\nAny insight?\nTL;DR:"}

Now, though we are long distance whilst I'm at uni, it's been an incredible relationship so far. We visit each other twice a month, staying for the weekend, we talk every day, we laugh, we experience things together, we enjoy each other. In short, he's my very best friend. We have a real future together.\n\nI've been home for the past month on Easter break and it's been lovely. We celebrated our first anniversary. Recently (past few days), however, thing's have changed. He says he feels very anxious when he thinks of me and is very nervous when talking to me/being with me. He also says that he doesn't want to be around me.  He has no idea why. He's completely torn up about it as we love each other very much and are so happy together; this is completely out of the blue and he can't understand why he feels this way. It's incredibly painful, for the both of us.\n\nI've just spent the morning with him and told him to carry on his life as normal, that this will pass. He's into his sports so I made him promise me he'll still attend all his activities. Reddit, help! He hasn't been eating, sleeping, working, he can barely get out of bed because his anxiety and this sense of doom (specifically targeted at me) is crushing.\n\nI love him so much, what can I do to help him through this??\nTL;DR:"}

This happened without me giving Any hints to how I felt, AWESOME. \n\nWe email and text each other constantly after that day. We've discussed how she can't up and leave her boyfriend of 4 years just yet. Why? They live together at his place and she needs to sort that out before doing anything else. Her parents houses (separated) are not acceptable and I still live with mine (planning on moving out by the end of the year - I'm 26 ffs).\n\nLast week things accelerated and we commenced sexy time. She keeps telling me how breaking up with her boyfriend isn't as straightforward as I'd like it to be and I sort of understand that. But we can't keep our hands off each other, even if her boyfriend is right there with us (ninja school and all that). \n\nI've no idea what to do or how long to wait. She feels guilty that she's cheating, claiming this is the only time in her life that she's done this. But also she claims she doesn't want to stop. I also share part of the guilt, but I don't want to stop either. \n\nSorry if all this sounds so jumbled, but there's so much that was said and has happened that it's pretty hard to focus on one thing.

We are generally extremely happy and open with each other. He does maintain a strong relationship with his ex-gf of many years (I think they have been apart for about two or three years after a nearly decade long relationship). I have spoken to him about this and he says he has told her we are together and that they have established boundaries. I trust him completely and my trust of him was not a deciding factor in looking at his e-mail.\n\nHowever, I decided to go through his e-mail when he left it open on the computer the other day. It was a spontaneous decision made out of curiosity, not because I felt like I had any reason not to trust him.  I know this was wrong and I feel guilty about betraying his trust.\n\nBut, I found e-mails from his ex confessing that she still had feelings for him.  His response was interesting. He didn't reciprocate her feelings, but he didn't shoot her down either. He told her that they would be able to see each other again, but didn't make any implications beyond that. He also didn't say that he was currently committed to someone. On one hand, I can understand this, as they have a longstanding interpersonal relationship and still value each other - I can understand him not wanting to cause her pain, when her letter to him clearly indicated she was hurting. On the other hand, I feel very hurt and afraid and both regret looking at the e-mails and think it might be a good springboard into a discussion. \n\nWe have been talking about our future together. One of my fears is that I'm just a placeholder - that the distance between the two of them is the only reason he's interested in me.  I am also afraid that he's with me because being in a relationship is better than the alternative for him.\n\nObviously, the top answer is going to be \"talk to him.\" Communication is the only way we're going to be able to sort this out.

It was affecting her sleep with nightmares and she had panic attacks.\n\n I care for her deeply and tried to help but it was difficult despite me being able to empathize with her plight. Another factor was that she didn't like opening up  to me and at times I questioned how she felt about me truly. \n\nNear the end, she friend zoned me, citing her reasoning that she wasn't looking for anything too serious knowing full well that I had asked her weeks earlier to try long distance. \n\nAfter the summer, we kept in contact and kept talking. I decided to visit her in Utah to spring the question and take her on a real date when last week she told me she started dating someone else.\n\n But despite all that she still relies upon me for support during her panic attacks since, quote, \"I am the only person who cares enough.\" That apparently I am the only person whom she trusts, not even her new boyfriend. \n\nFor me personally, I am conflicted.

I'm dating an awesome girl for about 3 months now. Things are great and wonderful in every facet but I recently got some more information on something she'd mentioned briefly before and it's just kinda got me confused.\n\nSo in college she had a female roommate/friend who eventually developed into something more...she said they became very close, were physical and would make out, and to me it seems like it was basically a relationship that carried on for several months at least. \n\nShe said that she was clinically depressed at the time, and that once she got healthy again she realized that wasn't what she wanted and ended that with her roommate. She said that she is 100% attracted to men and that thinking back to that time makes her very uneasy and embarrassed. Other than that relationship she's never really dated...been involved with a guy for a couple weeks once or twice before she broke it off.\n\nI support LGBT folks completely and have no problem with that. And by every measure I can see she is 100% attracted to me...we haven't had intercourse (she wants to wait) but have had oral sex, etc, very physical. I guess I'm just confused because I haven't known anyone else who has had a similar instance in their past. I think I'd be less confused if she had just said she was bisexual. I know some people will fight against gay/lesbian feelings due to cultural pressure by entering hetero relationships. She does come from a strong religious background. So really just was wondering if anyone could offer another viewpoint/advice on this.\nTL;DR:"}

She was up front and honest with me about the fact that she wants to give me the best chance I can, and right now she can't do that and she doesn't want to string me along. She's told me this isn't an excuse for her to go off with a bunch of other guys looking for something better, she wants to focus on herself for a while. I honestly do feel we still have a shot in the future, it'll just take some time for her to figure herself out.\nI've realized we can't hang out as much or text as much as we used to since I need to give her space. In terms of hanging out, I think we'll hang out occasionally and it'll be fine, we're just no longer gonna be like \"I'm bored, come over and hang out\". I've gotten used to texting her almost all day, but now I've got to dial that back. How much should I dial it back? I don't want there to be no texting, I still want to talk to her to be her friend and also show I'm still interested in her, while also giving her space. \n\nShe's been away this past week, so she told me all this stuff about needing to figure herself out while she was there. When she comes back, I know we're gonna discuss all this and figure out our hanging out/texting situation, she's made it clear she still wants to do all that as well.

The mom (we'll call her B) is hitting it off with my mom, which is nice to see. B introduces me to her 19yo son (we'll call him T). Although a bit socially awkward, T is a nice kid; we're into a lot of the same things (LotR, Potter, Star Wars, the Trek, Nerdfighteria, Doctor Who, history, paranormal... ect.) So there's someone here I could be friends with... \n\nThe thing is, B is trying to sell T off to me like my name's Charles fucking Bingley. T isn't oblivious to this, and finds his mother's actions meddling, I find them awkward. Like I said, T's a nice *kid*; if he were 10 years older, had a beard, and shook off that innocence *maybe* he'd be close to my type. I've made it clear to T I'd like to be friends, even though he's mentioned he likes girls of my body type, and my reading glasses are \"attractive\".\n\nWhat has led me to /r/askreddit is that this morning T rings my bell, saying B had told him I had asked where he was the night before. In truth, my mom & I were taking cookies over to the new neighbors. B was outside, so we stopped by for a quick chat, where she volunteered the information that T was at a friends house. I had not asked, and only replied with \"Oh, that's nice\".\n\nI've never been in this situation before (usually I'm the one trying to impress parents), and I don't know how to go about this so I don't ruin a potential friendship between B & my mom, and T & I.\nTL;DR:"}

We met there, both born there, and I moved to take a job.\n\nPredicament: Talked on the phone today, heard she had done a photo shoot for a local artists exhibit. Previously, she had been asked to do a music video for a band that involved full nudity and to go so far as people basically feeling her up. She declined, but I was still infuriated anyone would just come out and ask that question. I don't know who he is or if he was sincerely an artist looking for a model. It wasn't, to my knowledge, an erotic setting other than what she describes as a lingerie-esque top with booty shorts. She explained that it wasn't full nudity or anything to the extent of what I think it was.\n\n Instantly after hearing she did that, I became infuriated. I felt like someone had taken advantage of her which was clearly not the case. I felt like someone had taken something I hold very dearly to me and violated it. More or less, someone had seen what I only should see. \n\nI'm not claiming her as property, I understand it is her body and she will do whatever she pleases with it within the confines of a monogamous, committed relationship. She is not the type of person to be unfaithful nor does she just flash every passerby. She is modest in her own way. \n\nMy questions to the reddit world is: why does it bring up such strong feelings? Why do I feel so...violated, if that's the correct term? How can I come to grips with it and let it pass? Why do things like this illicit these reactions and feelings?\nTL;DR:"}

Things have been very hot, heavy, and intense as fuck. We've been pretty close to inseparable since we started hanging out again. I've been having love type feelings for him since day one (pretty much), but I've been holding back from saying anything. He just got out of a relationship and it seemed he wanted to take things slow. So I was working with that and holding back. Plus, I was afraid of jumping in too deep too fast with him. We've sort of slipped and called each other \"love\" endearingly, but hadn't said \"I love you\". To me, it should be special. Not necessarily reciprocated at that moment, but still a special moment. Last night he asked me several times to say it to him, so I did, against my better judgement. And I got nothing in return. He just wanted me to say it to him, he wanted to hear it. I felt so vulnurable. I had opened up to him in the past, but it had been my choice to show that to him. I was the one who mentally prepared before ripping off the bandaid. This time, he ripped it off. If I had told him when I was ready, even if he wasn't ready to say it back yet, it would be totally different.\n\nI'm feeling vulnerable, hurt, and angry at him for convincing me to do that without considering my feelings. I tried to talk to him about it, but he doesn't really see anything wrong with it. He doesn't like that it upset me, and believes that anytime I try to talk to him about it it will just turn into a fight. I don't want to fight, I just want him to understand how badly he hurt me by not considering my feelings and how saying that would affect me. Any advice on how to handle this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

As far as helping me quit, it was amazing. I didn't even think about cigarettes while on the pill, and I only took half the recommended dosage. \n\nUnfortunately, 4 months later I got an infection and was prescribed an antibiotic. One that contained a sulfonamide. Before taking Chantix I was not allergic to anything. I had a severe reaction that I quickly learned is called Steven Johnson Syndrome ( \n\nIt consisted of skin peeling off of my body, only in the most sensitive of places. Starting in my mouth. I remember moving my tongue around and feeling a tiny piece of skin as if I had burnt my mouth. Then the chunk grew in size to about a quarter. Then more chunks. Then more places. My dermis was separating from my epidermis. Mainly in my armpits, mouth, butt region, and yes even on my flesh oboe. \n\nIt was a 3 week nightmare of excruciating pain. I was very depressed because I read that it was pretty serious and that you can die from it. Obviously I stopped the antibiotics that caused the immunological reaction, and i slowly healed. Thankfully I have no scars. \n\n3 years later now, is it retarded of me to wish I could take chantix again to stop smoking? If I already have SJS now, could something worse happen?

We envision how the events will unfold in our  mind and we go and execute our surprise, only to have everything go horrible wrong.   I want to write a book that is a collection of stories of how gift giving has gone wrong.  \n\nFor instance when I proposed to my wife I had set up before hand a picnic on the beach with candles and champagne at sunset.  When I go to get my wife for a walk on the beach, she throws every excuse at me and had to practically beg her to go on a beach walk.  Once I get her on the beach and we get to our spot I had previously prepared  she stood their arguing with me how this was someone else picnic and not ours.  By the time I had convinced her that this was indeed our spot the sun was about to set completely.  After we sat things got completely dark and we could barely see each other.  I did not think to check whether there was going to be a moon out that night.  So after some time I finally get the nerve to ask her to marry me and I pull out the ring, but because it was so dark she freaked at first and knocked the ring box out of my hand having the ring fall into the sand.

I have been married for 5 years already with 2 awesome kids. My wife is 5 years younger than I am and feels like she wants to constantly go out on the weekends with her girlfriends. I personally don't like that cause we live in a pretty dangerous city(juarez, mexico). My older son also doesn't like it when she goes out, he cries and just wants her mom back. Well she can't fucking see how that's affecting our son. Our relationship has been really rocky for the last year or so and we have tried to make it work. But about a month or so shit just fell apart and right now we're at a point where we both don't really give a fuck about each other and are eager to go our own way. The main thing that's keeping me from pulling the trigger is my kids, god i think about them and I feel like a horrible person for doing this to them. We try and not fight in front of them but just today I fucking snapped and just grabbed her by the wrist to get her to shut the fuck up and stop insulting me, sure i wasn't all her fault but we just can't fucking back down anymore. Once it starts it just keeps on building up until I just decide to not give a fuck and walk away to cool off. The second thing keeping me from leaving is our financial situation. We got about 2.5k in debt. She's currently a stay at home mom and the best job she's going to get is min wage in mexico which is like 60 bucks a week in the us. I have absolutely no one I can think of that I can talk about these things, my dad is gone and i just feel really weird talking to my mom about it. A big part of our fights and arguments is that she's had to move in with us... is a very long story. But i don't want to be the son that fucking kicked his mom out of his house. She doesn't have anyone else in this city but me. So are there any couples out there that have been able to step back from the edge of divorce and actually fix the marriage or is that just a fairy tale?\nTL;DR:"}

He couldn't fall asleep so he ended up leaving me \nall alone in his bed while he went to the living room to do some work late at night.\n\nThat night was the first time we saw each other in 2 weeks so I understand he could have been eager \nto have sex, but when he just abandoned me just hurt so badly, and I felt like I was used, even felt \nlike I was his personal whore or something.\n\nWhat do you guys think? He usually says good night to me but he didn't even say that tonight either.......I don't know. Should I break up with him?

I was always chubby, shy, soft-spoken. Zero confidence. In the past I've realized I have date and seemed to attracted some girls that were bottom of the barrel and just generally full of negative qualities: overweight, alcohol/drug issues, abusive, mental health issues, promiscuous, so and so forth. Basically, just really trashy girls.\nWithin the last year or two I've fortunately had a lot of stuff go my way. I graduated from school, got a real salaried big boy job, and relocated. I lost a lot of weight and got in shape. I find that the type of girls that would have never given me the time of day actually pay quite a bit of attention now. I've hooked up with and dated some really attractive girls, but I feel sometimes just insecure and don't really want anything long term with them. I guess I feel like they're too good for me.\nAnyway, I'm currently dating someone who's probably and just basically a high-quality human being. She's fit, she's intelligent, she came from a stable, healthy family. But most importantly she's just very sweet, caring, warm girl. I just can't get it out of my mind that I don't \"deserve\" this for some reason though. I've never been with someone this attractive or stable.\nHow do I deal with this? I just want to feel comfortable with all this.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been out three times and on the last occasion we expressed our feelings for each other, held hands and kissed multiple times. \n\nThe only problem was that she wasn't looking for a relationship right now. She constantly told me that she didn't want to hurt me and that we have to be careful we don't fall too deep. She was in a long relationship that ended about 8 months ago. This was the first time I kissed a girl so I was on top of the moon.\n\nThe week after she reduced contact and then finally texted me 'we need to have a little chat' and my heart sank. So the reduced contact remains for the next couple of days until I say 'when do you want to have this chat'\n\nShe then responds she's trying to see when she's free and that it won't be the most pleasant of chats. I texted her back saying 'I'm pretty sure I know what it's about' which she responds 'I'm so sorry, it's made me sick thinking about it yada yada yada'\n\nThe thing is I've never connected with someone so much and she said the same thing. One night we talked on the phone until 2am and we pretty much were forced off the phone because my battery died.\n\nIn the past when things haven't worked out for me I've just accepted them and let them be but I woke up the next morning and felt like this is something that I need to fight for.\n\nIs this something worth fighting for? I've need had so much chemistry or connection with a girl before and I just can't stop thinking about her.\n\nSince this could be my first relationship I was thinking that I am willing to wait for her so I can learn and experience just being with a girl.

I was going to trade in my car too, so I had a look (at the place my car was getting serviced), found one I liked and put a refundable deposit down on it to reserve it. \n\nMy car got through its service fine, they told me my oil would need topped up in 7,000 miles and nothing else needed done, so I started driving the 6 miles to another car garage, where I was going to get it valued. As I was driving, smoke started to pour from the front of the car, and as I pulled into the car garage I looked behind and saw I had been trailing oil the whole way. I checked the oil - I had none left. I went inside the car garage to get a professional, and he told me the car could have burst into flames at any point and I couldn't drive it under any circumstances. I was a little shaken - I called the place that performed the service and they called me a taxi to get back to them. When I got there they said that they would pick up my car from the other garage on Monday, but that they couldn't comment on the problem until they'd got the car and started their investigation. They gave me a car to get home with, which they said I can keep it 'for as long as I need it'.\n\nI don't know what damage has been done to my own car, but if I had started to drive home on the motorway the consequences could have been disastrous. I'm now waiting for them to begin their investigations, but have no idea whether or not I should get a lawyer involved, or if I am entitled to any sort of compensation for what looks to me like negligence on their part.\nTL;DR:"}

The spread is delicious...honey chicken with saffron rice and a few more dishes i cant remember.

I feel like it's kinda assumed we're going to have sex. I want to, but I'm not sure I'm entirely ready.\n\nThings are going so great with us. We haven't had an exclusivity talk. I am fairly positive he isn't dating other people, but I know to never, ever assume this. I feel such a connection with him and so far from what I can see it's entirely mutual. We've exchanged things like, \"I can't wait to get to know you better.\" and \"You're so amazing, I'm so happy I met you, etc.\"\n\nHonestly? I'd really, really like for him to call me his girlfriend. If I had sex with him next weekend, could this hurt the chances of him wanting to commit? I want to know we're exclusive before we have sex, but honestly I'd really like to be his girlfriend beforehand too. The problem is that in my dating experience (which is quite a bit) I've learned that nothing kills the flames like the, \"So, what are we doing?\" talk. It brings things to an unsexy, screeching halt.

She works at a department store, walking around selling perfume. While theres absolutely nothing wrong with working a job like this, I feel like the fact that she invested $200,000 of her own money in a degree yet still chooses to work retail is a waste of her talent and money. I was hoping the good people of reddit could help me figure out something to say to her in order to get her motivated.\n\nI want to do this in the most calm and loving way possible so that she does not go on the defensive, and so that she can truly see I'm just looking out for her because I know she can do better.\n\nI know many of you might say \"the job market is really tough right now, it's not her fault\" but that shouldn't keep her from trying. Her problem isn't getting jobs, its applying for them, she just doesn't do it.

My gf [20] and I [24] having been seeing each other for just over a month now. Not long in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI can't even begin to describe how I feel for her, and how she feels for me. Soulmates would be the closest description, but even that doesnt due justice for how we feel towards one another. Both of us have previously been in long term relationships before, but neither of us have ever felt what we feel towards each other with any of our previous relationships. We each feel extremely vulnerable. We are constantly thinking about how much we mean to each other and vice versa. Knowing that someone else in this world has that sort of power over yourself is an extremely disconcerting feeling for both of us.\n\nBecause of this we are both always afraid of losing each other, and how it would just destroy us. This feeling of potential loss of each other is really taking its toll on both of us. We have an extremely open and honest relationship with each other, which is incredible. We've discussed this issue on several occasions now.\n\nWe have an analogy that we each use to describe our relationship to with others. Its like giving a blind man sight for the first time in his life. He lived just fine without it before, but now that he has it, it is the most amazing and wonderful thing in existence. Should he lose it again, would he survive? Yes. But never again could he appreciate anything in his new life knowing what he had before. This is how we feel about each other. We have given each other sight for the first time, and we are both so worried to lose it. How can we possibly address this issue? Obviously dwelling over it is completely wrong (we both know this) and neither of us can predict the future of how we will each feel in the future, but all of that is of little comfort at the moment. We are each so vulnerable. Any advice out there on how we can deal with this seemingly idiotic problem??\nTL;DR:"}

It never really ended until quite recently. \n\nI met 25F when I was a sophomore, and was instantly impressed. She is cool, funny, smart, beautiful, the works. I was too afraid of screwing things up with my current relationship to try to start a new one. I know that this was a mistake. The first relationship really didn't pan out, but that's another story.\n\nLong, long story short: 25F is graduating in less than a week. She is going to take a year off and try to do some online grad school in her hometown, far away from where I'm going to college. After that year, she reports to the Air Force for a 4-5 year rotation in Hawaii. I really, really like her, and have reason to believe she likes me too. Obviously, it sucks that I've waited until the last minute.\n\nI really want to tell her how I feel - that I always liked her, that I want to be with her, and that I am sorry for never having told her sooner. I am just worried if this would upset her - assuming she had feelings for me too, would she be upset that I waited this long to tell her, now that she's leaving?

My roommates, who are also my best friends, have been very good with putting up with her being here, but as of recently have started to ask that she spends less time, because they miss having me alone, and doing stupid teenage stuff with them.

A few weeks ago I noticed a strange bruise-like mark on the bottom of my heel. I had just started running barefoot about once per week, but prior to that I wasn't really paying attention to the soles of my feet, so I really can't say if it happened before or after the barefoot running. But of course when I tell that to other people they say obviously I bruised my heel or got some kind of fungus or something. However, it doesn't hurt or itch at all and it's a little raised, making me think it's a mole I never noticed before. The shape is very asymmetrical and the color is uneven purple/black/brown. If you type in foot melanoma on google images (DON'T DO IT, it's pretty gross) there are many pictures that look just like what I have. So I made a doctor's appointment already for the 18th to get it checked out, but now I just want to cancel it because I have 2 races coming up and I don't want a doctor scraping stuff out of my foot with a scalpel in an important part of my training.\nTL;DR:"}

We are doing a bit better and about five to six months ago decided to get a new dog.  We got a new puppy and my older cat is *terrified* of the puppy.  It can't be in the same room as the puppy without being on a counter or something.  The puppy is not violent in the slightest and gets along with my little cat just fine.  The little cat and the puppy will take naps with each other and just be very pleasant to each other, if not exactly 100% buddy-buddy.\n\nWhat concerns me is that my little cat and my older cat have been fighting a bit more recently.  At first it seems like they are trying to play, but then it turns violent with hissing and yowling and such.  The two cats used to be best friends, always hanging out with each other, now they just seem to hate each other.  This started occurring since my dog was put down.  It has escalated since the new puppy came home.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what a good solution is for this situation.  I've tried spraying them with some water when they start fighting, which breaks it up for a time, but then they're back at it.  I don't think they're to the point where they're a threat to one another, but they're certainly no longer friends.\n\nMy younger cat was a rescue, my older cat was picked up from a litter from a friend of the family, both are spayed and both are female.\nTL;DR:"}

After we have argued for a half hour/hour, I ask her to please go to her place so we can both cool off, but she refuses. I cite that she cannot really do so because it is my house and I am asking her to go, but she says she is entitled to existing in my space since we are in a relationship. This feels incredibly false to me.

Had been going on dates for about 2 months before I finally popped the question about her being my gf. Things seem good and I like everything about her except for the fact that we've only seemed to hangout/go on dates when I've asked and set it up. I feel like at times that if I never planned stuff between us we would never see each other and our whole relationship would just be us chitchatting over text or facebook since we both go to different post secondary institutions. \n\nDue to a previous relationship in which my ex and I rarely got to hangout + I was told I was clingy, I am worried as I want to bring up my concerns with her about her never asking to hangout but without coming off as clingy/etc\u2026 My friends all happen to be in relationships atm as well and regularly bring their gf/bf to group events so I've become even more self-conscious of how little we see each other in comparison to them\nTL;DR:"}

When we started dating he 'wooed' me beyond belief. I asked him if it bothered him that I didn't shave and he said no. A year and a half later we barely have sex (maybe once a month) and I couldn't figure out why. My boyfriend finally admitted that finds me unattractive because I don't shave, in that he finds all body hair to be unattractive. I don't shave because I believe that there is a double standard for women to shave in order to look beautiful, I believe I am beautiful the way I look naturally. I am not one to wear makeup or get dolled up either and this doesn't seem to bother him. I love him so much and would do anything for him but is going against something I believe in in order for my significant other to find me attractive just completely fucking stupid or am I holding onto something that doesn't really mean that much?\nTL;DR:"}

She also touched my arms and pointed out how veiny i was. Don't know if that was her way of flirting. Sorry, I just can't read shy girls so I need some help.

I was at a party months ago, and was hitting on this girl, when I asked for her number she told me she had a boyfriend, but I got it anyways. \n\nI saw her a couple times in passing and have had conversations with her, she seemed nice and cool, she's pretty too. \n\nAnyhow, fast forward to last week, where were at the same house where we met. We were both drunk and I heard her mention that she broke up with her boyfriend about a month ago. \n\nSo I decided to make a move, to which we ended up making out for an hour or two, and then went back to my place to spend the night (nothing else happened). \n\nA couple of days later, we hung out in my room and just talked and watched TV (was kind of boring), and when it was time for her to go, I walked her to her car and tried giving her a goodnight kiss. She didn't reciprocate, but she didn't pull away either. I was extremely confused.\n\nFast forward again to this last weekend, where I invited her to come to a party with us when she declined, not really giving a reason but still talkative. \n\nBut the thing is, throughout all the time that I've known her, I got a strong vibe that she liked me and wanted to spend time with me. I've been thinking about texting her this next Thursday or Friday maybe to ask her to dinner or a movie or something. What are your guys' thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

I didn't think that 5-6 months was that long to wait for me to graduate, so we couod be together. He always promised he would stay in town with me. \n\nHowever, he says he still loves me and wants to do long distance and then get back together after I graduate (even though he has no idea of where he will work/if he will get a job). \n\nI think it's crazy that after 3 years he wants to just up and leave me without any real reason (besides free rent).

So here I go:\n\nI feel like I'm always the one initiating contact and that she doesn't really take the initiative to communicate.  Sorry if this sounds kind of selfish, but hear me out.\n\nI'm usually propose and plan out dinners, dates, and pretty much any activity we go to.  On Skype, I'm always the one to start the conversation and I can't remember the last time she has.  If I don't say anything, there's simply no conversation.  Same applies for texting.  At school, I'm always the one who seeks her out. In general, I'm always pushing for the contact.\n\nI only find this kind of strange because when I look to most other couples (generally speaking), both sides seem to be putting effort into spending time with eachother.  They wait for eachother after class, for lunch, and what not.  I understand relationships are different for everyone, but I'm still puzzled over this.  She's said she genuinely likes me and wants/likes to spend time with me, but her actions say otherwise.  \n\nShe's quite busy will school and intern work at times and I try to help her with it as much as possible.  On the note of her personality, she's kind of shy and indecisive.  \n\nIs there any explanation as to why it's like this and how I could change it? Am I simply acting too needy?\n\nI like her a lot, and I really don't want to see the relationship go wrong because of something like this.\nTL;DR:"}

I've posted here before, but I'm gonna introduce myself anyway. I'm 18, and I've been working my dream job for 6 months today! I run the doggie daycare at my vet's office. It's a full time, 8-5, m-f job I was lucky to get. Before I started, they had kennel staff doing daycare, but it was never the same person and never consistent. Since I've started, daycare has grown a TON. I started off with 2 or 3 \"regulars\" who came daily or weekly, but I've got a solid list of 20-30 dogs that come on a regular basis. I bring my own dog, and a lot of the staff at the vet bring their dogs to daycare while they're working. Right now, I've got 17 dogs in one room, ranging from a 12 week old pit puppy, to goldens, labs, shepherds, pointers, danes, terriers, hounds, collies, and a papillion. Throw in toys, and its exactly as crazy as it sounds. It's just me, an 18 year old girl, up here alone with all these critters all day. Of course I have help from the other staff, but it's just me up here for the most part. It's loud, and I have to wear earplugs, but it's fun. I've got music playing, and snacks and a drink, and everyone just does their thing. I've had very few fights, and everyone plays nicely for the most part. Its like I've got my own little world and its chaotic and loud and can be scary at times, but I have control, and I can handle it. It may not be much in the real spectrum of things, but I know that I'm really lucky to have found a job that I love, and I'm great at.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: Can I fix my fuck up or should I just deal with it?\nPOST: I (25f) broke up with my boyfriend (28m) of five months a few days ago.  We never really spent more than a few hours two or three days a week together.  I would've liked to spend more time with him and he knew that.  I kind of felt like things were always on his terms as far as when we hung out, when plans changed, when we talked about things that were bothering us, etc.  \n  Last week we had a hiccup with me not finding something to be nearly as funny as he did.  He took my reaction as thinking his thing was stupid therefore thought he was stupid.  He wanted to talk about it so we talked about it on Sunday.  We cleared things up and during the conversation he said sometimes he felt smothered.  The next day I was still feeling weird about the whole situation so I asked him if we could talk again and he told me it would have to wait until the next day.  The more I thought/dwelled about it I realized that we spend a maximum of 10 hours a week hanging out so if that's not enough time for me and it's leaving him feeling smothered, how can we ever be happy together?  Since he couldn't take five minutes to call me up to discuss this with me and set my mind at ease I told him it didn't seem like it was working for either of us.  \n  Now I'm regretting breaking up with him.  He's super sweet, thoughtful, fun to be around and completely relationship retarded.  Had I just been patient enough to wait and talk the next day I don't think we would have broken up.  We are giving each other a few weeks to sort stuff out before working on being friends.  Should I tell him how much I miss him and that I think I made a mistake or should I just lie in the bed I've made myself?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm also about to have a long hectic week and just wanna relax while seeing her and I don't wanna have to sleep on a couch with her two nights cause it's impossible to do. I also don't wanna have to wait for her to come back from the clubs because I feel like we wait enough already in between seeing each other.\n      The reason I feel bad is because she rarely sees this friend who is her best friend.

About 6 months ago, I moved an hour further away from my family to move in with him and we have a nice, quiet life together. Lately, though, I've been feeling detached emotionally and I've even been thinking about guys from my past, although I would never cheat on my boyfriend. \n\nA few months after we started dating he became less affectionate and I've brought it up to him many times. He once told me it comes in waves and he can't help it. We're similar personalities in that we don't like huge crowds or events, but I always pictured being in an \"us against the world\" type relationship and sometimes it feels like it's me against everyone else and him against me. \n\nHe's a good man and treats me well (gets me medicine when I'm sick, basically gives me anything I want), except for emotional attachment or affection. He's just reserved, whereas I'm the type to read and breath poetry and let it run off my lips. He almost makes fun of emotions and I can't seem to get past it. \n\nWe've always talked about getting married (although he thinks marriage is a silly concept), but lately I've been having doubts as to whether we're just too different. I don't talk to anyone about it because I feel guilty and like I'm constantly trying to change him. I feel as if it's building a wedge between us, me always criticizing the way he reacts to situations because he's harsh and I'm sensitive. \n\nHe doesn't even know I feel this strongly about it. I've been putting off saying anything until the weekend because we both work a lot and something like this could take all night to sort out. \n\nIf anyone has any advice, that would be great.

Hanging out with friends feels like an uncomfortable chore I often prefer to avoid, and being around family feels like commitment I wish I didn't have. I can't say I feel \"love\" for any of these people, and I feel that they are disposable to me in that, should they disappear or die, my life would not be for the worse.

Normally, he is very kind and patient but when he is in an argument he hits until it hurts, bringing up past relationships, insulting friends, demeaning me as a person.

They are in the process of a divorce. His choice, not hers. He said he was depressed and needed to be alone. As it turns out he's been seeing a younger woman at the company he owns. (I work at another company who occasionally has ties to the parent company, so sometimes i am forced to see this woman) He still denies it, even though my mom has thousands of dollars of bank transactions of him paying for lavish things for the two of them. The real bitch of it is, he is spending the time and money 10 minutes away from his own home. In a city next over, with the women who lives there.  So it's like he's home, but he's living a separate life. On top of that, he's got a health problem and his time is not too certain. (IVC filter was left in his chest during surgery and they never took it out, now it's impossible to remove) I keep trying to look past this whole second life thing and trying to talk to him, but he just keeps lying about it.\n\nDo I just accept the lies and try to build a phony relationship back up while I still can? I can't really imagine turning my back on my dad. Even though it seems like he's done that to us.\nTL;DR:"}

Now I'm ready. And she is not. And I understand how she felt. I guess I deserved this. I asked her a couple months ago and she said she's not ready because she's \"scared\". I should mention this would be her first relationship ever. \n\nAnyway, my point is... Obviously it doesn't matter. I have to face the fact that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me. She still wants to hang out and have sex. She wants to keep doing what we have been doing. This is so hard for me because she is my support system. She has always been here there for me and she is who I go to when I'm having trouble. She is my best friend.\n\nI'm going to her house today and I don't know what I'm going to say. I'm not good at communicating. Can someone help me figure out something to say? I don't know what I'm going to do and I'm having so much anxiety. \n\nThanks\nTL;DR:"}

About a year ago I quit my job to take a job in his city and we moved in together. It made sense because he had been at his employer for 10+ years and I wasn't happy with my job and I assumed there would be better opportunities here.\n\nLong story short; I love him but I hate it here. Before I moved I had my own house which I own outright and spent years renovating, a network of family and friends. Now I have nothing but him.\n\nI want to move back to my hometown and start a life there. He says he will follow me, but I worry that he will feel the way I feel now after the move.  I worry that if he leaves his job, his friends and his family behind he will grow to resent me.

My housemate is a runner, she used to obsessively run until she injured herself (too much running/not enough nutrition), so that was my first red flag. Now she is at the gym every day for multiple hours, in addition to her track and field practice (though, I don't know how much running she does there..)\n\nShe's told me she's had an eating disorder before, in fact, all three of us in the house have. But two of us have shifted towards a better life style and the other has been (seemingly) spiraling out of control. She eats a block of tofu for most meals, or a plate of peas, or yogurt. I worry about her a lot because she very obviously has self-image issues.\n\nIt's really hard for me, because she keeps comparing herself to me in every aspect of my life, my femininity, my relationship, my style, and it's putting a LOT of guilt on me. I feel like I can't go out of the house looking the way I want to look without hurting her in some way.\n\nAdditionally, she really doesn't have a concrete mindset, she has a really hard time making her decisions, and will agree with whatever I say, or feel self-conscious whenever I ask her to do something (e.g: \"Could you put your towel on a rack instead of leaving it on the floor?\" -- \"Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm so dirty, I really should clean the house more, you do it all the time.\" Then will proceed to clean the house). \n\nShe says it'll help if I don't worry about her, and if she is the one to bring it up. But she hasn't said a thing about her habits since she first confessed. When I see her in the kitchen, I worry. I don't know what she's doing in the bathroom. I'm stressing out. I can't concentrate on anything. And we've just agreed to stay in our house for another year. I'm not sure if I can take it.  What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

We're both 21 and have very strong feelings for one another.\nI work full time and am attending school next semester. She's currently in school while working part time. We don't live together, she lives 20 mins north of me. As we both have busy schedules, we have been accustomed to a ritual of hanging out on Tuesdays, when she has off work, and Friday through Sunday.\n\nI live in a duplex with one roommate, so I would rather not have loud, passionate sex with anon while he's home, so it makes timing difficult with sex. We've seemingly gotten into a schedule of sex. It's usually Tuesdays when my room mate is at work, and once or twice on the weekends. When our relationship began we were both pretty free, and we're fucking like rabbits. It was always surprised and passionate. Hardly ever like, \"dinner then sex\" or \"let's have sex after we go grocery shopping.\" but lately we've seen our sex life getting boring, and like a chore. It's not as spontaneous and passionate as before because we're expecting it when the time comes because we don't always get the opportunity, and when it presents itself, we take it. One complaint she has is I'll ask, \"Are we are going to get around to having sex at some point, we're finally alone.\" I know I shouldn't have to ask, but like I said, we don't always get the time to be alone.\n\nI'm having a difficult time putting this into words so I hope you guys get the idea. We both know this is a big deal, but we've gotten through a lot and I know this can get fixed. I need some ideas, some advice. I really haven't been in this serious of a relationship ever, or at least one that is this healthy. We both have genuine care for one another, we're each others best friends.

There was even a guy who she didn't know outside of Facebook, which I do not have.

Every time this happened she would cry to me the next day and swear she would change. The change would never last for more than 6 weeks.\n\nI left her for a month, and things were great for a few months after I returned to living with her again, but things started going sour and I had enough, so I decided to leave again. \n\nI want to point out where I messed up. I have an addiction to painkillers that I did hide from her until about a year into the relationship. I decided to tell her when I thought things were really going to be stable and work out.

Turns out I have over 47 hours accumulated\n-Company is regulated by DOT and is a passenger transit company (if that makes any difference). Our shifts are ~1-2 hour blocks of time and we have a penalty system in place for missing/arriving late/calling in shifts (called strikes)\n\nStory:\nI attempted to use some sick time today (for a medically valid reason, not because I wanted a day off) and followed the procedure outlined last week. Later in the afternoon, I received an email asking for medical proof (understandable) and advising me that I would be given maximum strikes for the day (10) for calling in my shifts. These strikes not only put me on \"probation\", meaning I cannot be up for a raise, and cannot have any screw ups in the next 8 weeks (though I have never had a strike before in the past 2+ years), but these strikes further prevent me from taking any more sick time in the coming weeks. \nI guess I just feel that it's wrong to be punished this severely (or at all) for taking a sick day-especially my first one ever. I don't want to sue or anything, I just don't know if what they're doing is totally legal, do I have any options?\n\n*(on a slightly just complaining note):The company (ie my direct supervisor) is requiring me to jump through a lot of hoops (phone calls, sending pictures of verification, emails that have time constraints) all today so that she can process my strikes. Can that not wait a day when I'm back?\nTL;DR:"}

I live and breath off of personal romantic connection. My best moments were when we would just hold each other, but after discovering the real her, that feeling went away, and I sort of resented her company, which is why we broke up.\n\nI think this is why I have always enjoyed romantic movies, since I could imagine myself as a character, and imagine myself in love. \n\nLately it has gotten worse, but as a fairly average looking male (not being self deprecating, it seems fairly accurate), and without much female interaction I have found it hard to find someone.\n\nThere are a few problems I have. I am picky, have low self esteem, and am kind of a nerd.

At first, it seemed like it was going to be something more casual, I didn't notice the age difference, we were just two adults having fun. Now it feels like it's becoming something serious. It didn't hit me until she asked me to go out with her family, her sister and brother in-law, for her birthday. I'm not sure how I feel about this. I'm not that experienced with casual dating or serious relationships.\n\nShe's extremely kind and caring and she gets my sense of humor. She doesn't have any kids or a previous marriage. She's educated, independent, attractive and fit. I have fun on our dates and enjoy spending time with her. She definitely treats me better than any other girl I've been with.\n\nThe only thing that's bothering me is the age gap. I would be extremely uncomfortable introducing her to my family. She's closer in age to my parents than me and twice the age of my younger brother. I am extremely uncomfortable meeting her sister who has a son and a daughter around my age (early 20's). Other people aside, it feels like she is ready for a lot of things I'm not ready for and she's grown out of things I haven't even finished growing into. I feel like it would be disappointing not experiencing those milestones together.\n\nMaybe, I'm thinking too far ahead or too much into this. I like her and I like being with her, but as superficial as it might sound, the age gap is bothering me and I can't see myself getting over it. I feel like it would be selfish to keep these feelings of uncertainty to myself. I'm just not sure how to bring it up or how to proceed. I want to be direct and honest with her, but I don't want to hurt her feelings.\nTL;DR:"}

What I wasn't expecting was what actually happened. She's normally very articulate and collected, but when I asked her out she seemingly became a little unglued. She seemed nervous suddenly, and frankly was rambling a bit. In the end she didn't answer my question, said \"I don't know\" a few times. I haven't seen this side of her before...and am not entirely sure what to make of it. I know when some girls say \"idk\" they really mean no...maybe that's the case here...I'm really not sure.

I'm what most people would probably consider beta seeing as how I'm shy and not the best with social settings. I've never had a girlfriend or even someone who's shown affection to me, other than a one-night-stand,  probably because I used to be obese (was 250 lbs) and had a shitty haircut (a buzz cut) which didn't help either.  Over the past year I've lost weight, still overweight but not as bad now (now 195 lbs)m and let my hair grow out.  So I look much more attractive than what I used to be. Also I'm oblivious as can be.\n\nOnto the main point, I've known this girl since the start of the fall semester.  We have similar interests and get along very well; she's basically my best friend at this point.  Over the past month we've been hanging out a lot more often just laying in bed watching movies, talking, and cuddling.  The reason I'm hesitant to think she likes me is because she is basically a slut, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that though.  \n\nI know you're probably thinking at this point that I'm an idiot for even considering trying to be anything more than friends with her considering I've never had a girlfriend before; which I agree with. I probably shouldn't even get my hopes up but when an attractive women shows me affection for the first time it was hard not to catch feels, but I already have. I'm not even looking for a girlfriend exactly, I'm just not sure how she feels towards me and it's driving me crazy.\nTL;DR:"}

He asked me how I liked the game and I said it was exciting and glad we won. He then asked me if I saw anything I liked during halftime. I immediately turned bright red in front of the whole class and had to explain that I thought I had stopped recording and was just playing with the camera.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Just applied for a Secured Citi MasterCard... nervous about approval, and questions about old debt\nPOST: I just applied for a Secured Citi MasterCard. My credit score according to Mint is 571 from Equifax and 546 from Experian. The reason its so low is because of debt that I didn't believe I owed so I never paid. Stupid, I know, but even so I couldn't afford to pay it back at the time even if I wanted to. \n\nThe debt was 2 years of Social Security backpay ($5668) because they didn't believe me when I told them I didn't know about bonds that my family took out for me when I was born.\n\nI just got a job in September. I've been paying $200/mo since then.\n\nBut if you look on my credit history, you'll see nothing but really good things, except for 2 years worth of \"late\" payments from the Social Security.\n\nThe thing is, you can still get denied for Secured Citi Cards, and I don't want to be because then I'll be fucked. I gave them a $300 deposit. I have had consistent income every two weeks since I've gotten the job. I don't have my Savings or Brokerage accounts in Citi, but hopefully they'll see I'm not a stupid kid anymore like I was when I got the debt in the first place.\n\n**My question about debt is: On my credit report, it's still marked as \"late\" for the months that I have paid. So I have to assume that will stop when I pay it off in full. BUT, I have enough in Savings to pay it off in full now. It won't leave me with too much but should I pay it off in one lump sum or should I keep paying it monthly?\nTL;DR:"}

So, I'm getting married in 11.5 weeks (not that I'm counting), and everything I have read says that's too early to send invitations. The general consensus seems to be that you send invites out 8-6 weeks before at the absolute earliest.  The thing is that half of our 200+ guests are from out of town, and I've already had a lot of calls and texts about people wanting to buy plane tickets and needing information.  I sent out save-the-dates to family a couple months ago, and we have a facebook event for the friends, both of which have links to the wedding website and travel/accommodations information, so it's not like they *need* invitations to be able to make those plans.  But doesn't it seem weird that people are having to spend money and make plans to travel to our wedding before they've been officially invited?\n\nAnyway,  I already have almost all the invitations finished and addressed, and I kinda want to send them out today.  I want to get RSVP's and have people look at my registry! I think it'll be exciting!  Am I being silly and overly eager?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: Need some advice about what to do with my life.\nPOST: This is my first time posting here as I thought it was really the only place I can speak my mind without fear of judgment. So here's my story:\nI'm currently a university student, a junior, majoring in biology. The reason I majored in biology was because I had hopes of becoming a dentist. Not for any reasons other than a chance at a high paying job and better future. But now as I think about it more and more, I'm really unhappy about this decision. I don't think I'll be happy even if I do make it as a dentist. What I really want to do is study psychology and hopefully learn enough to become a social psychologist or therapist of some sort. I want to help those with social anxiety, introversion, social awkwardness, depression, and alexithymia. I have mild cases of all these psychological problems also, but over the last few years of my life, I've been able to conquer and overcome some of these challenges. Now what I want to do in the future is to help others with these problems. I want to make a difference in someone else's life in a more positive way. From browsing reddit for so long, I realized that many users here have the same psychological problems as I do. Some overcome them, however there are still many others that remain hopeless. So here's my main concern. I don't know how to tell my parents or anyone for that matter that this is what I am truly passionate about. I've already told so many people that I want to be a dentist and I feel like I would be going back on my word if I do so. For one thing, I don't like it when others go back on their words about something, and also I have trouble expressing my thoughts verbally. So in the end, what do you guys think? Should I just stick it out with the whole dentistry thing and make a difference in some other way? (Eg. community service, donating to shelters, etc..)\nTL;DR:"}

I'm just trying to understand both point of views and reach a mutual understanding that we both reach together.\n\nI also have a hard time trying to remain calm during these discussions after a while, because she always makes assumptions on what she thinks I'm trying to say, before I finish saying my point, and then she starts responding in an aggressive manner to something that I didn't even say.... And then when I try to explain how she misunderstands what I'm trying to say, she would get so heated by that point that she stops listening to what I'm saying, and continues on her retorts about the assumptions she made about what she thinks I'm saying.\n\nShe has shown effort that she wants our relationship to work too, but we are having a hard time trying to work out a method of communication that will not spark heated arguments.\nAny tips/advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I've never lived with an SO, but the circumstances at the time made it seem like an easy decision.\n\nI enjoy spending time with her, but even in the beginning I didn't think the relationship would be a \"forever\" thing. Part of me feels like I'm just wasting time while waiting for the inevitable end. (That wording makes it sound worse than I mean.) I think that mindset also makes me not let myself get too attached. Neither of us are very good at initiating meaningful conversations which can make the relationship seem superficial.\n\nUnfortunately I haven't spent the time to make any good friends in my new city and my SO is really the only person I hang out with in person. I really like going out with her and even hanging out at home. At the same time, part of me thinks this is the only reason I'm staying in the relationship. I don't want to be all alone. To make it harder, we live together so I'd have to find a place to live and also buy almost all furnishings and living supplies. That's a tough barrier. Even if we broke up, I'd want to stay friends, but I know that's very unlikely to work out.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here.

I'm not afraid of him, but I also want to be respectful since I understand it's probably kind of a shitty situation for him, and so I have no idea how to proceed. And of course avoiding uncomfortable situations is the goal. Do I show the conversation to his mother? Do I keep it quiet and pretend like I never saw it?

I'm relieved. Its never been a happy marriage. My dad used to drink a lot and my mom started having affairs. \n\nSo I guess I can give you a little history of my family. I grew up lower middle class. My dad ranches and my mom is a nurse. Together they have two children, my brother (16) and I (21/F). \n\n-I never spent a whole lot of time with my mom, she worked a lot and in the end just didn't want me around. So I've grown up being a daddy's girl which also upset my mom. I bounced around from family member to family member when I was in middle school and high school because she didn't want me home. We finally kind of patched up our relationship when I went to college. She had major weight loss surgery and it completely changed her. I think her affairs started when I was in middle school and my dad's drinking got worse. They have continued up until now which has led to their divorce. She believes she is entitled to a settlement and I completely disagree. She really hasn't brought anything into the marriage. \n\nSo my question to reddit is that am I in the wrong for estranging myself from her except for maybe 10 minute interactions every couple weeks? She asks my roommate about me often but I just don't care anymore. I just feel that everything is everyone else's fault and she will never own up for anything that she does. Its my dad's fault she had affairs (8 at least), her mother didn't give her the attention that she needed, etc.\nTL;DR:"}

He compliments me all the time and it's obvious he's flirting with me. He confessed that he likes me.  He asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said no which is obviously true. I didn't tell him I had a wife. I get so shy and blush every time I'm around him. But it's not just him I constantly am thinking about how my life would be if I married a man and it seems like that's what I should have done.\n\nI'm so confused at the moment. So so so darn confused. I have been avoiding talking to my wife because I just have no idea what's going through my mind. I was raised very conservative and was taught that homosexuality was wrong. There has always been this thought in the back of my head telling me that getting married to this woman was wrong but then I tell myself I love her but then I'm like NO i know what I'm doing is wrong but I don't know how to get out of it this. \n\nI feel like the most horrible person in the world right now. I thought oh maybe I'm just bi sexual but I have really been going insane thinking about all this, and I feel like as the days go by I might fall for this guy.

My wife and I had our 2nd boy a few months ago, and now we have two kids, both boys. Older son is 3. She became a full-time stay at home mother (we both wanted that) as soon as our first son was born. I work at a small company, with typical work hours but sometimes requiring travel (maybe 10-15%). My daily commute is about 40 minutes each way. I make around 100k and that is our only source of income.\n\nNow that's out of the way, once our 2nd boy was born I took on a lot more of the household duties to help my wife out while she and our newborn get adjusted to life. I do the dishes about 80% of the time, bathe and put to sleep our elder son 80% of the time, and cook about 75% of the time on weekends and 25% of the time during the week, just to provide a sampling. I also do all of the typical dad things like the yardwork, fixing things around the house, etc.\n\nAlso, our older son also goes to daycare twice a week for about 5 hours.\n\nI don't mind doing the extra work, I really don't. But my wife often complains about all the work she does, or that she is overwhelmed. She also gets upset if I stay an extra 15 or 30 minutes at work. It's her complaining that bothers me, since I feel like I've taken a lot off her plate in order to let her focus on our newborn. When I've mentioned to her that her complaining bothers me, since we're both working more than we've ever had to, but then she gets upset that I'm not providing her a safe place to express herself.\n\nRedditors who have kids (especially multiple), do you think she has a poor work ethic? Or am I being too hard on her and need to let her complain as much as she likes?\nTL;DR:"}

Everyone insists that it's over and that I should move on and I've had an internal struggle between accepting it and maintaining hope.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Car loan is about to be paid off. What should I do with the credit union checking account?\nPOST: Long story, but I don't want to be vague:\n\nI bought a car 5 years ago. I put down a sizable down payment and the rest of the car has been paid with monthly automatic withdrawals from a local credit union that was doing great interest rates because it was the end of the year and car dealerships were trying to get rid of cars. I opened the account with that credit union specifically for this car loan. At the beginning of every month, my primary bank (which is not the one that issued the auto loan) would move $150 or so dollars from my primary checking account to the credit union checking account, but my car payment was only $140. I was letting the extra $10 accumulate every month, to about $600. I have never taken money from this account other than the automatic car payment withdrawal. So with the car being paid off, I will obviously stop the automatic transfer from my primary bank to the credit union that issued the loan. I have since moved away from the area of that credit union, so I was originally just going to transfer the $600 extra to my primary bank, but then I noticed the interest rate for the credit union checking account is 3.12% and the credit union savings account (which was created alongside the checking account for some reason) is 3.99%. This is far better than the rates at my primary bank, which makes me think I should move my real savings over to the credit union, but I live roughly 3000 miles away from the nearest branch, so I would hate to get into a situation where I need to stop in to prove my identity or something weird like that. The credit union does have a decent mobile app that would allow me to deposit checks directly to that, which is handy since I will never have direct deposit set up.\nTL;DR:"}

Anyway, this morning i woke up, got 3 missed calls and an eager voice message asking me if i'd like to go walking with him in the countryside and have a picnic.

I feel like I can be myself around him and we hit it off pretty much from the first time we met.

Not to mention several different genres.

His dad had him start the first Harry Potter book but he's eight chapters in and still complaining. The only thing I can get them to read without complaints is Diary of a Wimpy Kid; which I allowed the first two times they went through the series. Last year they loved reading and enjoyed our outings to B&N or the library; this year it's like I'm torturing them. They asked to not have to read for a timed period and instead read a certain number of pages. I agreed thinking that would be even better because I know how many pages they each read in a half hour so I could get them to read more. They seemed to like this a little better since I no longer hear \"how much longer?\" every three minutes; but they still complain about having to do it and try to talk their way out of it.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Can I [21M] ever get my mum to trust me? And how can I trust her?\nPOST: Hi guys, I really need some advice (sorry for the long post).\n\nI'm a recovered anorexia patient. I've been out of hospital and maintaining myself for over three years now. I wouldn't say that my anorexic tendencies have entirely disappeared (I doubt they ever will) I've been happy and eating healthily without much trouble for a long time.\n\nToday I got in to a stupid argument with my mum. Shopping for clothes today she suggested a pair of shorts that I might want to try on. I didn't want to, simply because I don't like to wear shorts, but she took offense. Only just now I discovered that she's convinced that I don't want to wear them because I'm concerned about my body image. This is absolutely not true (I'm quite happy with how I look now) I tried explaining this to her, but she refuses to believe me. This isn't an isolated incident, similar things have occurred before, like if I ever say I don't want to eat something it must be because I'm still anorexic. Sometimes I feel like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't: if I want to exercise it's because I'm anorexic, if I don't want to exercise it must be because I'm afraid of overexercising again.\n\nI'm posting here because I don't really have anyone I feel like I can talk to offline. My dad is overseas for the Christmas with my step-mum, although I never really speak to him that much anyway, and I don't think my brother would want to listen. My parents got divorced when I was 10, and I feel like my family has been slowly drifting further and further apart, and I don't really feel like I've ever had a male role-model in my life. My mum is really the only person I have, and I want to be able to talk to her, but I'm gradually feeling like I can less and less.\n\nIt seems like the best option might be to try and distance myself from her a little, and I desperately want to move out of home, but I won't be able to for at least another year.\n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

The first 2 years were amazing but I felt a decrease emotionally in the last three years.\n\nOur situation is a little special since here parents don't approve our relationship (mother knows, father doesn't want to know), which is why we had a crisis the last few months (was very close to breakup).\n\nThere are a few reasons why I'd consider a breakup, mainly because I expect certain things from her which she doesn't do, e.g. read books,watch less tv,do something against it if your job/hobby/friends are annoying.\n\nNow my question is: Am I an ass by asking those things from her? Can I expect her to change because I want her to be better? I'd like to think that the changes are all positive.\n\nOne would think that it is wrong to ask something like that of the person you love, but I always think that I'd do the same if she asked me to change certain things (she doesn't, and of course I'm aware that I'm not perfect).\n\nAs stupid as it sounds, I'd be more attracted to her if she were a little more intellectual than she is (not that she's dumb, but she's just not interested in books and lacks some curiosity, which I miss).\n\nWhen I'm considering a breakup, I'm scared that I'll always find flaws in a woman, but staying with her might make me not happy.\nTL;DR:"}

The community is wonderful and I'm so glad that I can find a good community online where many people are aiming for the same goal and can keep encouraging each other as well to do so :)\n\nI am 19, female, 5'3\" and 155 pounds. I used to be much skinnier at around 120 at the beginning of high school (14 years of age and around the same height), but stress-eating throughout my later teens along with the freshman 15 seem to have been my downfall...\n\nI have made it a goal to lose at least 30 pounds this year in university, maybe even more if possible. It has always been humiliating standing next to friends who are much thinner than I, all still complaining about how much weight they need to lose. Also, my own significant other is tall and abnormally thin because of his fast metabolism (5'11\" to 6' weighing only 120, but he eats more than I do). Starting my 2nd year of college, I really want to change this year and feel much better about myself instead of looking in the mirror and sighing. Some of my friends have almost starved themselves and lost weight quickly, but have gained it back in the span of a few weeks. I don't want to follow in their steps...\n\nr/loseit, what's a good and effective method for me to lose weight while having a busy schedule in college with classes, studying, socializing, jobs, and volunteering? I don't drink as of now, so alcohol/beer is not a factor for me in gaining weight. Also, what are some great recipes that I can cook for myself in college this year that are quick, low-calorie, easy, and delicious?\n\nThank you guys so much :)\n\nGood luck to everyone else as well!\nTL;DR:"}

We talk about all kinds of things, not just work. We first met in July last year, we gradually talked about stuff other than work. \n\nWe share a lot of the same interests, same music and same outlook on life generally really.

She's seeing someone at the moment but it seems to be a casual thing, I don't ask about it. \n\nIf she was in the same office I'd definitely show that I'm interested in her, just to see what happens. \n\nAs it stands though I don't really know what to do.. whether I should say something, ask to meet, just carry on as normal or forget about it all together. Is it even worth saying anything bearing in mind the distance? Maybe I'm misreading the whole situation and she's not interested. What are your thoughts? :)\nTL;DR:"}

I got up after only about 3 hours of sleep, feeling rather shitty. My wife and brother-in-law were prepping the house for the Halloween party we had planned, and I was tasked with making the sweet tea. Nothing to difficult, as I'm the designated sweet tea brewer most of the time. I set about making the tea, and my wife tells me to use the glass dispensers we had been gifted for our wedding. \n\nThis is where I made a series of stupid mistakes.\n\nThe tea reached boiling point, so I took it off the stove and set it aside to steep for a few minutes. I left the kitchen to go to the bathroom, came back and forgot to pour ice in the dispenser. I also forgot that one of the two dispensers had a fine crack toward the bottom, near the nozzle. \n\nI poured the hot tea into the cracked dispenser, and heard a resounding CRACK! Thinking I had bounced the pot off the rim, I stopped to check things out. Deciding all was well, I filled the remainder of the dispenser with water and finally noticed a small puddle of tea forming around the bottom of the dispenser.\n\nRealizing what had happened, I lifted the dispenser to move it into the sink and was soaked from the waist down in hot tea, flooding the counter, stove and floor in the process. The hairline crack near the nozzle had spread all the way around the bottom of the dispenser, so when I tried to move it, the bottom stayed put while the rest of the glass came free in my hands.\nTL;DR:"}

Let's call her Lady. We were both in a relationship back then but recently we decided to catch up. Instant connection. We began to be intimate as we began to get to know each other on a much more personal level. We both accept we are only dating and not in a relationship, but something I recently found out troubled me and I confronted her about it. \n\nAs I have told her, I know we aren't in a relationship and even if we were, I have no right to control her actions or who her friends are. I found out she she is still seeing a guy who she was a sexual partner with weeks before me. That part doesn't disturb and I do not want to make an assumption she is sexually active with him. Also because I don't have knowledge of their past or friendship. What disturbs me more is that she does various types of drugs and narcotics with him. She does more than weed and shrooms, I never got the full details of all she does and I don't think I would want to know. See the problem is this conflicts with my morality, because I wouldn't want her to be the mother of my children with that morality to raise them, not to mention she is putting herself in an unhealthy situation.  \n\nWe got into a argument because I told her simply it makes me uncomfortable she does this. I've offered to help but that only made matters worse. I've also realized I can't fix people nor am I saying she needs fixing. It simply conflicts with my morality and attraction in a woman. Looks currently as though our friendship is coming to an end. Reddit, am I wrong for being bothered? Am I wrong for letting her choose that lifestyle instead of imposing on giving her help? I offered but it made matters worse.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [Update] Me [26 M] in a long distance grey area friendship with [22F] for a few months and unsure where I stand.\nPOST: Original Post: \n\nSo I've been stewing over this for about a week, but I ended up finding out from her that she's dating someone. The way she expressed it in the past is that dating maybe leads to a relationship. When she told me that she was dating someone, she made it clear that they aren't together and that they're just going on dates. She also avoided it at first because she didn't want me to hate her.\n\nNot that I'm saying that I should be waiting, but I generally don't do the dating thing myself. It sounds like she's potentially doing this casually to get back into the swing of things? Then again, she said they maybe lead to relationships. Either way, I ended up floating the idea of non-exclusive dating to see if she was okay with that between us, but she got really upset. I ended up talking to her a few days after that (she let me know she was upset then) so I ended up dropping the conversation. I talked to her once more, she dropped that conversation and I've not talked to her since.\n\nSo, yeah, that's more or less it. I'm somewhat frustrated that she's being inconsistent and that she's now decided on dating despite telling me otherwise that she wanted to do whatever. I'm also somewhat upset because I feel a bit led on, but otherwise I don't know how viable this is in the future (even though she has admitted to liking me). Not sure what advice to ask for, but if you have any thoughts I definitely will read them.\nTL;DR:"}

Is he selfish in bed or just clueless?\nPOST: As the title states, we've been together for 2 months and sleeping together for maybe a month. I'm not as sexually experienced as he is, I had only had sex a total of 3 times (not number of partners) before I met him so this is all pretty new to me. He has had multiple long term relationships.\n\nHe has a medical condition which can sometimes make getting and staying hard difficult so I have made an effort to help him out. Usually sex starts with me giving him a blowjob. It's not my favorite thing to do but it makes him feel good and gets things going so I'm down. However, he has never gone down on me. Sex ends when he has an orgasm. I'll ask if he came but he's only asked me once if I did. I did make a mistake!! I was caught off guard when he asked this and I just said \"yes\" - it was like word vomit. So I own up to that and I know I should've been honest. But since then he hasn't asked again. I don't know if he assumes I'm having an orgasm? Or if he's just selfish?\n\nAs I mentioned above I'm not very sexually experienced. So I'm not sure how to bring this up or what to say. I've never orgasmed during sex (even before this guy) so it's not like I have a road map of how I can come during sex. I've tried to reach down and touch myself during sex to get things going but it feels very awkward and kind of gets in the way. \n\nI know I can't keep going on like this. I'm starting to get resentful that he orgasms and I don't. Once (because of his medical condition) he couldnt orgasm even after we'd had sex for awhile. So he just kind of said \"it's not gonna happen\" and we stopped. In my head I was just thinking...okay you didn't orgasm but I still can?\nTL;DR:"}

For the past few months, she has completely avoided using them, and just sent me a message or tried to do other things anytime she felt a craving for a cigarette. However, more recently she admitted to having a cigarette or two due to the stress building up on her, and she felt as though she couldn't cope.

The problem is that we've been somewhat long distance the entire duration of the relationship and I've been with him since I was 18. He was my first serious boyfriend and the only person I could have fathomed actually being with for a long period of time.\n\nI have a really bad perception of relationships and love. My parents have an awful marriage consisting of him being an abusive alcoholic who pretty much used her as a punching bag for as long as I remember. She always went back to him no matter what though, even after he nearly killed her and went to jail, she didn't press charges and is back with him now. I've been witnessing what \"love\" can do to a person since I was five years old at least, and I've never wanted to fall in love or be with anyone.\n\nThe thing is though, I don't know if I'm just freaking out about my relationship because I'm afraid of being with someone or if it's really warranted. I don't want to get married or even know if I believe in love, but this is the closest I've ever been to that. He's older, though and he's thinking about marriage so I feel like an awful human being for staying in a relationship I'm not sure about when he's pretty much head over heels, and such an amazing guy to boot.\n\nI'm just confused about how to talk to him about all of this, I feel like I jumped into this relationship so fast when I was so young that I never got to really know myself and now I don't know who I am without him.

Any and all feedback/criticism are welcome!! \n\nI was a college athlete who gained about 40lbs in college due to (obviously some drinking) but mainly, it was the first time I ever had a regimented weight lifting program and was trying to add mass. I maintained a weight of 210-215 from my soph year until I was about a year out of college (2012 graduate). Since then, I have been gaining about 5lbs a year steadily to put me at my current 230-235lbs. I have definitely started to notice changes in my stamina, breathing and overall wellness. That is what I view as my call to arms. \n\nPersonally, I think the weight gain is a combination of bad eating habits as well as a general decline in the amount of physical activity I get in my life.

Not a great recipe. \n\nTo the goals, I would like to get down to atleast the 215 I was in college, but think 200-205 is attainable and healthier (I am just under 6'1, tree trunks for legs).

I say pretty much because there have been a couple times where I have gone back to look but I do not intend to do so again. Not only for legal reasons but also for personal reasons (I do not want to develop a \"fetish\" for that shit) and ethical reasons (most underage stuff is produced by sexually abusive situations). \n\nIt doesn't really appeal to me much anymore, and it's definitely not something I look at now, but the fact that it is something in my past makes me feel very weird every time I hear/read about pedophiles. I can't help but think that they are just people who are deep into an illegal \"fetish\" and are demonized and can't get the help they so desperately need. \n\nI know my situation is a very unique one, and I'm glad I stopped. I still sometimes sexualize teenagers and it makes me sick to my stomach (I'm in my mid-twenties)...  This has been a constant burden that I've been holding onto I guess ever since I turned 18. I don't feel like I can tell anyone about my past in terms of porn.  It just felt so wrong to look at adults when I was a kid. I don't even know how to describe it. Luckily I now have an appreciation for the adult female form (trans-acceptance anyone?). \n\nI was weary of even posting this simply because of the legal ramifications, since this is of course a complete admission of guilt.  I feel like I just need someone to say something along the lines of \"in your circumstance it isn't unreasonable for you to want to have looked at underage porn at that time\".

She wasn't on a leash.  This time unusually she ran across the street to sniff out a raccoon or something else. I grabbed the flashlight and shined it on the dog. All of a sudden a car drove by and she started chasing after it. My buddies dog is no greyhound but she sure can keep up with a car. I started yelling for the car to stop while shining the flashlight onto the dog while my buddy chased after the dog. As soon as the car went around the corner we heard the dog start to whine. The guy who was driving turned the car around and drove back up the street. Apparently he lived 3 doors down, so when we approached him we didn't say a thing and he started yapping and raising his voice. After calmly asking him for his side of the story we obviously knew he was drinking a little bit but decided not to do anything that night because we had to take the dog to the hospital to fix her broken leg. We didn't get home until 3 in the morning with dog's surgery now pending and my friend stuck with a bill between 1500 to 2400. \n\nWhen the guy told his story a few things that I heard bothered me. When I told him it looked like he was speeding he said that he was doing 20 to 25 but wasn't sure. This bothered me because who speeds or at least goes the speed limit in a neighborhood. Secondly before the turn there is a sign that says \"15 mph\" through turn. The other thing that disturbed me was he said \"I didn't know if I hit a person or an animal\". My question is why wouldn't you stop if you thought you hit something, instead of driving to the end of the street and then turning around without stopping for any concern of what your vehicle hit.\n\nI really don't know if we have a case against this guy since the dog wasn't on a leash or I should file a police report regardless?\nTL;DR:"}

At first when she described him to me prior, their relationship being toxic, and he sounded like a terrible person. He was physically and mentally abusive, an extreme alcoholic (drinking from morning until night), and broke up with her countless times in their 6 month relationship.

She moved back home to NY, visited him a year later only to find out he was seeing someone else, so she left. She made a few remarks I don't know how to react to. \n\nShe told me (current BF of 9 months), She regrets getting an abortion, she should've stayed with him and maybe this wouldn't have happened.

The issue is that I think she may have kissed someone at a festival she went to last night. I trust her entirely when shes sober, but she's very new to drinking and she comes across as naive when shes drunk, so I was sort of worried something like this might happen. \n\nI'm wondering if this is enough to show the relationship is going nowhere, or if it still has potential. I know it's only two months, but it's going great and it felt like it could be a really long-term thing, so I don't want to throw it away without properly considering it first.\n\nOn a side note, I'm not entirely sure if she did kiss someone, and I haven't got a chance to speak to her sober yet, but I received a text from her saying \"I fucked up so massively\", then when I asked how about an hour later she responded talking about how she'd just been hit with something and she was trying to change the subject, it just came across as very non-genuine. This is kinda irrelevant to the question but if you have any insight into whether that probably means she did cheat it would be appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

I still don't know where I'll be working - they still have to send us our ward posts; I'm just enjoying my holidays at the moment.\n\nMy lifelong dream (still not sure whether it still is) was to become a doctor. I don't know if I'll be satisfied for years to come working as a nurse. I live in Malta where nursing resembles slightly the work of nursing aids (carers); we don't get to decide any medical plan for patients, we just give treatment or insert a catheter if instructed to. I'm afraid it's going to get boring in a few years' time.\n\nI have been pondering whether I should start MD course. This is my dilemma. I'm 21 years of age, if I take (and hopefully finish) the course I would be 26 when I finish. Certain relationship goals would have to be met between free time and studying. I don't really have much money, so that would render a slight problem (although courses in Malta are free). On the other hand, I've seen doctor's live, although exciting (at times) they don't have that much amount of free time (little to spend with family and friends); they still need to keep studying to advice on.

With my girlfriends, for an important relationship event, I would make a sketch for them. For example, after my last girlfriend's father died I drew a picture of her and him when she was little. The other sketch I made was a large portrait for my first girlfriend for our first anniversary. \n\nThe thing is, for the big sketches I did for my ex-girlfriends I spent like 40+ hours on it each. And the worst part of it all is that they are no longer in my life anymore. When I initially made the sketches for them, I truly thought the relationships would end in marriage. Now, I feel stupid and used after making the sketches for them. Especially considering how the relationships ended.  \n\nCue current problem. I am now dating a girl and she loves my artistic side, which is great. She wanted me to draw her so she took some pictures with her friends and I ended up making a relatively quick sketch for her. She loved it\u2026 then she found out about the sketches I made for my ex-girlfriends\u2026 \n\nSince then my relationship pretty much flipped on its head where she starts asking about my ex-girlfriends, as in what made them so special and if I really did love them.

She is my wife, b) she does the same for me.

My girlfriend and I have been together 8 years and over this past summer she had an emotional affair with an older woman. It felt incredibly awful. She said very romantic and loving things to and about this woman and it made me feel worthless as a partner. She claimed to have felt passion for her that she hadn't felt for me in years. It was allegedly a mutual thing but only to a certain extent; the other woman does enjoy women sexually but claims that she can never possibly love a woman romantically.\n\nThough it was tumultuous and we did briefly separate after my discovering these feelings, we have since decided to repair our relationship and get couples counseling. My GF now claims that anything she thought she felt for this woman was 'not real,' but I'm not quick to believe that honestly. She wants to be friends with this woman as what they have now is merely platonic; but for some reason I am a bit uncomfortable with the idea of them spending time alone. They text often on a daily basis and that does not bother me at all. I would be more than willing to compromise with her in that we can all hang out together; but something about the two of them spending any time together alone makes me very nervous still (the affair ended in December). \n\nI don't want to be controlling or make her feel that she cannot be friends with whomever she pleases.

This morning, I woke up to go to a lab class and found my car missing from the parking lot, from my designated spot. I called the police and found out that my car was at a tow company and that they had towed my car because it appeared that my tag registration had expired. Really, I had lost the sticker or had it stolen a couple months back and didn't pay the 50$ fee to get it replaced. I asked to have a civil officer accompany me to the impound to get my car, because in my eyes, impounding a car for no reason is stealing a car. \nWe went to the impound and the cop told me that what the tow company was doing was a form of legal extortion and even ran the plates in front of them to prove that they're valid. The cop also told me that even the police wouldn't have the authority to tow a car for invalid plates without first running the plates. So now the tow company wants to charge 330$ for my car back. I sobbingly told them that I don't have any money and am in college and have no income right now and they told me that if I can fork over 175 by 5 PM, they would give me the car. I don't understand how or if this is legal. I have an appointment to speak with a campus attorney tomorrow but was hoping someone here could help me out. Also, it's worth mentioning that I didn't think that the lack of appearance of valid tags would cause me to be towed because me neighbors have a car that straight up has no plates at all and an illegal tint, but that cat was passed over last night by the tow truck driver. When I asked why, he told me that there was a special arrangement with the property managers to let this car park here.\nTL;DR:"}

With that said... \n\nSo I am currently an at home mom. I have gained about ten pounds since my last day of work (Most likely more).  My son got a bike about three weeks ago, the second day he went two miles and loved it and was furious when I admitted I was lost and we needed to go home. I love to follow behind him on my roller blades. Yesterday I got the idea to make it a daily thing to go at least a mile and try and loose some weight. \n\nAs I am following behind my little one and sweating up a storm I started wondering how good this is for him. If we are pushing ourselves so hard that I am loosing weight is it ok for him? He loves the bike rides and the time we spend together doing so. I would never push him harder than he could handle, except for telling him that he needs to get himself home and I won't carry him, it has never come up yet. \n\nOn top of this the easter bunny got him a life jacket/ swim suit. So I want to incorporate that into our biking activities. The exercise he would get at the pool is a lot more than me, I just want to do it because he likes it and it cools me off. So that raised a small concern also. \n\nI know some of this community is so sedentary that I have seen concerns over doing things for more than an hour. If this is you, I don't want your opinion. If you have a super active child, please tell me what you think. As I am typing this up I feel a little silly and am rationalizing different metabolisms and things of that nature. I would love some outside opinions though. thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

We decide to start a relationship and I ask her to go to prom. \n\n**HERE COMES THE FUCK UP:**\n\nThe day of prom, I put on my tux and look in the mirror. I look like fucking James Bond about to go to a swanky cocktail party. Brimming with confidence, I could have made ScarJo blush. I pick her up, and she's wearing a killer green dress. I'm on my game and things are going swimmingly. So, we get to prom and we are waiting in line for pictures.

I suffered throughout the relationship - I started dating him because I was looking for attention and wasn't attracted to him, and when I wanted to break up with him he manipulated me emotionally, crying and begging me to stay with him, telling me he thought no one could love him until I came into his life etc...and it dragged on and on until I couldn't keep lying to myself and eventually broke up with him.\n\nFor the past year I've been very happy by myself - I'm honestly not actively searching for a relationship. I am, however, looking for a FWB.\n\nI started talking to someone (M32) online, and he's pretty amazing. He fits my sexual needs(BDSM), he makes me smile and laugh and I find myself thinking about him often both in a sexual and a romantic way. He said he thinks about me in the same way.\n\nHe wants to meet me but I'm not sure what I want from him - on the one hand I like him and think we could be a good match, but on the other hand I feel completely emotionally unprepared for a relationship - I cringe at the thought of the past two years with my ex and I think I would just fuck it up with the new guy.  \nI can't even imagine having to talk to someone daily, supporting them and meeting on a regular basis. It sounds harsh but my last relationship was somewhat of a nightmare to me - My ex loved to victimize himself and I still feel drained and unable to take that sort of thing again.\n\nI don't want to hurt him and I'm not sure what to do.  \nI also have no idea how to start getting past this.

I feel insecure.\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year. We're both fairly introverted people and enjoy our alone time. We see each other a few days a week. Usually if it's a week night and we don't have actual date plans we won't meet up until later in the evening so he has time to decompress from work. I probably initiate requests to hang out slightly more than he does, but it doesn't feel like a big difference and I don't doubt that he enjoys my company.\n\nI've never thought this was an issue until recently when I learned about his college relationship from a mutual friend. We all attended a university where it's common to move off campus after a year or two. It turns out that my boyfriend lived with his college girlfriend for three years: one where she slept in his single every night while they were still in the dorms, and two more when they moved into an apartment with some friends and shared a bedroom.\n\nI've never lived with an SO. He and I have discussed living together eventually as a part of discussions about the future, but it's not something we're planning on any time soon. I've always thought of him as someone who needed his me-time and was perfectly okay with this, but now I can't reconcile that with the discovery that he was basically inseparable from his college girlfriend. \n\nDoes this mean that he's just not that into me, or can people change that much? Is this something that I should talk to him about, and if so, how? I'm very happy with the amount we see each other, but I've always assumed that this is just how he is. Learning that he used to crave much more time with an SO is making me feel inadequate and insecure. \n\nShould I chalk it up to him growing up, or take it as a sign that his feelings might not be as strong as I thought?\nTL;DR:"}

I have been hanging out with her since March, usually a couple times a week. We always had a really good time, and I interpreted her light touches and playful chiding as interested in me, which is upsetting because I only allowed myself to become emotionally invested because I thought she was genuinely interested in me romantically.\n\nIt's got me wondering, what's wrong with me? I had two proper girlfriends in high school. And while the first was crazy and an awful relationship, the second one and I cared about each other very deeply and only broke up because we moved away from each other. However, since then, I've had almost no luck with girls. A couple drunken hookups (regret), a couple short-term flings that were enjoyable but neither of us were serious about, and now this last girl.\n\nI don't know why I can't make it work with any girl I meet. I'm a pretty put together guy. I have a great job and am good with money. Obviously this is subjective, but I think I dress pretty decently. I have hobbies and a lot topics I love discussing passionately. I'm pretty gregarious and make friends really easily, both casual friends and deeper more meaningful friendships. A lot of girls seem to sincerely enjoy being friends with me.\n\nBut I can never turn all these things that work out for me socially in so many ways into something that works out for me romantically. A part of me wonders if I'm just not attractive enough, especially now that my hair has started to thin, but when I'm honest with myself, I just don't think I'm so repulsive that it \"makes sense\" that I'd have gotten so little female attention over the last 5-6 years.\n\nWhen I read advice for people in my situation, the advice is always get a hobby, get out of the house more, or to get into shape or whatever else, but I feel like I've done all of that.

If we were in the same city this would be an amazing relationship but it's just not sustainable and too emotionally draining for the stage of the relationship we're in. I mean I couldn't believe the connection I had with her. So we decided to stop this thing before it got any worse.

I was unconsoleable for a while, but thanks to my amazing mom, I realized maybe it was for the best. He isnt as outgoing and not as smart and has virtually no friends besides me. Three weeks later, after I had finally decided I was over him and could do better, he texts me, begging me to talk to him. I do, and one thing led to another and we got back together. \n\nEverything was fine and felt like it did before we broke up, for a while. A month or so ago I realized this was not what I wanted. I love him, and think he's a great guy and a good boyfriend, but I wasn't in love with him anymore. I've been acting like everything is normal, but I definitely pulled away. I didn't want to break up with him right after school because he was in summer school and in our college town all by himself with no friends to talk to. I felt responsible for him and didn't want him to be all alone.\n\nRecently, he noticed how distant I was being and I finally broke down and told him that I was having doubts about our relationship. He was definitely hurt and told me he wasn't going to wait forever for me to make up my mind. Which I totally don't blame him for. I'm dragging this out when I shouldn't be because I don't want to hurt him.\n\n He gave me a week to make up my mind. I have until tomorrow.

When I do, I make simple comments and I am just too annoyed at what she is now to talk to her. She is in and out of relationships with guys who treat her like shit and I am disgusted of her. I used to feel bad for her but I no longer do. I blame everything on her, but I know that's not right. She has been in and out of rehab, she has stolen from our family for drugs, and she never answers my texts when I'm at school (in a different city). The only time she calls me is when she's fucked up at 3 in the morning. And I never answer that.\n\nMy brother has started having drinking problems. He is married and he and his wife have been in arguments for it. She even moved out for awhile because of it. I am very close to my brother, but we still never talk about it.. Only once. I am the youngest but I see them both as fucking babies right now. My mom just went over to my brother's house to help sort shit out because apparently he's drunk. \n\nBut despite all of my hatred of where they are going, I can't reach out to them. Although I am the youngest, I am the most social and understanding one in the family. I see myself as the baby of the family who could fix everything by reaching out and actually helping, but I can't make myself do it. I am too disgusted with them. And I beat myself up over it. I have become distant from my family because of all of this shit. I am sick of having such a fucked up family. \n\nI just need some advice. I want to help, but at the same time I don't want to have anything to do with them. I beat myself up over it while simultaneously hating them for what they are doing to themselves.

Low weight, short, and not as verbal as I was told he should be...\nPOST: My son just turned 2 in June. He is a smart little booger and keeps us on our toes. I always thought he was perfect until I went to his 18 month check-up and was told he was too small and that he should be talking more. After that appointment, I started comparing him to other toddlers his age and realized he was behind. He communicates in all ways possible except not much verbally. Momma, Daddy, Nana, yes, this, and don't are all he says, though I feel this is just due to us giving in to what we know he is trying to say. I am not worried so much about his talking as I am about his weight... at 25 months he is a tiny 22-23 lbs! He was 19-20 lbs at a year :-( Other toddlers his age are at or around 30 lbs. \n\nWe have been struggling to get him to eat. He nibbles and picks at his food. He is very picky about textures and won't eat anything slimy, mushy, or anything strange in general. Even if I make his favorite foods (which really has hardly any nutritional value like mac n' cheese or pancakes) he eats so little it stresses me out! I don't force him to eat and let him come back later if he decides he is hungry to nibble on it some more. We always make sure he eats with us, and if we are eating outside of the normal meal time, he will munch on what we are having as long as he likes it. His regular babysitter makes sure he eats eggs, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, and a protein shake to help with his weight but even that doesn't seem to be helping. Am I going about this all wrong? Any tips and suggestions are much appreciated! We were told to enroll him in an Early Learning program for his speech, but I think we will wait on that until he is closer to 3. I am mostly concerned about his weight.\nTL;DR:"}

However, this changed about 2 years ago, shortly after my fianc\u00e9 and I officially got together. My parents announced they were getting a divorce after being married for 20 years. I was not living at home anymore and this came as a pretty big shock, since while they had problems in the past I thought things were going well between them (they were taking vacations together, exercising, etc.)\n\nOverall this hasn't affected my life in any major ways, I had a few cries about it early on and since then have been fine. BF has been great through everything too. I've felt like he was the one since about 6 months into our relationship, and I love him more than anything. I'm super excited to get married and spend our life together! Our few problems have been one time events, and handled successfully and maturely. I think we communicate really well.\n\nI know I 100% want to be married with him, but sometimes I find myself questioning if you can ever REALLY know... Surely my parents thought they \"knew\", right? But 20 years later it all fell apart. I'm terrified that this could happen to us too. I feel like my parents getting divorced ripped away all the belief I had that marriages can last forever. His parents are still married, but it's still his dads second marriage :/\n\nSo my question is how can I keep my brain from thinking these stupid thoughts?

We recently left our 3.5 year-old Berner for a week at PetSmart while we visited family. He goes there all the time for day care and has stayed there overnight 3-4 days before, but this is the longest he has ever boarded. As soon as he came home on Sunday 11/3 he began vomiting water up. Monday AM 11/4 he refused to eat (VERY unlike him - he lives for food... I can't stress that enough) and every time he drinks even a little - 4 ice cubes and 4-5 oz of water - he vomits everywhere. The vomit is usually yellow. We called PetSmart and they said to keep an eye on him and not worry. Tuesday 11/5 (yesterday) he was doing the same thing and becoming lethargic, so we took him to the vet. She did an Xray to see if there was anything blocking or any inflammation, everything's good. Due to limited funding, we did the xray instead of blood work per the doctors advice that she would still treat the symptoms without blood work. Gave him a Liter of fluid under the skin, anti-nausea shot, and a few antibiotics in case of GI issues (which he can't eat... because he won't eat...). Last night he was keeping down some water and was a little more alert. Today 11/6 in the middle of the night he vomited three more times, still won't eat, and we're still out of money.\n\nI believe he is very upset about being boarded (he is a VERY emotional dog), but we are worried he will die before we can get enough money to help him.\nSome helpful information:\nHis last check up before this was about 5 months ago, and he was great, is up to date on all his shots, etc.\nHe has no history, besides some food allergies and we ruled that out already.\nHe never eats foreign bodies.\nHis records indicate he did very well in boarding and ate Sunday morning great, no vomiting, and no diarrhea his entire stay at boarding.\nTL;DR:"}

She started dating early into that time but he didn't.\n\nSince then, he spent a while going on dates through eHarmony but still had quite a few changes going on in his life - finding a new flat, changing jobs etc and ended up stopping. He's now quite down and I know the fact that he's single and hasn't had sex in years is really getting him down.\n\nWhat can I do to help him? My own dating experience is minimal and dated - I've only had three 'proper' girlfriends myself and have been with my (now) wife for 11 years. I never did the whole going to pubs/bars/clubs to hit on girls.\n\nI know it sounds bad but I really think it would do him a world of good to get laid and would massively boost his confidence. He's not bad looking, is very intelligent, funny, earns well and owns his own flat. He's an introvert and lacks confidence. What can I do? I or my wife don't know anyone we could set him up with and the other guys in our social group are all gay so there are no potential wing-men.\nTL;DR:"}

I have been to a few jewlers and looked at rings and I have an idea, but the timeline just doesnt fit for what she wants and what I want to give her.  \n\nOne of the things that is so great about her is how she just accepts my humor despite how crude it can be at times.  One of the jokes I have kept going is I keep telling her I am going to propose to her with a ring from one of those quarter egg machines or something from a flee market.  \n\nSo here is my conundrum, in order to get the ring I want and that she likes it is going to take time, time we dont really have. I could very easily go find something I can walk out of the store with but everything I have seen thus far isnt the right one.  If I just keep looking, am I likely going to find the right one that I can walk out with?  \n\nOr, can i propose with a fake ring from a flee market or quarter machine with the intentions that two of us will go together to get the right ring without having to postpone the engagement?

Our relationship isn't at all in jeopardy but I have noticed this rising resentment and would like to address it if I can.\n\nBefore we were even married I had made it clear that I absolutely hate cooking. I hate everything about getting or providing food. I expressed that I would have the expectation that she handle everything from beginning to end regarding food. If I could survive without ever eating I would but I can't.\n\nI know that sounds bad but I more than made up for it. I told her I would do every household chore she asked me to do. I'd do all the laundry. I would do nearly everything around the house and the only thing I wanted nothing to with was food. I don't even mind if she doesn't cook something. I'll just make myself a bowl of cereal as long as she had done the shopping.\n\nThis has worked pretty well for 7 years but I can sense a rising resentment in her that she always has to worry about the food. Nothing serious. No ultimatums, just comments here and there that make it clear she's unhappy with the food situation.\n\nI'm not quite certain how to address this yet. It kind of irritates me because I handle so much other stuff around the house I really don't feel like what I've asked for is unreasonable. I will do just about *everything else* but shop for food and cook.\n\nI don't think she feels overworked. She works part time. So it must be something else.

There was a queue of people behind me now so I was shoving and pushing my bag harder and harder so I could finally get to my seat.

However, I want to save significantly beyond that.\n\nMy current combined tax rate works out to ~14%, so I'm looking at putting my money into a Roth IRA. However, I'm really clueless about what to do beyond the $5500 maximum I can put into the IRA.

The interview itself went extremely well. I showed up about 12 minutes early and sat down with the store manager directly for about 25-30 minutes. There was regular chit chat and laughing. She then set up a secondary interview with the District Manager over FaceTime for the next day. I then sent her a thank you email at the end of the day. \n\nThis second interview went what I believe to be extraordinarily well. It took about 60 minutes (though she was 40 minutes late calling me)  and most of it was personal conversation, basic resume questions, and the regular run of the mill questions which I feel as if I aced. \n\nAfter the interview I called the store manager as per her instruction and she said she'll check my references and get back to me. \n\nA single days passes and she says everything checked out she just wants me to come in for a \"third interview\" to answer some additional questions. \n\nWhen I showed up 15 minutes early for the third interview the store was chaotic. Apparently they had just had a large theft and she made me wait about twenty minutes. While she's rather personable and friendly, her tone was a bit more on the strict and questioning side. She asked me about my former job and kinda drilled me on it. She seemed overall happy but I was a little taken off by the switch in gear. \n\nShe told me to wait about 48 hours to hear back on whether or not the uppers will extend the job and I heard the dreaded \"I'm looking to get more payroll\" claim.

Weird. But I am not a clingy guy so I dont pester her, I just wont double text.

She suddenly did.\n\nIts a bunch of little things I fear will lead to a breakup. In general, I feel she doesnt appreciate me enough. Of course I have thought of talking to her, but as weird as it sounds, I feel like thats very clingy. I want to tell her to appreciate me more, but thats not the right course of action because appreciating someone cant be forced.\n\nI really feel like shes losing interest and I know from experience that putting more effort into a relationship may be counterproductive as it smothers her.

A new capacitor wasn't that much more, so I figured \"sure, why not\".\n\nLast night I went to do the replacing, and that's when I realized that the bad fan motor had 1 wire that goes to the capacitor, but the new motor has 2.  The only thing is, there's only room on the capacitor for one wire to be connected (from the fan motor).  My logic is, if they both attach at the same place, why can't I just splice them together into one connector and attach them both at the same time to the capacitor.\n\nI'm not sure if that is the source of error, or there's something else...but when I plugged the fuse back in to start everything up there was sparking and the smell of electrical burning.\n\nTomorrow an A/C repairman will be coming out to fix everything.\nTL;DR:"}

I was a little uncomfortable with this, and asked him to put me in contact with someone from HR directly, citing my concern for my security. Quoting his response e-mail directly: \n\n\"I completely understand. I upload the background directly myself so it will not go to anyone else. I also upload the documentation into your profile on our HR system as well.\"\n\nThe manager has also been a bit difficult to reliably contact.

I told Jay that I couldn't have it in the house or around me but he's been so stubborn on having it everywhere since he loves to drink. It's made such a huge mess, him saying that I'm trying to control him, that I'm acting like an ex, etc etc just because I don't want alcohol in the house. He knows how easily addicted I get from almost anything yet is willing to wave all of that nasty poison in my face on a day to day basis without thinking of the repercussions. \nI've always beat temptations by not having myself around them and I don't know whether I should give up on this or not. \nTell me reddit; am I being a crazy psycho bitch girlfriend and just apologize or should I keep fighting it?

We broke up because I wasn't ready to settle down yet and felt we were becoming too wrapped up in each other while I was trying to finish undergrad and he'd just started grad school. He was really hurt although he handled the breakup very gracefully.

We reconnected towards the end of that relationship. \n\nA few weeks after I ended things with the other guy, we decided to give our relationship another shot. I'd missed him terribly during our period of no contact and was thrilled he was willing to give me another chance, now that I have more maturity and life experience under my belt.

All the stuff you're supposed to do when getting back together with an ex.\n\nI just can't shake the feeling that this moved too fast. I love him, he's my best friend, we click on so many levels and I can honestly see myself marrying him someday (which he's also expressed).

At the time we decided to revisit it later (this was about 6 months ago) and it's been somewhat bugging me ever since. \n\nWe're both seniors, and while we have a great relationship otherwise, to me I feel like I'm asking what we're even doing if we have such a non-negotiable difference. What I'm somewhat worried about is that when I bring it up again, she'll continue to be ambiguous about it, or still isn't sure. What should I do in that case? The longer we're together the harder it will be to end things later, and if we want different things we're essentially wasting both of our time.

Although I may be selfish for this, I would like my own kids, but I thought her stance on adoption to be rather telling of her overall feeling \n\nI know she's not going to want to break up. When we talked about it before she thought we could look back into the topic a year or two from now, so I know she isn't expecting a serious conversation about it so soon.

I don't want to cheat on anyone, and I don't want to be someone used on the side and lead on.

But this guy was all over the road. So I think to myself I should probably call the cops. But I dont. Instead I think it will be funny to freak this guy out and make him realize how obviously impaired he is. So before I turn off to pick up some pizza for the family i flash my lights on and off real quick. And then turn off and pick up my food. I get my food and get back in the car pull out and see that this guy just ran in to the back of the car in front of him and the cops were already having him do sobriety test.... Now it would be easy to say I had nothing to do with it but I'm sure my lights had that guy freaked out he was freaking out watching my vehicle and hit the car in front. In hindsight I should not have done that I could have got someone seriously injured but luckily everyone was OK.\nTL;DR:"}

Are friends with benefits now or what ?\nPOST: Using a throw away obviously. Last days have been hectic and sorry for the long post.\nBackground: Me and my ex have been together for 8 months until August. We broke up because he left for college in another country and we didn't want to pursue a LDR. We got along pretty well , we were both stubborn but we always managed to resolve our conflicts. I can say that what we had was special , and the break up was hard but it was for the best. \n\nAfter we broke up we remained friends and still are. We talk almost every day, about everything, he is always there to listen and we are almost like best friends.\nWe ask each other for advices in the matter of dating and nothing it's weird and there are no hard feelings. \n\nNow onto the problem: He came this weekend in the town I'm currently studying for the weekend. He missed his friends and he hasn't been in the country since August. He slept at my place. Before he came we talked about what would happen when he came, and we got to the conclusion that if neither of us had a girlfriend/boyfriend we would sleep together, mess around like old times. There was always attraction between us and the sex was always amazing so why not. \n\nWell , this past weekend we acted like we were a couple , hand holding, hugs , and we had amazing sex. Everything was going great until we asked each other what are we feeling.\nI don't know how I feel , some part of me will always love him , and he told he still loves me but not the same. I care for him , he cares for me but neither of us wants to get back together. \n\nI don't know what I feel. Is this normal ? Are going to get hurt ? He is coming home for Christmas and we all know how it's going to be. Are friends with benefits? I'm just confused about this , because it feels normal in a weird way. Hope someone can bring some light in here.\nTL;DR:"}

In rehab, at the age of 14, he was introduced to psychedelics, changing his outlook on human thought, drug use, and his place in the world. He went years without touching opiates or stimulants, instead \"traversing the eternal abyss\" with both popular and underground chemicals, everything from marijuana, acid, mushrooms and mdma to designer chemicals and shamanic substances, including 2c-i and dmt. We are now college roommates, and since freshman year he has had the occasional week-long binge with his favorite drugs; oxycontin, heroin, the like. He goes for long stretches without touching the stuff, self medicating with strange powders he finds on the internet: kava extracts and daily doses of kratom. This weekend, completely unbeknownst to myself and my friends who are mild drinkers and occasional pot smokers, my friend ordered a massive dose of oxycontin from a website and took all of it over the course of three days, blowing through hundreds of dollars. he confessed, embarrassed yet without remorse, promising he would never lie to us again.\nThis morning, I believe I walked into his room to find him ordering more. I am at a loss for actions and words, and I don't know where to find information on how to help him deal with his problems.\nReddit: have you ever had to deal with opiate addicts?

We broke up quite amicably a few years ago when we ended up in cities thousands of miles apart and neither of us wanted to do long-distance indefinitely. While we're both single, we tend to be in contact a lot, and quite flirty.\n\nBecause I had some savings I could afford to spend, and plenty of annual leave to take, I decided to go visit her this summer. I'll be going about a month from now. I don't want to sound presumptuous, but it's very likely that we're going to be physically intimate.\n\nThe thing is, I've developed extensive psoriasis in the last six months. It started off a few years ago with some patches on my arms, which Jane has seen. I've told her it's gotten worse since then, but I think she doesn't understand just how bad it is. It's really fucking bad. My whole torso looks like it's rotting. I'm disgusted by it, and I can't bear to take my shirt off around anybody. I can't even look at myself in the mirror.\n\nI was Skyping with Jane yesterday, and between one thing and another, she ended up in her underwear. She looked amazing, perfect. In comparison, I look horrific.\n\nI've been waiting for months for an appointment with a dermatologist. That won't be until a week before I go to visit Jane, so I doubt that there's going to be some miracle cure.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how I can give her a reasonable warning about just how bad this is.

At the clinic, they couldn't find the fetus via ultrasound, which means that I either had a miscarriage without noticing/bleeding (and the tests still show positive) or I have an ectopic pregnancy. I have a couple more urgent appointments to figure this out this week--and they're actually not scheduled yet! I have to call radiology tomorrow morning--so that will require being late to work at an indeterminate time, or, if I do have an ectopic pregnancy, missing a couple days or longer.\n\nHow do I tell my boss? She is very nice and understanding, but this is an intimate issue. I really don't mind if she knows  about it (in fact, that might make it less awkward for me), but I don't know if it's appropriate to tell her. How vague or explicit should I be in my email? How do I handle the fact that I have no idea how many days (or when) I will miss work? In addition, this is a very busy week with a few important, long-awaited meetings and I feel really bad.

She suggested that we try texting less. \n\nI'm having a harder time with this. I used to text him quite a lot during the day Now I've cut it down to just a few texts during the day. I don't message him with very time-absorbing or attention-absorbing content...just little affectionate things. We don't see each other a lot during the day. Our work schedules are pretty different. That is part of why I want him to respond to these little texts. I want connection during the day. However, he tells me, basically, that \"work is work\" and \"home is home\". He wants strictly \"business texts\" if he's at work.\n\nThe thing is, when I get home, he is usually getting ready for bed. He's been complaining about not getting enough sleep...because of me. Because I get home late and want to spend time together. We've talked about this before. We both agreed to spend at least 30 minutes a night of Quality Time. Apparently quality time is eating into his sleep schedule, though.\n\nI feel like I'm in his way rather than being a part of his life. But I'm also getting the feeling that I might just be clingy. He has told me that it isn't that I'm \"in the way\". According to him, what it boils down to is: I want more attention than he is willing/available to give during the week. I think I need a different perspective here. Should I just bite the bullet during the week and then try to enjoy my time with him on the weekend? Or...eh, I'm not sure what else.\nTL;DR:"}

She doesn't think there's anything wrong with the way she looks or that doctors say she has weeks to live. She's gone to every program ever, been talked to by friends, friends' moms, the works.  \n\nHas anyone ever had a friend go through this? Or themselves experienced something similar? I wish I could shake her to wake her up and see reality but I doubt that'd go over we'll. I spent most of this time away at college, now working away from home so it's not like I have physically seen her more than a few times in person in the past 6 years.  \n\nI dont know if there's anything i could say that would change her mind.  I am thinking of writing her a letter as I won't be able to see her before the expiration date. I'm not sure it would change anything, but i would say I have appreciated my time with you and if what the doctor's say is true, I will miss you and wanted to say goodbye while I can.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: First relationship, first breakup: Why am I having a way harder time than her?\nPOST: Hey Reddit, first timer here (on Reddit, and I guess in the relationship world as well.) 17M here, recently broke up with 17F after 11 months of a pretty serious relationship. (Serious to me, I realized in my other post that \"serious\" means a totally different thing to some people.)\n\nWe go to school together, and in the 2 weeks since we decided to \"take a severe break\" (I was well aware of what it actually was) she appears to have completely come to terms with what happened. Although we've had our issues over the last year, -- her being a bubbly, flirtatious girl, and me being a friendly but not-at-all-flirtatious boy with jealousy issues -- we always addressed them as they came up and continued to have a great time with each other. I've become very attached to her over the last year and I consider her one of my best friends, but I can't help but wonder just how \"emotionally invested\" in our relationship she actually was. I'm having a damn hard time with this, and she's already ready to be friends.\n\nWhat do I do? Tell her I need some space and move on without her? Or try to play the friend role, when I truly don't know how well that will work? Any advice would be wonderful, I've talked to friends about this and they don't have much advice for me. I want to be with her but I know I need this time; part of me doesn't want to take the whole risk of \"letting go\" (to be melodramatic.)\nTL;DR:"}

I've liked her since the very beginning when we met, but I never said anything. We used to be best friends until I had to move. After I moved I met another girl and started a family with her, got married, whole 9 yards. \n\nNow, I'm divorced, and with 2 kids. We started talking again, and every time we talk the old feelings come back. She's an AMAZING singer, very beautiful girl, everything a guy could ask for. We sing together and she REALLY likes that, I see her as much as I can, and I can't wait to see her again. \n\nHere's the thing, she's always told me she just needs a friend, so that's how I've been there for her. She also said that she will not date a guy that has kids already. But then she writes our initials \"heart style\" and I would like to say she drops little hints to her liking me, but maybe that's just my imagination.\n\n \n\nYesterday I broke down and, crying, called her to tell her finally after so long how I genuinely feel about her. She already knew; I guess I didn't hide my feelings very well; and I think she took it well. By the end of the conversation we were laughing instead of crying. She has that power over me that we talk, and i feel happy again. She's amazing, and I don't want to lose her ever again, even if it means being in the \"friendzone\" the rest of our lives. But every time we make contact, the same feelings come up. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

I have a bit of a problem with my relationship. As the title says, my girlfriend of 5 years is overly affectionate to me. At first, I loved it - I'd never even went out with (let alone kissed or had physical contact with :/) a girl until I met her, so the touching I got was amazing to me.\n\nEventually, it got really annoying - which kills me to say, but its true. I don't mind hand-holding in public, maybe me putting my arm around her and stuff - not kissing eachother in the local shopping center. As someone with an extreme case of social anxiety (my parents used to think I was autistic, and tbh they still do, I think...) I prefer to keep that stuff with sex, lovey-dovey talk and other touchy-feely stuff - in the privacy of our house. I thought this was normal girlfriend behavior, up until last year, when I got together with some friends and we started discussing our SOs and they told me it was weird what my girlfriend was doing.\n\nI want to tell her I don't like her constantly touching me and kissing me in public without it sounding like 'I hate how you express your love for me' and hurting her feelings or putting our relationship in jeopardy (which I can't afford to do, seeing as I just blew out a load of money on an engagement ring...). I love her and don't want to cock the relationship I've been building for 5 years with the perfect woman.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: How can I manage my (unreasonable?) anxiety?\nPOST: Having a lot of issues with my girlfriend and she left to stay the night at her mom's a few weeks ago because of how bad everything got. She's back now and we're trying to slowly work things out without overwhelmingly each other again and I keep going into panic mode and fucking everything up by being clingy. \n\nI've always had trust issues (even though she never really gave me reasons too, I'd just find inconsistencies so often I started feeling like she wasn't trying to keep my trust but I realize now I sort of pushed her into doing that) and its like they're even worse now because I'm afraid of her leaving. So now when I try to be affectionate and get shut down (or in some cases, just treated how I used to treat her without realizing) it brings me crashing down into depression and anxiety wondering if she still wants to even be around me which leads to trying to be more affectionate (cause that makes sense?) and I end up being the overly clingy boyfriend who always needs more attention. \n\nDoing all of this is making our whole situation worse and probably making her sick(er?) of me but it's so hard to not feel that way even knowing all that. It's like I can't stop myself from acting that way and it's because I can't stop feeling that way. \n\nHow do I calm down and stop worrying about our relationship, so that I can have a chance at actually fixing it?\n\nI've had anxiety like this before when I quit smoking (weed, withdrawal is noticeably worse for me than others) and she's always been there to help me deal with it (too much so, which is part of the problem) so this is even scarier and harder since I no longer have her for that. And I'm cutting back on smoking now as well just to clear my head but I know it's also contributing to the anxiety. This is probably just irrelevant information though. But I know some ways to deal with anxiety already this just seems too intense to even start any of them.\nTL;DR:"}

Our sex life was bad- I was never in the mood. We had had a few threesomes with women which I loved. We got married in July, because that's what you do. \n\nIn September, my close female friend and I went out dancing. We dance and giggled and ended up kissing all night. From that night on I couldn't be without her. We saw each other everyday.

She was married too, so we struggled.\n\nShe kicked her husband out and I moved in with her and her two kids in May. I had known her children for years so they were comfortable with me. But it was a lot of change. She has a history of depression and I guess I did too, do it was tough. One day she came home and told me she was still sleeping with her husband. She begged me to stay and said it would never happen again.\n\nI was a wreck. Trust was gone. Whenever she left the house I'd get sick, thinking she was going to him.

I was wrong. At the end of the night, I had drank the entire bottle (approximately 3 hours of drinking 10-1am, ran out at 1). No lie, WAS NOT DRUNK. WTF.

We've been through all the typical stuff all couples go through, and other things as well. Everything was pretty normal until he cheated with my best friend. I wanted things to work, so we went through counseling and it was okay for a few years. We had a child, and everything plummeted. He wanted me to be a stay at home mom and not work, but then would complain that I wasn't making any money. I could deal with his mood swings and anger, but as soon as he started swearing at our one year old, I left. \n\nWe were split for almost a year before we reconciled. I believed he had changed and I didn't really want a divorce and put our child through that. Once back together, things were okay again for about six months, and then they have gone downhill. He doesn't want to spend any time with our child (asked to be played with and he will refuse because he wants to watch tv). He is controlling and manipulative; he threatened to take me to a pshyc ward after I confessed I was mildly depressed. He also threatened to cut me off financially because I wanted to get out of the house (with our child) for a few hours. I have so much of my life invested into this relationship, and being from a divorced family, I really hate the idea of doing that to our child, but I just don't know what to do anymore. Im not sure if counseling will help or even be worth it at this point.\nTL;DR:"}

I've done a ton of research and have a pretty long list of things I want to see and do. \n\nMy biggest question is whether to rent a car (I know most people recommend) or to pay for a guided tour. \n\nRenting gives us freedom but also added stresses of planning meals, lodging, and details I'm not even aware of.

If it was just my wife and I it wouldn't be as much of a question but having the boys with us makes it more harder to answer.\n\nTour companies obviously work out a lot of those details for you can enjoy the ride rather than having to drive. They also provide educational information along the way. The downside is they have set itineraries.

A few days later, she said she'd be more interested in something more quiet, maybe we could meet at my place for drinks, call in a pizza and watch a movie.\n\nNot going to lie, I like where this is going.\n\nNow, I should say I'm not comfortable with being someone she cheats with. \nBut I do know that open relationships are a thing that couple's do, and her boyfriend may have given her his blessing to go after other guys.\n\nThe thing is, I don't know if this is the case. She could just want to hang, and see me in a platonic enough light that she can do that one on one (and I have no problem with us being friends).\n\nSo, how do I tell that she's open to, and interested in, sleeping with me? I can't just ask her 'hey, are you and your boyfriend exclusive?\", and similarly, she probably can't just drop \"oh hey, my boyfriend said I can sleep with you\". \n\nThis is some prisoner's dilemma shit right here.\nTL;DR:"}

That period has been a difficult time for me in that respect, as I had a difficult breakup (dumped by text with absolutely no warning or justification by a girl I really liked, who ended up with someone else within a week or two) and then spent several months (probably close to a year) in a really weird and probably quite unhealthy infatuation with one of my absolute best friends at the time, who rejected and 'friendzoned' (I hate that term, but I don't know what else to use) me in the nicest way possible, but then went on to start dating another of my best mates.\n\nAll of this really destroyed my self image and confidence with the opposite sex completely. Its something I've been trying to work on a little, but when I finally built up the confidence to ask a girl out a few months ago, I realized I'd totally misread the signals, and ended up having a really awkward coffee with a girl because I didn't have the confidence to make it clear that I was asking her out on a date, not just as a friend.\n\nI have a great social life otherwise, and I have plenty of (male and female) friends, but I've reached a point where I find it hard to imagine anyone finding me attractive. Physically, I'm very tall/skinny and I have long hair, and although I'm personally pretty happy with my appearance, and think I've created a style which reflects my personality well, I've convinced myself that these traits are the reason I don't seem to have any success with women.\nTL;DR:"}

I used to deliver uniforms for a living. I would go to a business, drop off their clean uniforms, pick up the dirty ones, talk to the customer about any changes, and get a signature for the invoice. \n\nThe dirty would often include underwear. Dirty used underwear. While this wasn't event close to the worst thing I came in contact with, I would often find some with residue or skid-marks. I would then leave the dirty underwear on the floor in front of the soil bin in hopes the owner would see it, realize their mistake, take care of the underwear, and never repeat it again. \n\nWell, on that day I found a particularly foul pair. Lots of dry liquidy poop. So I avoided it at all costs, bagged up the dirtys, and went up front for a signature. This user had done this before, quite a few times actually, just never this gross. \n\nI had a good relationship with most of my customers and because I was there at least once a week, we usually joked around a little bit or sometimes get into a somewhat long discussion. On that day the two women who usually sign my invoice had some questions about gross stuff we see delivering uniforms. I told them a few stories about some of the worst stuff. I didn't include the poopy underwear I just found, but at the end of the conversation I asked them to let \"Dave\" (obviously not the offending users name) know that he doesn't need to turn his underwear with his uniforms. I'm just fine if he keeps them at home. \n\nExpecting a laugh, I smiled as I said it. All I got back were blank stares. They then tell me a story about \"Dave\" getting in a wreck on his motorcycle and going into a coma. Apparently his girlfriend had brought his uniforms in to get cleaned and those were the underwear he was wearing when the accident happened. All I could do was apologize and try not to run from the awkward embarrassment I just inflicted on myself. To top it off I never really had a good relationship with them after that.\nTL;DR:"}

I know we're both young and I know some people cringe at the use of the word \"love\" in such a seemingly insignificant context, but I really do love him. We never really developed a full relationship, and I think it's mostly because he's too afraid. I know that he has not fully accepted that he's gay yet, even though with me he has no reservations when it comes to talking about it. \n\nOne thing I should mention is that I have had crippling, life-interfering anxiety because of him for the past few months, and in an attempt to make him happy I switched to an extremely restrictive vegan diet and have lost 30lbs so far. For context on that, I am 5' 11'' and went from being 180 to 150 over the course of about three months. Whenever I think about him moving away and going off to college I am paralyzed with the fear that we won't ever talk again. We always tell each other that we're going to spend our lives together regardless of whether it means something as serious as marriage or just a close friendship.\n\nHe's moving away in three days, and although it may sound like our relationship is very unhealthy for me, I am completely devastated. I don't know what to do with myself. Last night I had my final time alone with him before he leaves and it was amazing. We played video games and talked and just had an amazing time together. Then I told him I loved him, and he said he loved me back. I don't think he meant it like I meant it, but that was the first time he's ever said that to me.\n\nIf you have any advice or questions please send me what you can.\nTL;DR:"}

That ex has always been around, I've become friends with him and we've always been close. Coming up to our first year anniversary together, we've had our ups and downs but damn do I love him. 28/m wanted an open relationship, I was unsure but was eventually persuaded to at least try it. It's not been so bad, not as bad as I thought. I have always felt like the Ex hasn't really got over him, and 28/m agreed that despite the open relationship he'd hold off doing anything with Ex because it would open old wounds. 28/m is moving away in two weeks to go to university, only about 1h drive so we're going to try and make things work.\n\nSo. Here's the problem. Open 28/m's laptop while watching netflix, left a conversation open with his Ex. I shouldn't have looked through, it was nosey and wrong of me but what I saw incited enough concern that I felt it necessary. He mentions to his Ex how he is thinking they might get back together. He also asks Ex to come and visit him alone when he moves away. \n\nI was concerned, naturally and have confronted 28/m about it. He has assured me he had no intention of breaking up with me and that he loved me, but when questioned about anything else he would not answer. He was still in bed at the time, so I figured I would give him a couple of hours to wake up first and we'd talk things through.\n\nI can only come to one of two conclusions though. He is lying to me, and sneaking behind my back, or he is lying to his Ex and leading him on. I trust(ed) him, and I love him. But I don't know what to do now...\n\nHalp!\nTL;DR:"}

I respond by saying \"That's really rude\".\n\nShe says \"I don't think that was rude\" and tries to retract what she said \"Oh...Oh.. That's not I meant, I meant you are still handsome but you were more handsome in this picture you really were I can't believe it!\".\n\nI'm not one to get feelings hurt, but at moment she made me feel so small.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [19M] with my bf [18M] of a year, should I be an asshole?\nPOST: Me and my bf have been together for a year and friends for a long while before then. We've had our ups and downs, but all in all our relationship is great and we're really happy with each other. We live together too which is great. \n\nThere's only one thing that bothers me.\n\nMainly it's that my boyfriend is super into 'assholes'. I'll admit I can be a dick at times and that's one of the main things that drew him to me (his words, not mine). \n\nI don't mind acting like that. It turns him on and is what I'm used to doing anyway. The issue is, he's pretty insecure, with a lot of ghosts in his past, anxiety, depression and other problems. I really love him so I've done my best to work through that stuff with him, and it's really paid off. He's started to come out of his shell and socialize, which he never used to before. Thing is, when I help him with this stuff by necessity I have to be nice and tolerant (for example, not jokey about his quirks like I am usually). And I don't mind doing it. \n\nBut I've noticed he really acts less interested during those times - his libido's lower, he gets annoyed at me more easily, etc. I don't like that. The moment I get back to teasing him and being a dick he goes back to his usual lovey-dovey self.\n\nI guess overall I'm wondering whether I should act nice to help him overcome his issues at the risk of him getting cold with me, or continue acting how I'm used to.\n\nI don't want to be abusive or take advantage of his insecurities but it really seems like it's what he wants sexually/romantically. But at the same time I don't want him to be struggling with his issues forever. It can make him really clingy sometimes. \n\nI'm supporting us until he gets a job, and I'd get him a therapist for that stuff but it's not something I can really afford right now.\nTL;DR:"}

For context- this group of friends have all just met each other 4 months ago.\n\nI find that guys in the group that are already in a relationship are often flirting with her. I know all of these guys and they don't act like this towards other girls at all. It seems to be something they only do towards her. Whats even stranger is that I know some of these guys have serious relationships that they are planning to move forward with (proposing etc).\n\nI've thought that maybe I'm being oversensitive or jealous but I fairly sure I'm right because things like this happen: Touching, leaning on each other, conversations that are pretty much just compliments, attempts to isolate her from the rest of the group. Keep in mind that our group has a lot of single pretty girls yet she is the only one that they behave like this towards. Their behavior towards the other girls is friendly and appropriate considering they are already in relationships.\n\nMaybe I'm dense but I have not noticed her flirting or acting differently with them than she does with anyone else. Maybe I never see it but it seems like she is receiving all this attention from guys that shouldn't be giving it to her.\n\nLogically I know it seems like the guys are at fault and she is innocent but for some reason I smell something fishy going on. These guys are good people that I wouldn't have thought would act like this and their behavior confuses me.\n\nSomeone help me make sense of it all please?\nTL;DR:"}

I love her, we talk about our future together, we both are on the same page about everything. The difficult part is that she can't really handle hanging out with me and her friends at the same time. She says that when I'm there, she can't be present for her friends and that it changes the dynamic.  Which I totally understand.  We usually do one night of the weekend where we are together, one where she's with her friends.  I have no problem with her hanging out around my friends. I generally have a large group of friends, and we can just hang out with whoever is there, and nothing changes that much.  I mean, guy time without her around is different, but I am comfortable asking her if she wants to come out with us, which is fine by all my guy friends and we still have a good time.\n\nShe, however, has a small group of friends. She really never invites me to do things with them.  She hangs out with me most nights, but she'll be like, Friday, me and my friends are gonna go to ____.  The problem is, her friends are in my extended group of friends, and often are going to the same place where my friends are, and it's weird, because I feel like I shouldn't show up because she won't be able to handle it. I don't know, it just makes me feel odd that it's so dividing like this.  I'm friends with all of her friends, and one of them even invited me tonight, assuming that I'd be with my girlfriend, because her and my girlfriend and the rest of their group already had plans to hang it.  It's just weird getting an invite from my girlfriend's friends, but not my girlfriend.  My girlfriend is extremely loyal, which is what I love about her.  But it's just annoying when I feel like I have to avoid places or am missing out on a get-together because my girlfriend and her friends are there.  How can I deal with this?\n\nMy girlfriend is also amazing about giving me time.  I always feel like a priority and I know she loves me.

She's amazing, but I'm really not sure if she has any similar feelings. After spending an increasing amount of time alone together over the past few months, I feel like too much time has passed for me to still be wondering if she has feelings for me. I think we have a lot in common, and I've been told by others who I've sought advice from that she wouldn't be spending so much time with me if she didn't have similar feelings. At this point I've gotten no physical or verbal signals that would normally tip me off to go for it. I don't want to be confused about this any more, and it has come to a point where I'd rather her just know that I care a lot about her and want to be closer to her. \n\nI'm hesitant for a few different reasons. 1. We work together, with her in a position that is higher up than mine, and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable about that. 2. She's told me that she hasn't been in a relationship in a long time, and she feels comfortable being really picky about men at this point in her life because she's alright with being single and doesn't feel the need to seek out a relationship. This just totally messes with my confidence for obvious reasons. \n\nI'm not really sure how strong my feelings are and I don't even know if a relationship between us would work out, but I am just tired of being confused about things. So I'm seeking advice from you all on how to navigate this situation. I can't bring myself to say anything in person because it just never seems right. I've thought about writing her a letter or card and bringing it to her with flowers, but think maybe thats coming on too strong. I'm probably overthinking this, but I'd appreciate some fresh insight and maybe some tips from some women about how they like to be approached about this stuff.\nTL;DR:"}

I broke up with her right at the beginning of the summer.  \n\nWe didn't text or see each other at all during the summer, but immediately after the break up we had made it clear that we wanted to remain friendly and not to hold grudges.  \n\nNow that the school year has started, the closest thing we've had to a conversation was passing each other in the hall once.  I haven't been trying to avoid her and she's never attempted to start a conversation with me.  I have assumed that this only natural as we have no classes or study halls together.  And, if she did approach me to try and talk about anything, I would not be rude or dismissive.\n\nToday when I got home, I found a small envelope with no return address in the mailbox that was addressed to me.  After joking with my parents that it was anthrax, I opened it to find the necklace I gave her last fall.  there was no note or writing anywhere in or on the envelope besides by address and name.\n\nI honestly have no idea what to think of this.  I understand that the necklace probably holds a lot of memories for her, but I'm not sure if this is an attempt to get my attention or a \"fuck you, take back your shitty necklace\".  I've never had an ex before, so I have no idea how to handle it.  I also don't want to talk to my friends about it too much as I see this as something private between me and her.\n\nShould I contact her about this or just pretend it didn't happen?

I had completely forgotten about him until years later i'm starting high school this weedy little guy who was about half the size of every other guy in the year (all boys school) walks into my classroom and i instantly decide that i don't like him (judging by his face i guess??). months pass and i keep feeling like i recognize him from somewhere and the more i get to know him the more i wanted to punch him repeatedly in the face, i got to know him in the sense that he always had something to say no matter what subject or how little he knew about it. but anyway, later that year after our class photo my mum was looking at it and noticed this kid's face/name and told me the story of what happened at the start of my schooling career and how odd she thought it was that we ended up at the same high school just by coincidence. so after that i resolved to hate this person with every atom of my being, i still give him the stink eye if i see him.\nTL;DR:"}

His parents are always getting OUR son for special events and things; their excuse is that I work so much, should I really be monopolizing all my son's time when they(BF's GP) could spend all day with him? For example, thanksgiving, easter, etc. I really don't work all the time, but since I work retail(I'm still going to school, yeah, I took a break and started over, don't judge me), I have to be there for most holidays.\n\nAnyway, my BF says his parents need him to stay over at their house to dog sit for the week or two they're out of town. When I suggest kenneling, he says it's too expensive, despite his parents making plenty enough to afford it(I know his father makes >60k, mother 40k at least).

She then accuses me of holding back, and not trusting her enough to open up to her. The problem is: I just don't have anything to share. She asks what I wanna be or what my ambitions are, and these are questions I don't even know the answer to, so how am I supposed to tell her? She asks about my family (she's black, I'm white, it only matters to assholes like my family) and I don't want to really talk about them because they're a bunch of racist fucks.

She's toxic and both my siblings have distanced the wrong way for the right reasons. My two older siblings are lovable and fun but not caregivers, they are very selfish. So I've been the one calming my mom down and taking care of her my whole life, it's gotten in the way of a lot of opportunities for me. I get the concept of disconnecting with your mother is sad but repairing the relationship is not the answer. We've all cut her out of our lives as soon as we left the place, and I want to do the same without being the bad guy.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by texting my girlfriend she looked good in a photograph\nPOST: This actually happened over a span of two days. \n\nSo the other day, I sent my girlfriend a text message saying she looked good in a blank.jpeg, you know, a blank picture, and normally, her mother doesn't look at her phone, but we don't hide anything from her likewise. \nAnyways, so, with my luck, after having had a talk with her mother the night before about sex and things alike since I am her daughters first boyfriend, her mother sees the text that I sent her daughter. \nAfter that, my girlfriend (let's call her Peaches), doesn't respond, and suddenly all of my iMessages go in as regular text messages. As it turns out, her mother read the messages. But that's not all, she scrolled through our messages on her phone and found that I had talked to her about the day I unzipped her pants in public (no one was around, mind you). \nSo at this point her mother is freaking out, thinking we had sex and didn't tell her. So peaches try's to convince her but to no avail. So right now, the mother of my girlfriend thinks that we aren't honest with her, and that I had sex with her daughter when I did not, and now she's going to tear my head off.\nTL;DR:"}

And when I'm in a public place and hear one of the little satan-spawns screeching it's obnoxious head off over some life-or-death emergency like \"not getting a toy it wants\" or \"wants candy but doesn't have a job so can't buy it for itself\", I have a little thing I do.  I say, loudly enough for its parent(s) to hear me, \"Kill it with fire!\"\n\nOkay, so today I'm at Target looking through some grocery items, when I hear a woman in the next aisle tell her crotch-fruit that it can't have whatever I'll-die-without-it treat it wants.  Predictably, the little brat lets out an ear-piercing, shrill scream that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  It continues its screaming/crying on a decibel level rivaling a shuttle lifting off, so of course, I say, just loud enough to be heard, \"Kill it with fire!\"\n\nThree seconds later, a woman pushing a cart comes around the corner into my aisle, with murder in her eyes.  Sitting in the little kid-seat part of the cart is the screaming child...  and I suddenly notice it is scarred very badly over it's face, head, and exposed arms -- obviously a burn victim.  The woman, red in the face and heading toward me, screams \"EXCUSE ME?  WHAT DID YOU SAY?\"\n\nMy girlfriend and I turned, walked/ran out of the aisle and out of the store without purchasing anything.  Didn't turn and see if she was following us, just walked out, got in the car, and pulled away.  We were still laughing when we got to Office Max ten minutes later.\nTL;DR:"}

The reason being that I don't tend to notice that I like a girl until it's too late to try anything (ie. until I've been friendzoned). So I'm asking for advice on here because I don't want to fuck things up because I'm in a situation now where I know things can go well.\n\nThere's a girl I fancy, and I knew almost immediately that I fancied her (which I don't do often). She's one of my best (female) friend's friends - we were introduced briefly at a pub few weeks ago and we spoke a little and I felt some chemistry, some flirty signals on her end, but I haven't seen her since. I've told my friend that I fancy the girl and she said that she'll try to hook me up.\n\nAnyway in a few days the girl in question is visiting my friend, and we're gonna go out to a few pubs as a small group. I don't really know much about the girl (as I said we only spoke briefly) but I think I'd definitely like to date her. So I guess what I'm really asking is what can I do to get her to notice me, and to notice I'm interested? I'm not terrible socially, I just don't tend to do this sort of thing which is why I'm asking advice.\nTL;DR:"}

We had an LDR for 2.5 years.  \n\nIn September of this year, I moved six hours away from home for the first time and into a small apartment with him. We got a cat. My boyfriend goes to university and I've taken a year off school to get acquainted with being an adult and living in the big city. For some context, I'm used to living in a big house on a farm and now I'm living in a very small apartment in a very big city.

It's Christmas now and I'm home for the holidays and I'm starting to consider that maybe I don't want to go back to the big city. I like living at home and I'm getting kind of tired of working so hard to be with him. I have to be away from pretty much everything that makes me happy and work shitty jobs.

Her eyes are bloodshot, hair is a mess, face is flushed and sweating, and her bf is holding on to her so tightly to keep her upright. She's stumbling towards the train door to exit and bf asks her, \"Babe, you gonna be ok? Can you make it?\" And I'm standing next to the door, hoping that they would just exit as soon as possible bc I can smell the alcohol and throw up on her. Next thing I know, she bends over, throws up next to my rainboot, the vomit splattering my boot, and the couple decides to go back to their seats and sit down instead of exiting. No apology and they avoid eye contact with me. WTF?\n\nSecond one: I was standing next to the railing near the door and this fat girl comes and stands next to me. She bends over to look through her bag and I can see that she has low cut jeans on and is not wearing any underwear, not even a thong. I can say this for sure bc I saw at least 2 inches of butt crack. At this time, the train suddenly jerks and the fat girl, not holding on to anything, falls butt first towards me. Me, trying to not have her fall on me, throw my hands out to stop and made contact with bare butt cheek. Full on cupped butt cheek in my hand. I say sorry but she doesn't even look at me. After a few seconds, she pulls up her jeans and exits at the next T stop. As a girl, I am horrified at her attire and the fact that I accidentally cupped another girl's bare cheek.\nTL;DR:"}

I was driving around looking for her chain smoking with tears pouring out of my eyes like a torrential down pour. Thank the fucking lord after putting posters up and getting her picture shared all over Facebook I got a call from someone a few blocks down who had her cowering on their porch.

The problem has come when I actually invite her to do something that next week.\n\nJust as background, she is very unresponsive to texts or Facebook messages. So unless I am standing in front of her asking her how things are going or if she wants to go out, I usually will hear nothing from her.\n\nAfter 2 weeks of getting the cold shoulder, I'm wondering if I should let it be and wait for her to make a move, or if I should ask her where we stand. I don't want to keep pushing for another date if she's not interested because I feel like it's a waste of both our time. But I like her, and because she can be so non-responsive, doing nothing could mean letting it die when she actually does like me.\n\nI also don't want to scare her away by putting pressure on a \"where do we stand\" conversation.

So here's the scoop:\n\nI am pretty new to running but I started out with a fairly good level of fitness. I am a yogi, a swimmer, I have an active job, etc. My stats are F/5'5\"/129lbs if that helps. At present I can comfortably run a 5k at about 28-30 mins, depending on the route/day. I don't have any race experience but am running my first timed 5k this Saturday. \n\nI'm interested in running a 10k mid October and I'm wondering if that's realistic for me at this point. I have my eye on the <55 minute category because I'd rather be able to take my time and enjoy it. I have time to train/cross-train every day and I have great self discipline when it comes to exercise. Runners of reddit, what are your thoughts? Is this something I can try? How many times a week will I need to run? Any other tips or words of advice? Cautionary tales? I'll take anything.\nTL;DR:"}

We had gone up and spent the night, and returned home the next day around 8 or so (I had driven the entire trip). Knowing I had to go to work the next night, and not wanting to be awake 1000 times, I doped myself up on allergy meds and waited to pass out. Now, I love my dog, and I missed him, he's a spoiled little dude (Boston bulldog, roughly 25ish lbs) and he often sleeps in bed with me, although usually only when I am sleeping during the day. But I missed him on our trip, so I figured I would let him snuggle while I was enjoying my heavily medicated sleep. \n\nDuring the night....? morning.....? not sure exactly when it was, I started having a really odd dream. At some point in the dream, I am being followed down an alley to my apartment door by a super creepy guy. I manage to get in the door and am leaning against it with all my power to keep creepy guy from coming in the apartment but it just isn't working! Hands are coming in my apartment door so I resort to the last option......I lean down and chomp onto creepy dream guy's hand. \n\nAnd I am promptly woken up by a BYORK!!!!! and a smallish dog levitating across the bed to the complete opposite side. Barely awake I realize what I had done.....in my dream I had bitten the hand coming in my door......IRL I had just chomped down on my dogs foot as he slept next to me. So here I am, roughly 3am, trying to calm my dog down and convince him to come lay down again, meanwhile picking dog hair out of my teeth. And somehow, SOMEHOW, my SO slept through the entire thing. Thankfully my dog was ok (besides being a bit wary of me while I sleep now) and besides me feeling like a total asshat, I think me and the dog are still friends.\nTL;DR:"}

I'll start.\nPOST: When I was a little kid, about 10, I went to see an Orioles baseball game at Camden Yards. After the final pitch, the entire stadium began to clear and massive amounts of people were being funneled down these long escalators.\n\nFor some reason I thought that I should try to \"control\" the escalator with my mind (I really have no fucking clue where this thought came from) and as I was riding down it with my family, I suddenly tightened my grip on the escalator railing and commanded it in my head to STOP.\n\nNot only did the escalator immediately stop (a huge one, very steep, with at least 40-50 people on it)...but many people actually fell into the people in front of them. The people near the bottom actually fell down flat and even my family members were jolted like everyone else.\n\nThe only person who was fine was me, as I had death gripped the escalator railing for absolutely no reason seconds before the accident. Not to mention the fact that I had apparently used some kind of mind-control to stop it in the first place. I can't stress enough that I had never tried such a thing before, especially not on an escalator, and it literally happened the second I decided to stop it, the first time, immediately.\n\nFreaked me the fuck out actually. All the other escalators continued to move, just that one malfunctioned. Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.\nTL;DR:"}

It was a retail store in SF and I was just coming back from my lunch break shortly after midnight.  I had a pocket full of change at the time and as I was near the entrance to my place of work, a homeless, very shaggy white haired, full bearded, looking cracked out man asked me for change.  Although I had change in my pocket, I felt he would just use it for booze, so I said no.  He then offered to show me a magic trick and pulls out a deck of cards.  I tell him I am not interested and continue walking towards my destination.  He then said says, \"Just pick a card, any card.  Actually, don't pick out a card, just think of a card in your head and I will tell you what it is.\"  I had the ace of spades in my mind as that was the first thing that popped up.  Then I thought that was too easy so i changed my thoughts to queen of diamonds.  As soon as I change the card in my mind, the man blurts out, \"YOU WERE THINKING OF ACE OF SPADES AND YOU JUST CHANGED IT TO QUEEN OF DIAMONDS!!\".  I stopped dead in my tracks, emptied my pocket full of change to this man's hand and had a total look of shock on my face.  He then proceeds to do something more astonishing, he starts naming random facts about my life, all of which are entirely accurate and specific from the tattoos on my arm (I am wearing a long sleeve shirt and jacket by the way) down to things that have occurred during my childhood.  Keep in mind I have never seen this man before in my life.  I was in such shock that I didn't even think about asking how he was able to do that, I just walked back to work and thought about it the rest of the night about how this was even possible.\nTL;DR:"}

At first, counting calories was torture, but by now I'm used to it and making slow but steady progress. 1.5 pounds a week or around as much. For me, everything clicked when, after the first month, I realized I now had sort of a basis for how hungry I really was. Before I started MFP, I would just eat until I felt full, which lead to me overeating constantly. Now I can think \"Okay, I'm feeling THIS hungry tonight. That means I should eat about THIS much.\" It's a surprisingly pleasant feeling to be able to trust your stomach.\n\nBut I have another trick up my sleeve... on Thursday, I had jaw surgery, and the recovery period involves my jaws being wired shut for at least a week. My surgeon expected me to \"lose 15 pounds, easy.\"[SIC] I thought that he was exaggerating, but I've lost 5 pounds in the last 3 days, giving me a new flair!

We both fell for him pretty hard, but tried to not let it get between us. She and him started dating, I was fine with it and tried to move on.\n\nHe apparently took my attempts to seduce him as invitations to a friendship, because shortly after they started dating (perhaps because they started dating?) me and him became best friends. This would normally have been fine, were it not for the fact that in such proximity to him, with him making out with my best friend, it was very hard to get over him. In fact, I didn't. At all. We just became best friends, cuddling and having inside jokes. \n\nThis circumstance causes quite a few awkward situations and conflicts to which only I am aware namely; they both come to me to talk about their relationship. And the problems with their relationship. And their sex life. And problems with their sex life. The problem being that they don't have one.\n\nAnyways, to catch us up to the present, she has changed. It is so hard to be close with her, because she has become introverted, self-conscious and violently temperamental.  Struggling to make his relationship work, he has turned to me. He tells me everything, including his complaints about her and all of his secrets. He hugs me, says I'm beautiful, says he can't live without me, and tells me he loves me all the time.\n\nHe loves her more than anything. But he does love me. More than as a friend. I know it... He just doesn't.\n\nBut here is the real issue; I am conflicted. When he comes to me for relationship advice, the part of me that is best friends with her says \"He is all she has!

This relationship is killing him!\" and the part of me that is in love with him says \"Break them up! You can make him so much happier!\"\nTL;DR:"}

Recently, she went on birth control that (in my opinion) makes her a raging bitch. We have had several tiffs and one serious fight since she went on the pill. That fight was resolved and I told her that I think her pill is effecting her ability to function. She acknowledged when she was on her sugar pill but is back on the actives now and (again, my opinion) seems to have lost her perspective.\n\nThe meat of the fight: I agreed, under duress, to attend a scholarship dinner with her because she didn't want to go alone. The dinner interfered with my work schedule but I agreed to make it work. Sometime between me agreeing and the actual day, I managed to get the time mixed up and by the time she texted asking if I was still coming, it was too late for me to do so. I apologized, via text, with the explanation that I thought the event was later (I was still at work). She responded that I \"suck at listening\". This may well be true but I have been working long hours and was doing this event as a favor. I fully intended to go, just got the time mixed up. I admit, if it was something I had been excited to do, I probably would have remembered. But in this case, work was a higher priority and it honestly slipped my mind.\n\nNow, I've apologized twice and even admitted (when confronted) that \"if it was something I got something out of, I would have remembered\". I fucked up. She is accusing me of being self involved and is hiding in her room as punishment for missing the event. The only conversation we've had was when I caught her in the kitchen and told her I felt like she was avoiding me. Although the conversation was calm, I am feeling resentful that I have been super understanding as she has gone through heavy load as she applies for grad school and would appreciate a little understanding that I am working 50-60 hours weeks against deadline throughout this month. When you add the fact that she is extra touchy and emotional due to birth control, I feel like I'm a dude with a pregnant girlfriend!\nTL;DR:"}

Immediately after sex, he picks it up before doing anything else. \n When I have confronted him about it (many, many, many, many times), he usually argues that it is harmless and I'm just nagging him. I have left because of it, and when he begs me not to leave or begs me to come back he promises to \"fix it\" which usually lasts a few days then it's right back to it.

We have no outstanding debt aside from a few thousand left on her car. \nRight now we've got $223,500 split between my Roth IRA, my TSP (I am active duty), three USAA mutual funds, my TD Ameritrade account, her old 401k and, worrisome to me, she has about $80k in Microsoft stock.   \nIn addition to that she has two checking accounts, two saving accounts, one joint USAA checking account and I have my checking account and one savings account.  Just about evenly distributed in these accounts is another $33,000 in cash. The other banks, if it helps, are Bank of America and TCF. \n\nIs there any benefit to having so many different accounts?

I went there with a friend (which has his group of friends that I barely know; so I was a little out of place), and I met there two other friends which I hadn't seen in a long time. We spent most of the night together but they were a couple so I was a little out of place there, too, until I met the boy's cousin and two of her friends.\n\nI spent the rest of the night with these three girls, one of which was particularly attractive, and it looked like she was attracted by me, too. One of her friends told me that if I made out with her she wouldn't have any problem with it and probably wouldn't remember (she was a bit drunk). The problem is that if I'm not drunk I can't let myself go, I never kissed a girl before, I have this kind of moral pillar not to make out with a girl randomly without knowing her (this is probably why I never did).\n\nSo we started dancing etc. but never really got to it. I had to go home: we said bye to each other and I kissed her on the cheek, thanked her for the night and left.\n\nFound her on Facebook and started to text her about the party and we agreed to get drunk together eventually. The problem is we don't have any friends in common and I don't have many friends to go out with at all (they all have their group of friends which I don't know), so last night was an exception and much much luck.\n\nWhat do I do? Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

Of course, I don't know the full story, but during their \"rough patches\", she would tell me about all of the awful things he would say to her (I don't really feel comfortable repeating the kind of things he would say. They just aren't okay) and the only reason I know that it's the truth because I went to school with his best friends who would spread the rumours to me.\n\nNow, he's always had a problem with me. He's gone through her phone before and noticed that we're incredibly close. But always strictly as friends. However, he took this as some kind of threat and he's made multiple threats to beat me up. \n\nThey \"broke up\" about 2 months ago and he started showing signs of a stalker. He would call her randomly and tear her down emotionally, threaten me just because she instagrammed a picture of us, things along those lines. The problem is that she was too afraid to file a restraining order. \n\nThings went from bad to worse when her relationship with her parents strained to the point where she had to leave home. Due to a variety of reasons, I couldn't let her stay at my house but I did as much  as I could to help her find a place of her own. But she's been fairly distant from me lately. Last time we actually spoke was about a week ago. \n\nFlash forward to tonight where one of my other good friends ran into the two of them. It turns out she's living at his house now. From what I understand, she's looking terrible (I trust the word of my other friend. She only told me because she knows how much I care). Pale, unwell and unhappy. He's apparently all over her. \n\nOf course, it's her choice who she dates and lives with. But she's not well enough to be able to make these decisions. It's just hard for me because there's absolutely nothing I can do to help her now. I'm afraid if I try to talk to her, this guy will actually make good on his threats, or worse, hit her.\nTL;DR:"}

This is going to be a little bit long but, she is a 7 month old morkie who is fearful around me and my bf. I don't know when it started but thinking back she's always had signs of being fearful. When we first got her as a puppy at 12 weeks old she didn't do anything a normal puppy did. We would take her outside she would just sit on the grass, she didn't sniff around just sit there and she never played. She wouldn't even eat in front of us.  I thought she had to adjust more and that she would do better if she was around our other dog Beckett to kinda teach her. This seemed to work but maybe to much. When she was around Beckett she was normal she would play, sniff around and come to us. When she wasn't around Beckett she would be afraid of us and revert back to just sitting down with her ears back and her tail tucked. So recently I let my aunt keep her for a week since my aunt has 3 small dogs and there are always little kids around and different adults to socialize her a bit more. She did amazing she would play with her dogs, run around with the kids and play. My aunt told me she didn't show any fear, she told me Bailey even barks. Bailey has never barked around us. So I said great we should see a difference. Back with us everything is the same. Her ears are back and she just sits there. I called her over to come to me she hunkered down with her ears back and licked my fingers. I'm just so frustrated I don't know what to do anymore.  She sits in one spot of the house and doesn't move or play but she didn't display any of the problems at my aunts house. I've never had a dog like her before. My bf is already fed up and think we should re-home her since she does better when shes not around us. Any advice or suggestions? Is re-homing her the best thing to do\nTL;DR:"}

I hated reading(I have only read three books through and through), but I usually followed my gut and, for the most part, got through it. History was by far the easiest, I assume because I could just remember the lectures. Math and English were drags but I always placed mid 70's, which was good enough for me at the time. \n\nI never really had an issue until I began working a steady job, which called for me to take the occasional phone number from time to time.

I feel this way because she mistakenly got confused for a prostitute on the street after the club, and was later in the same night offered a job position as a sex worker by a pimp.\n\nNow, I don't want to act like a controlling boyfriend so I don't want to outright tell her that she's dressing too suggestively and she needs to stop. I want to tell her that I don't mind her wearing revealing clothing, but not revealing to the point of getting identified as a sex worker. I tried to bring this up with her nicely, but she became extremely upset and said that she can dress however she wants and I can't tell her what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

We've become close as friends and trust each other. He's trusted me enough to show his face on webcam and while I was chatting to him one day, my dad walked in and saw his face. \n\nHe seemed alarmed by him. Let me mention I own no webcam and am on a monitor, he insists there are possibilities of him seeing me. When I tell him he lives in Venezuela, he tells me that is a communist country and basically tells me he does not like me communicating with a boy that looks Middle Eastern. It is very obvious that this boy is 14, but my dad insists he could be any age. \n\nHe reassures me that he's not trying to be an asshole, just protective, and I can understand that part. Being American in the world we live in today, I can understand his paranoia. He tells me that I am not the one he doesn't trust but the people on the internet. Again, understandable. My problem is, I have proven to him that I can be trusted not to tell anyone any details about where I live, who I am, etc.\n\nI told Jack this in secrecy and we've resorted to using different websites for messaging in order not to have these chats saved in my email. It's tiring doing this. And it is unfair to Jack. My dad saw me video chatting with my friend, who is a white girl, but didn't say anything about that! \n\nAm I wrong to continue talking to Jack?

We've been getting into fights over very stupid things and it's starting to turn into some kind of unhealthy power struggle between us. My boyfriend displays very insecure tendencies. He blames it on the distance and never having a long distance relationship before. He is uncomfortable with me talking to my male friends, even in his presence. I've let him in on group calls on Skype with my friends and he tends to accuse me of flirting or \"trying to sound cute.\" Another issue that has popped up is spending time together like watching a show or a movie. He will suggest doing something, then do something else for a couple hours like playing a video game, before we do said thing. If I don't immediately drop whatever I'm doing though, he gets extremely passive-aggressive. He'll hang up on me, refuse to talk to me, and say that he's \"just watching out for himself.\" I've gotten emails, and the notification sound will make him think I'm getting texts and he'll hang up on me.\n\nI'm really starting to think that we're not compatible. If I try to have a discussion about our relationship, he says that I'm trying to dump him, and takes any criticism extremely personally. Such as, when I said he has jealous tendencies, and gave examples why, he said I was bringing up the past. How is it the past if these things keep happening? \n\nI'm starting to feel kind of trapped. I keep trying to work out our problems, but he doesn't seem to really find what he's doing to be wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

Year after that, I don't like her. We're all 18. They've been dating two and a half years.\n\nHer boyfriend hates me because I liked her and he thinks I still do. So for the last six months he's been harassing me, acting like an asshole, yaddayadda.\n\nThis week I texted my friend and in reply she said to stop talking to her. This was odd, so I texted back and she replied that she didn't like me. Again, odd, but I couldn't call. She sent one more text after that calling me a loser and saying I had no friends and to never text her again.\n\nTurns out it was her boyfriend. He had taken her phone without her knowing and texted me this stuff pretending to be her. She said he didn't mean it and that it was annoying but I did have feelings for her so his behavior isn't that out of line.\n\n...yeah, so, I feel a little creeped out and worried by this. Last month he made a Facebook account just to go through her photos and wall to see what I had commented on, and apparently he has me on his buddy list so he knows when I'm online even though we never talk to each other. And the way my friend is just hand waving this stuff away as no big deal worries me a little more.\n\nWould I be overreacting to expect more respect from the both of them? Or should I just take it because I did, in fact, have feelings for her?\nTL;DR:"}

I (together with ~50000 other people) were at the concert. Everything felt like a normal concert. The audience was not behaving differently from any other typical rock concert. Pearl Jam wasn't even very big at the time (compared to when they played at Roskilde in '92). But then suddenly someone was knocked over. Other people fell over him. And a bunch of people was down on the ground. This happens all the time at big rock concerts. What was different that day is hard to say. But they didn't get up again quickly as they usually do. More people fell on top of them. I have no idea how many was down but it felt like hundreds of people. And it felt like a long time. Eventually, the music stopped. Eddie Vedder was crying on stage. Telling the audience to move back and make space. Lots of people were hurt but everyone around/on top of me stood up. Nine men close by did not. I could have been one of them but I was lucky. The autopsy showed that they were hardly bruised, they simply died suffocating from the sheer pressure from people on top of them.\n\nSo this scared the shit out of me - but even though I still think about it from time to time, I must admit I dont seem to have learned anything from the experience.\nTL;DR:"}

There is a paywall there, and a forum for those behind that paywall. On that site I met a girl. Let's call her Carol. Carol and I have been dating for four months now. We have hung out in person three times. We live about 80 miles apart, but she is always really busy. I understand. She's got an important job at an insurance company or something. She's been a bit vague about that.\n\nI have been away from that website for a while because of some general drama there. I have, however, been lurking. I noticed she was flirting with two other guys on there. It really pissed me off. I even made a thread suggesting that people should be more respectful to members they know are in a relationship, but I didn't post in that thread. She didn't know I posted it, but in the thread she wrote, \"I always tell my husbang (sic) that what I do here isn't flirting.\" \n\nI was livid. That was yesterday. I haven't talked to her. She texted me last night, but I ignored it. I am really concerned about her possible infidelity with me, but I am willing to hear her out. If she is married, I would have to really rethink our relationship. Thing is, it's not unheard of for people to flirt there. I admit that this is my third relationship from the site, but Carol is the first one I truly loved. She knows about my past there, and she knows I don't flirt with the other two anymore. \n\nWhat would you suggest? I guess I'm just really lost right now.\nTL;DR:"}

The kicker here is that my girlfriend already assumed that she was like that but I always told her that she never did anything and that she's an okay person.\n\nUnfortunately this girl and I are coworkers which means that I interact with her at least 3 times a week. Yes she would flirt but I would create distance and awkwardness to show her that I was uncomfortable with it each time she would. There would also be moments where she would mention her and I going out for lunch but she would slide in \"but dont bring your girlfriend\" and I would tell her that I wasn't interested in going out to eat with her. So essentially I would dodge her advances and show her that I wasn't interested.\n\nThe reason I didn't tell my girlfriend any of this is because she would become increasingly uncomfortable with me having this girl as a co worker and she would also have me block her or remove her which would possibly cause issues at work as the girl would notice and quite possibly create awkwardness in my working environment. So I didn't want to tell my girlfriend to allow her to keep her peace of mind and to allow me to avoid dealing with awkwardness at work and to avoid my girlfriend from getting even more upset with me working with this person.\n\nWe have dealt with issues like this before with me not telling her things but I never did these things with bad intentions, I always did this to avoid issues with my girlfriend and to not allow her to get so pissed off over these things that dont matter to me. I'm not sure how to fix this at this point since I know she understands why I did this but she is just very angry with me not telling her this in the first place.\nTL;DR:"}

I love her very much but I am concerned. A guy she hooked up with before we were dating texted her out of the blue a few days ago. This guy was just a brief fling and, from what she's told me, is a giant asshole. I found out she was talking to him when his name came up on her phone and I didn't think much about it. However they continued to text over several days and she was getting more and more secretive about it. Yesterday I snooped on her computer (I know I shouldn't) and read through the entire text log. \n\nSo basically what happened is this guy is still into her. He pressured her to leave me, sent her a bunch of nudes, and requested she do the same. He also asked to \"hangout\" with her.\n\nIll start with the positives. From as much as I can tell she didnt send him nudes. She also never requested he send nudes, he did it out of nowhere (asshole).Whenever he would ask to send him nudes she would say \"I have a boyfriend I cant send you nudes.\" Also she has not gone to hangout with him. If she had done either of these things we'd be done. \n\nHowever, here is where I am concerned. She wasn't assertive with him on anything. He kept sending her nudes but she didn't tell him to stop she just say she cant return them. Also when he'd request they \"hangout\" she wouldn't say \"NO\" she'd just say she was busy and cant right now. She also told him she found him attractive but in a sort of 'matter of fact' kind of way. \n\nI confronted her about this last night. She said she was sorry and it seemed genuine. She explained that she only talked to him cause she didn't want to be rude. I told her that rudeness is acceptable in this situation. I am still concerned. Do you guys think my concern is well founded? Are there any questions I should ask her? Should I confront this douche nozzle (via text)?\nTL;DR:"}

What should I do?\nPOST: I've known my gf since I was like 12 but only started talking to her properly last year and we've been official for 5months.. I've known my best friend since I was 14 when he moved to my secondary school and we been good friends ever since. They Had some issues where he was using her best friend for sex so naturally she took the side of her best friend and confronted him... her best friend then got angry at her for confronting him and took his side  and her and her friend haven't spoken since... so she blames him for that... she's had an issue with him for a while but now it's actually affecting our relationship.\n\nWhat sparked it off was that my girlfriend wanted to go on holiday with her girls... and it just so happened I wanted to go on holiday with my friends (including my best friend)... she said I couldn't go with him... and I'm like why? She said she doesn't trust him and that he'll make me cheat on her... but she doesn't know him like I do and he would even do the opposite and try and stop me even if I wanted to cheat on her... but anyway I said if I can't go on holiday you can't go... then she got mad cos she really wanted to go... she said I can go with my other friends but not with my best friend but that's the bit which annoys me the most... he's my best friend he's like a brother to me And she basically said if I go on holiday with him it's over between me and her. I hate ultimatums but is this down to that she doesn't trust me? Or she hates my friend that much? Any advice guys?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice\nTITLE: According to the Funeral Rule, is it illegal for a cemetery to require consumers to purchase a burial vault for cremated remains? [IL]\nPOST: I've been doing some reading and some of the specifications in the Funeral Rule have confused me. I know that it states a cemetery cannot tell me state law requires an outer burial container, but can they require me to purchase one? \n\nI know where they're coming from regarding preservation of the grounds and urn collapse, but we're not having an urn. Afaik, in Illinois we are allowed to request a green burial to fulfill religious requirements that specify remains must contact earth. Return and renewal and all that. So if the only thing going into the grave is a specified amount of dirt/pulverized bone dust like fragments, there's nothing to collapse. My sisters and I are younger and not very established, so we're pretty poor and could really use they money they want for a cremation vault on other memorial expenses. It doesn't seem fair for them to require this of us when what creates the need and the law  (the existence of a burial urn that will collapse) doesn't exist. We can't go to another cemetery because my mom's  wishes were to be buried in the family plot with her mom. This is a Catholic cemetery and they say it's a requirement of the Archdiocese, but that shouldn't change what is allowed by law, right?\nTL;DR:"}

We're talking marriage and moving in together in the future so the relationship is serious.\n\nI love him and I've never really had a complaint about the sex in our relationship but it's starting to really, really bother me that my boyfriend has never gone down on me.  \n\nI love sex and I love pleasing him and blow him every time we have sex without fail and also sometimes 2-3 times a day during my period when we don't have intercourse.  I love doing it and I'm good at it and I swallow.\n\nIn the grand scale of things maybe I could cope with the fact that he doesn't go down on me but I think it may be a sign of inherent selfishness.  He's never bought me a single gift in the entirety of the relationship or done any romantic gestures.  I've done plenty of things and bought him a lot of heartfelt and expensive things.\n\nI'm not a materialistic person but I'm starting to really consider ending the relationship in the favour of finding someone who is more generous and attentive to my needs.\n\nI am now at odds with myself about how to handle it.  Do I stop giving him head entirely in the bid that he'll realise the imbalance? I'm worried if I bring it up in conversation it will make him feel insecure and victimised as he can be quite immature. \n\nAlso TBH given his reluctance to have done it thus far it kind of feels forced and awkward now the idea of him doing it.  He should just want to do it without me having to ask!\nTL;DR:"}

I went to a boarding school so we stayed at school at the weekends and used to play pranks on each other to pass the time.\n\nOne afternoon my roommate and I thought it would be funny to fill a plastic cup with water, tape it above the door and then tape some string from the bottom of the cup onto the door so that when someone opened the door, the cup of water would fall on their head.\n\nI called one of my friends to come in my room quickly because it was an emergency and he obviously came over straight away and the trap worked but it missed him completely. We made a few modifications but my friend had obviously told everyone not to come in our room so we just left it attached to the door waiting for someone to come in.\n\nOur housemaster (teacher in charge of our boarding house) had a very unique knock so as soon as he started knocking, you knew it was him. A few minutes later we hear his knock on our door and he was coming to tell my roommate that he had a detention. We didn't have time to deactivate the trap on the door though so a few seconds later he opens the door and to our horror, it worked perfectly. Soaked in water, he took 2 steps backwards, wiped off his glasses and I think he was more shocked than angry. I apologised profusely and he just stood in the doorway and delivered the news before hurriedly walking away.\n\nLater in the evening I went to his office to make sure he wasn't angry and he had changed his clothes. I apologised again and he agreed not to punish us as long as we didn't do it again. Decided not to play pranks at school again after that.\nTL;DR:"}

Normally, I would be able to ignore something like this. I have in past dorms, and for the first semester in this particular dorm with these people above me, it wasn't really noticeable. \n\nIt was only a few weeks ago, when my roommate went home over the weekend and I was in the room, quietly catching up on some reading when I finally took notice of the jumping. \n\nAt first, I assumed they were playing DDR or something that would similarly cause them to jump and wrote the noise off. But after five hours, I figured DDR would have gone on long enough, and that Japanese dancing games were no longer viable explanations. \n\nNot the type for confrontation of any kind, I sat in my room for the next six hours or so attempting to figure out what the hell he or they could possibly be doing without actually going upstairs and asking. When I finally decided to go to sleep, they were still jumping, and a little while after I woke up, they started it again. I'm not sure if one guy just has endless stamina that allows him to jump this way for hours on end or if they take their jumping in shifts, but it's never just a few jumps; it always carries on for hours and hours. It's been weeks and I still have no idea what the jumping action could possibly be. \n\nBut here's the weirdest part: they jump in a pattern. It starts off with five ceiling-shaking jumps, evenly spaced, then a pause for about three seconds, then sixteen smaller jumps that sound like they're being carried out in a box-shape on the floor above. \n\nMy roommate hears it too, now that I've pointed it out to her, and neither of us can figure out what is happening. I'm honestly curious and slightly annoyed when they start jumping around at three in the afternoon and don't stop 'til around two in the morning, but neither of us can think of a plausible explanation. \n\nDoes anyone know a reason why someone would jump in a box shape with five big jumps and sixteen little jumps for hours on end?\nTL;DR:"}

We chatted for a minute and then he asked my name.  Later on in the night, as I was actually leaving, he said something to me and referenced me by name.  I told him I'd definitely be back again, and then noticed the cute girl was standing next to him.  She was looking in my direction, so I assume she at least took notice and heard my name.

Its not like i have any other women in my life to cheat with, but if the opportunity spontaneously occurred, it would be extremely hard to decline. I have terrible sex once a, month.\n\nShe has a genetic condition, that while controllable, makes weight gain easier. I recognize and try to help, but neither of us stay on our health routines for more than a week. She knows she's bigger now too. It absolutely affects her confidence and moods. I understand and try to be sensitive to it. My problem is that we're both 22 and 23 respectively, and today while out of town for work in a college town, i was emotionally wrecked with all of the local, erm, real estate. I read back what I'm writing and i feel like Shit, but i really, really miss awesome sex. Pretty shitty reason for a relationship to dissipate. I don't know if im looking for opinions, or to be spit on, or seeking reddits sympathy. What do you think? Apologize for typos, all written on mobile.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) met a bunch of people around the same time last year, hung out with them the same amount, and it's painfully obvious that they only tolerate me for him. How do I deal with this?\nPOST: I don't really know what to tag this, but yeah. Basically we  met a large group of friends (like 15-20 people) at the exact same time last year and very very very rarely would hang out with them without the other. However, it's getting ridiculous and sad for me to be around them, invited by extension, and sitting there quietly for however long while they hang out with my SO. I hate leaving/feel obligated to stay, cause if I leave I know my SO will too, and it sucks and I feel like I'm isolating him from his friends if I do. But it's goddamn heartbreaking how little they care about me and how much they go out of their way to talk to him. One of them legitimately does not know my name and I've known her for a year. How do I deal with this? I just spent three hours with them and got home and cried on my SO's shoulder about it and I hate doing that.\n\nI've tried to make new friends and go out, but none of it sticks or I'll ask someone what's going on, they'll say nothing, and 2 hours later I'll find out that same person is throwing a party. \n\nI like myself. My SO likes me. I think I'm an okay person, if not a bit odd and I make really bad puns. But whenever I'm around my SO and anyone we've both met it just...sucks, man. They don't even try to hide it. Obviously, they're not people I really want to hang out with considering how they treat me, but it still fucking sucks every time it happens.\nTL;DR:"}

I LOVE this girl. Things started off hot and heavy and haven't stopped since. My friends love her. My family loves her. She goes above and beyond at every instance possible. We've talked about moving in together, marriage, future etc. In short, its very serious. \n\nMy girl has some baggage though. In her teens she had an eating disorder, which she is still struggling with. She has anxiety and self esteem issues as well. I've done everything I can to reassure her that she is beautiful the way she is and that I love her no matter what.\n\nRecently she gave me her phone to put in my wifi password at my apartment while she went to the bathroom. After putting in the password, something told me to just take a glance at her messages. Predictably, I was on top, a girl friend was below and then I saw a name I wasn't familiar with. Out of curiosity I decided to check it out. It seemed over a period of months, she sparingly sent naked pictures of herself to this guy. I confronted her after she exited the bathroom and she was in shock. She had no idea what to do. I calmly gathered her things and told her to leave. She explained that she was \"just flirting\" and that she didn't act on those messages etc. At the time we worked different shifts so I didn't see her often during the week but we spend every waking moment together on the weekend. My friends surprisingly advised me to give her another shot if she can prove that she will stop what she is doing and seek out help. My family has advised me to make a clean break and move on. \n\nI know that her mental history probably had something to do with this because I genuinely believe that she cares about me deeply. I honestly don't know how to proceed. I LOVE this girl.\nTL;DR:"}

I went to a party and had my laptop in the car with me. I put it in my shoulder bag and left it behind my drivers seat in my Jeep.  When I got to my friends party, it started to utterly downpour, I ran outside to check my windows, all is good.  Hours later I was getting in my car to leave and I noticed a 1inch puddle water on my drivers floor board, starting to chuckle when I realized I left my sunroof open.  The chuckle turned to horror when I began to notice a second puddle, in my back passenger footwells, where my MacBook was.....shit. \n\nDrove it to the Apple Store for them to tell me it was cooked.  I called my renters insurance to file a claim. Now, being completely new to this and totally panicked because my $2k laptop is destroyed, I FIGURED the only way I could replace my laptop was to lie to the insurance company and tell them I left the laptop in my apartment next to an open window......I thought that renters covered property in my home and my car insurance covers my property in my car....totally. Fucking. Stupid.  \n\nWell turns out that my renters DOESNT cover my laptop, unless! A tree would've fallen through the wall in my house, causing a hole in the wall, and water would come through said hole and drench my laptop...kinda insane right.  \n\nSo if I would've told the truth about where my laptop was damaged, I would've been able to seamlessly file a claim to get a new one.\nTL;DR:"}

She got pregnant.\n\nEarly last summer, Sarah and her fiance got an apartment. Her fiance is a bit of an irresponsible mooch, and they'd been using the money Sarah had been making. They were stretched pretty thin but Sarah was so happy, she was pregnant and planning her wedding. It was her dream come true. Her fiance got a minimum wage job during this time.\n\nThey decided to get married earlier this year, her parents paid. She is 29 weeks along now.

I don't think she understands how much a baby costs, and the fact that her parents can't support her forever. She keeps talking about having five kids. I really don't know how to bring it up... or if I shouldn't. However, I know if I don't, I'll be waiting for the inevitable crash and burn. I really don't want that.

Our roommate has the master while we have two bedrooms on the opposite end of the house. Everything is fine and goes smoothly, our roommate is hardly ever home but he has expressed to us that he will most likely be moving out when our lease is up on the 1st of November to move back to his home state. \n\nNow for our dilemma - my boyfriend starts Fire Academy next month which will take up his weekends and being a bartender this means he will make less money BUT he is a Veteran so he will receive money from the GI Bill while he is attending Fire Academy. Our rent is bit high being as that we have a 2500 sq ft. house in Southern California and it will not be possible to move with him having no days off for the next 9 months and our dog is a rottweiler so almost all places discriminate against her breed. This means we wish to stay. I think that while it will not be the most comfortable thing in the world financially (but totally doable) for the time being that we should live on our own because he's expressed he wants to get engaged within the next year and having a roommate while being an engaged couple seems a bit odd to me. He on the other hand wants to have a roommate and save money so that when we do get married we have more of a financial cushion. I totally understand where he is coming from but I don't know if having a roommate will allow us to enjoy a very exciting time in our lives. \n\nI would appreciate any advice and thoughts you have on this, thank you.\nTL;DR:"}

He had been arrested for drunk driving after leaving my place. Keep in mind- we had 1 glass of red wine each so he must've been drunk before he got here, which somehow I didn't even notice because he wasn't THAT drunk. So I ask the police officer if there is anyone else he can call because it's 1am and I am a grad student with class early in the morning.  The police officer says that I'm his last call and if I don't come, they are going to throw him in jail...\n\nSo I get up, drive to the hospital where he is getting his blood drawn for his BAC test- I have to be interviewed by the police, fill out a ton of random paperwork while they run my license, etc. finally he is released to me and I have to drive him home... seriously the most awkward car ride of my entire life. The entire time he was saying how he screwed up and was praying this wouldn't be the last time he'd be able to see me, saying how I'd never want to go out with him again.. blah blah blah.\n\nHe was getting pretty irritated/agitated in the car and it kind of freaked me out because I was alone with some drunk guy in the car with me at 3 in the morning when I had only been out on a handful of dates with him.\n\nThis morning he won't stop texting me apologizing and asking me what I told the police. I stopped answering his texts and just want to be done with it. It sucks because I actually thought he was a normal and decent guy at first, and I know a DUI isn't the end of the world but it was a lot to handle last night when he forced me into coming.

I know this may not sound like a big thing to others but it was a bit painful to me.\n\nAfter a while of this going on, I told him that the words were important to me and asked why he didn't say them.

Well if you know anything about hens you would know that if they are the right type(broody) they will lay on their fertilized eggs for about 2 weeks until they start hatching. The eggs need this warmth to survive and hatch into babies. Well after about six eggs hatched one hen just said screw it and got off her eggs to care for the chicks from her eggs and the other hen's too. So now there were about six to ton eggs unattended, and, bein the good hen that she is, the other hen started alternating between laying on her eggs and the other six-ten unattended. Which meant that a lot of the eggs were hatching but dying right after that because they were too Cold.\n\nSo after finding like three dead chicks I decide to move all the eggs to one spot so she could stay on them all at once. I put on a glove to avoid being pecked to death and starting moving the eggs. She pecked my hand several times but it didn't hurt because of the glove. But then she pecked a delicate egg really hard and it shattered the exterior, leaving the poor wee black chick that wasnt ready yet to spill all over, which she pecked up and ate. (Gag) .

A month or so after that he told me that it was too hard and that we couldn't be friends anymore. That was two months ago. Up until this week we hadn't talked since.\n\nFor the past couple of weeks I've been feeling like everything's falling apart. I lost my job, fighting with my family - nothing's going my way. I know that it was hard for him but he was my only close friend and it was hard for me to lose that too. Earlier this week I called him because I just needed someone who I could be comfortable with. We went to the movies and got something to eat - it was nice. Yesterday I called him again and we hung out at his apartment. I'm not really sure how it happened but we ended up kissing on the couch. After a little while he carried me to his bedroom and we had sex. It wasn't for very long and it wasn't what I normally liked but it was amazing. It wasn't endless orgasms or anything, it was just a very strong connection - he looked into my eyes the whole time and I've never really felt that way before.\n\nThe main reason that I don't want to date him is because I'm not attracted to him. He's not hideous or anything, he's just not the type of guy that I'm attracted to. I know it sounds superficial but I'm well aware that sexual attraction is important in a relationship - I learned that with my high school boyfriend.

The problem is, how do I make sure she knows it's a date and that I'm romantically interested in her? I don't want to get friend-zoned, and going shopping with a girl seems to be the quickest route there. Thanks for your help.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [19/M] Have no idea what to do...\nPOST: To help you understand a little more I'll go back a little bit... In my first real relationship I was with her for like 8 months...things were great mostly throughout but for some reason the relationship ended up dying and she didn't seem to care about it any-more, so it ended quite badly..After 2 years of emotional repair (I really feel hard for this girl) I'm where I basically am now. A month ago I started dating someone who I met on-line that I got along with massively. We met up a few times and even went to a gig together and I know for a fact at the start I felt very much in love with her. We met up again a few times and in that time I got to know of her past. She went through a lot of traumatic stuff and already being through things already such as helping people with depression/other issues I suddenly felt a dead weight in my chest that this would come and bite me...Other the next few days I started feeling more and more anxious about our relationships and all the things I loved about her I started to not even think of anything I literally just started to worry instead... For some reason the 2 hour distance between us now felt bigger than ever, and all these little problems just started getting to me so badly...enough so that I told her I wouldn't be able to do it any-more and that maybe I wasn't actually fit to be in a relationship. She took it amazingly well and we play to see each-other as friends because we get on really well! But quite honestly I don't even know what to feel any-more cause I 100% still have feelings for this girl...and I also 100% don't want to string her along or anything. Is what I was feeling in the relationship normal? Did I panic and freak out of things way too fast and lose the opportunity to be with a great girl..?\nTL;DR:"}

Due to our age differences and as I got to know her I realized she had a serious drinking problem: two DUI's, court mandated ankle monitor to read her alcohol levels (that was later), and she's psychotic when she's drunk. While I was in the process of breaking up with her she found a lump in her breast and weeks later was diagnosed with breast cancer, shit. I tend to be codependent, I can admit that. there was no way I could leave her when she's going through all of this(son of a cancer survivor). I was honest about how felt about our relationship and we did a off and on relationship that involved tons of heart ache and remorse. She made it through surgery and didn't need chemo. Our back and forth continued throughout her recovery. Until finally two months ago we attended a party where she drank too much and had a psychotic episode and screamed that I was hitting her, if it wasn't for my neighbors who witnessed the whole thing I could have been arrested for domestic abuse. \n\nShe tried to reestablish contact with me numerous times after that night I told her that we were bad together and we both needed help. I then blocked her number,  I filter her emails, and blocked her on Facebook. Since all of this happened I'm starting to notice that my friends are not speaking to me or reaching out. I celebrated my 35th birthday alone. It was depressing and still is. \n\nWhat should I do its a small city, everyone knows each other and she's somewhat of a local sweetheart(when she's sober)\nTL;DR:"}

Now, this is true, he is just naturally shy where I am more outgoing - but it seems like the more I find out about him the less and less we have in common. \n\nIt's getting a bit frustrating because he isn't very talkative, where as I'm the exact opposite and I find myself seeking out other people to fill the void in our relationship due to this. It's making me feel quite shit because he's a lovely person and I know he loves me to bits but I don't know what to do! \n\nObviously everyone needs friends etc and to not be completely dependant on their significant other for all their entertainment and socialization but I find myself enjoying other people's (male ones) company more than my boyfriends.  It's almost to the point that I'm not sure I should even stay in this relationship any longer but I think ending it might be a little premature.\n\n \nThe main problem I'm having is a conflicting feeling for a male friend of mine. I know he would be with me if I was available, and I might be with him but it's a gamble and would mean possibly losing him as a friend. We have EVERYTHING in common from music taste to TV shows and are total nerds. In theory he's the ideal guy for me but that's never worked in the past, hence me going out of my comfort zone with my current boyfriend. \n\nSo here's the question I guess. Do I stick it out with my current (whom I do love) and see if it works itself out or should I break up with him because it's a dead end road?

The day he chose was about a month away. Now, I've dealt with severe depression and anxiety nearly my whole life. I've even attempted before. So I responded by letting him know I love him and I can understand and respect his decision. I knew I had enough time to be able to rationalize with him to seek help instead (because I know that just telling someone not to do it wouldn't work). \n\nBut then on Friday he messaged me saying he didn't want to wait and he was going to kill himself that night and tell his parents first. Fuck. I panicked for about an hour trying to decide what to do or what I even could do. He recently moved so I wasn't sure where he lived so I couldn't just call 911. I finally decided that telling his parents wouldn't break his trust since he was planning on telling them anyways. I asked my roommate if she remembered his parents name and sent them both a Facebook message. I checked constantly to see if they'd read it realizing that some people don't check Facebook very often. \n\nI finally saw that his dad read it. The dad found him at work and took him to the ER for a mental evaluation. I was so relieved. I knew that my friend probably would be mad at me after all of this.

He trusted me and knew I would understand how he was feeling, but because of me he has to keep living his shitty life. \n\nI know I did the right thing, but I just feel like I've broken a code of ethics amongst depressed people. I know if someone had done what I did when I attempted I would be pissed as fucking hell. I don't know what I expect from posting this, but I can't talk to anyone else about it because that would definitely be breaking the depressive code of ethics (my group of friends where I live all knew him before he moved recently).\nTL;DR:"}

He squeezed once.\n\nHowever, the part of his brain that affects judgement was affected in the stroke.

She claims it works better for her than prescription meds, but she's now displaying a plethora of new and more concerning symptoms. Insomnia/visible exhaustion, loss of appetite/weight loss, delusional thoughts/hallucinations, poor hygiene, excessively late for work, and various other causes for concern since she's began smoking regularly. She's in the middle of grad school right now and has an internship working as a counselor herself with clients shes solely responsible for.\n\nShe's been incredibly distant of late and has began a variety of risk-taking behaviors. Any time we are together, she's basically a walking zombie. I have no problem with casual and responsible marijuana use, but its all she talks about and seems to be taking over her life. She has been through a phase with heavy marijuana use a few years ago during summer break while not working, but she had very few symptoms at that time(compared to now) besides some risk-taking behavior and mild depression. She came out of that pretty easily once classes started and after we had a few talks.  \n\nI've been struggling to make any progress with her these past few months.

It has proved to overwhelm me and often, I've skipped class simply to get a little bit of sleep. I live about 30 minutes from campus. I live with my parents, so no outstanding bills, I pay for my own gas back and forth, though. I was fired on last Friday, I'm struggling to pick up the pieces from that. Additionally, the college experience isn't something that I'm even remotely enjoying. I'm not a social person, more or less. It takes effort to go out once a month with my friends. Anyway, onto the issue.\n\nI have been considering withdrawing from the university when the semester ends. I am in the psychology program currently, but after much research, I don't see myself as being very employable in anything after I get my Bachelor's. I don't have any plans on getting my Master's or Doctorate. Its a money issue and preferring not to get swamped in debt.\n\nCloser to where I live, there is a community college that has a few interesting programs, Computer Specialist (Applications), being one. It would be a year or two of schooling, but much quicker than going through 4 years of a Bachelor's degree. I consider this to be a better choice for me personally, my parents disagree and urge me to continue in college, despite my insistence that I'm simply too overwhelmed to go to class and work. While others may be well up to the task, I am not.\n\nTherein lies the problem, which path I choose, I may be stuck with massive debt or a slightly smaller debt. Working poses a problem with going to college(University or Community) full-time. The CC is in a town that has very few available jobs, while the Uni is in a college-town used to employing people for a semester or two. But with the job market in the area, finding a job is still unlikely.\nAdditional information, I'm a 20 year old male living in Louisiana.\nTL;DR:"}

It's confusing and upsetting and I don't know what's wrong with me. \n\nIt started when I began a new job this year and was getting to know my coworkers. There was a guy that I was attracted to. I really liked him; our conversations were great and funny, he was respectful, and quite handsome. He made it clear that he was interested in me as more than a friend and asked me for my number. I gave it to him, and it went downhill from there.\n\nWe started texting and the more he talked about hanging out/going on a date, the more I became uncomfortable with the thought of it. I started withdrawing and whatever bit of interest I had in him died. This has happened several times in the past and it's happening at the moment with a different guy.\n\nI don't know what's going on.

We are very much in love and have a very close relationship and he's my best friend.\n\nWhat's bothering me is that there is this ring in his room..or his closet actually. It is a big walk in closet with a big curio cabinet type chest in it. This cabinet has a lock on it and he keeps all of his \"important to him\" type stuff in it, anything from old sentimental things to his favorite cologne (that he where's every day, so he sees what's in this cabinet every day also). There is a Tiffany's box and ring in this chest that I have noticed since we started dating. He doesn't wear rings so I know it isn't his...he's been known to buy his mom jewelry but I know it isn't hers because it wouldn't just be sitting in there.\n\nHe was dating a girl and things ended about 2 years before we started dating. He apparently met her in middle school, they were dating off and on during high school, and he was engaged to her for a while before they broke up. I honestly don't see what the ring could be other than the engagement ring that he got her. I go into the closet to get stuff every day too, pajamas and towels for showering, I pretty much live there as well, so he has to know I see this, right? \n\nI know I need to ask him about this because it is bothering me, but how do I bring it up without making him feel attacked? And, if it is his ex fiance's old engagement ring, why is he still holding on to it? And in the place where he keeps all the things that are sentimental to him? Am I overreacting or is this kind of odd? My last ex (from a few years ago) cheated on me with his ex, whom he was harboring feelings for, so I'm not sure if it's fear of that happening again and I'm reading too much into it or if it really is something he's holding on to.\nTL;DR:"}

I threw a party for Fourth Of July that year and invited a bunch of friends.  The landlord was down for the weekend and he stayed in the upstairs apartment.  When my friend's were finally leaving, my one friend was trashed.  He was a good drunk and usually didn't require babysitting.  He was leaving to stay a friend's house down the street.  When my landlord saw him stumbling down the 6 stairs that lead to the front porch, he totally lost it.  He was so angry and was spouting off about how he could lose his house and be sued into oblivion if anything had happened.  He was especially concerned about my friend falling down the stairs.  He reiterated it numerous times.  I walked my friend to our friend's house, stopping along the way so he could urinate on the front door of some unsuspecting neighbor.  When I arrived back at my place, my landlord was understandably upset.  I assured him that that was the only party and it was for the holiday.  He wanted nothing to do with it.  He kicked me out that night and I had til the next day to move.  I wasn't on the lease so I complied.  When I returned the next morning to retrieve my stuff, I saw the landlord in a wheelchair with a cast on his leg.

While I'm a smart person and the work in classes was not difficult for me, I had a lot of mental health issues (including hospitalizations, etc.) that really screwed things up for me GPA-wise the first time around. I took several semesters off between retroactive medical withdrawals, touring with my band, and eventually I dropped out because I needed major surgery and would have missed a lot of school over it anyway (3 month recovery). I had originally majored in art history, but I'm not sure it was challenging enough to keep me engaged, nor do I think that is a particularly helpful degree job-wise. \n\nIt has been nearly 8 years since I last set foot in a college classroom. I have had a stable career since I was 15 (yes, seriously), but I've come to the realization that I can't do this full-time forever because of the physical nature of the work. I would like to transition to a new career as my primary occupation in the next 5 years. I've had a ton of great life experiences, I'm much more stable now, I've grown up a lot and got married and have run my business...all good things. I take a lot of free online courses in a lot of areas of study, because I do genuinely want to learn. I know I just need to get that little pretty piece of paper saying that someone else has validated that I am capable of knowing things.\n\nI know three things at this point: I don't want to go back to the college I initially attended. It was not a good fit for me and is more expensive than I can afford, I am terrified nowhere will accept me because of my bad academic track record from before, and I want to major in something completely different (probably something involving math, computers, etc.). \n\nHow do I proceed? How do I address the questions about my academic past in applications? How can I show that I'm actually ready to do this now?\nTL;DR:"}

I of course replied with \"Absolutely!\" but now looking back at it, I wish I had said \"FUCK NO.\"\n\nBasically after my nephew left to go home with his mother, I hung up the bird feeder and went to get some bird food from the local Lowes. After my short trip, I filled it up with my newly purchased bird chow and went inside to go about my day.\n\nThe very next fucking day, I see a whole army of these sons of bitches in the front of my yard swarming at the big ass bag of bird food that I left outside in front of my garage door. How long have they been there I do not fucking know but when I actually got outside to confront this battalion of foul as a one man army, nearly the bag was toppled over and a mountain of bird seed was piled in front of my garage with every bird in the fucking neighborhood probably piled around it. \n\nTo them it looked like a buffet, but to me it looked like a nuclear bomb amount of bird turd that was going to fly onto my car. So I as fast as I could threw both my slippers at the group and proceeded to BONZAI rush at the flock.

We saw a few ants, but assumed they would go away with regular treatment and moved in. Long story short - we spent 2 1/2 years fighting a never ending infestation of these insects that are impossible to get rid of. We would spray and the dead ants would pile up so high over a couple of nights that we would have to vacuum them up because the live ants were crawling over them to get into the house avoiding the poison.\n\nFast forward to this past April: My wife and I put money down on new construction and signed a no refund contract. We checked the property and other older houses in the neighborhood and saw no sign of these ants. We visit our lot everyday because we are excited to buy our first house. In June we start seeing SOME ants when they bring in sand to level the foundation, but don't want to believe they are what we think they are. They start getting worse, we take a sample in to a local exterminator confirming they are [Rasberry Crazy Ants] and eventually let the builder know that we are backing out. \n\nThey are willing to give our earnest money back, but refuse to refund our upgrade deposit stating that it's a local problem and they have no control. We know that once they invade, they are impossible to get rid of, cost thousands in monthly treatments to try to control, and don't want to deal with this in a brand new house.\nDo I have any options?\nTL;DR:"}

Her position being removed from the company combined with her boss disliking her, she got a demotion at her workplace, therefore her income was significantly decreased. On the outside, she seems to be dealing with it just fine, but I fear it has made a deeper impact on her. On top of that, her husband (my dad) [48M] has always been slightly impulsive and inconsiderate, today even yelling at her for something minuscule and sometimes putting her down her in front of friends/relatives.  \n  \nAs a son, I've always been aloof from her, spending most of my time in my room and never spending much time with her. We've had a couple of issues in our relationship, not to mention that I'm a bit of an introvert, therefore I've kind of distanced myself from her. I love her, but I am not comfortable showing it. This is relevant now, because I think she's always wanted a happy and loving family and I don't want her to think that she failed raising her children and that they hate her.  \n  \nSo, what can I do to brighten her life up a little? I don't want to do anything too big or emotional (besides, I might have a bit over-dramatised the story above and she could be totally cool with everything) and I don't want to do anything that would look weird if I didn't include my dad aswell.

So I am a straight male and being attracted to woman, like most guys enjoy all aspects of a woman. Although like guys there are some things more appealing to certain people. E.g. ass guys, boobs guys, etc. So obviously as a straight guy it's hard not to enjoy the a nice set of breast on a beautiful woman or a nice buttock, but one thing that just really turns me on is the stomach of the woman. I have no idea what it is about the stomach that is so attractive to me. I don't particularly like woman with abs just a flat stomach is attractive beyond belief to me and amongst the group I hang around it's always about breasts or asses, whatever.

I'd argue that once it's cooked and incorporated into a recipe, it no longer qualifies as \"strong drink.\" It's a widely interpreted revelation among Mormons anyway, so among Mormons you know IRL, YMMV).\n\nI want to venture into more French recipes like Coq a Vin or Beef Burgundy.

Since those were my coping methods for my depression over the last five years she has now started seeing what my depression really looks like and I believe that's what's causing these feelings.

During the previews a woman who appeared to be in her mid-30s approached a man who had cerbral palsy in the handicapped seat and sort of demanded (not asked) that he give up his seat to her. He kindly asked why, she took an awkward pause and said that she had later stage Muscular Dystrophy and she wanted his seat since it was difficult for her to walk all the way to front. \n\nMy bullshit alarm went off immediatley since she had none of the symptoms of MD. Her muscles looked perfectly normal, she had no trouble walking when she was outside of the theater. This woman obviously did not have any kind of MD. The poor guy with cerebral palsy gave up his handicapped seat to allow her to sit there. I went and got a theater employee to get his seat back, the employee asked the woman to provide some proof that she had a disability and she could produce none.

Today the smell became unbearable, so I decided to change the water in all the containers regardless of the schedule. When I took the containers out, I found my grand fuck up staring at me. It was a large tub that had a breeding pair of Three Spot Gouramis[wiki link] both of these fishes were in pristine condition when they had entered the breeding tank, but when I checked the schedule on the tank, i had somehow managed to push it back behind the [Zebra Danios] and [Pearl Gouramis] and completely forgot about the water change schedules :(\n\nThe result, I had to clear out about 14 gallons of fish stew, cooked at about 27C for maybe two weeks. And this wasn't even the worst part of my fuck up. When I was somehow trying to throw the water away, the smell became just too much, and I puked onto my [pet bird] and his cage on the way to the bathroom.\nTL;DR:"}

In our almost 5 years he fit really well in my family and established a strong friendship with my uncles and created a 4WD group. He loved me from the start and we were eachothers firsts. In highschool he was quite reliant on me as he didn't have many friends but after school once he stared 4WD he began to put far less effort into the relationship.\n\nQuite often he wouldn't reply to my messages, would come to my house to spend time with me but would end up hanging out with my stepdad or on his phone. He would talk down to me and would rarely invite me to be included in his new friendship groups activities even though his friends would have their GFs there.\n\nI know that I am a very caring person and often care to much but he would often dismiss me when I'd try to talk about these issues, making me feel stupid for worrying even though I felt unhappy.\n\nI broke up with him at the start of the week because everyone I talked to says I shouldn't be with someone who makes me feel like that but now I am devastated. I can't eat, I take sleeping tablets but still wake up in a panic. I love him so much and I miss him like crazy but I think I feel this is the right choice. I just don't see how I'll ever be happy again or will ever be able to move on.\n\nI don't know if I've made a massive mistake although he hasn't fought for me I reached out to him the other day and he just told me to leave him alone although he did say that he's heartbroken and can't deal with anything atm.\nTL;DR:"}

Instead of talking to her about it first, I played detective and saw them coming back from the store together, even though she had told me she went by herself. \n\nI confronted her about all this and we agreed to take a break because I felt I could not trust her and could not know for sure if they did anything intimate.

About last Sunday, a horrible smell came over one of the bathrooms, and it was only in there. I tried to sniff out the source of the smell to no avail. My first assumption was that it was coming from the toilet, where some poop might have gotten stuck in the pipes and is decomposing to create a horrible stench. We poured draino and tried to unclog it, and it did help a little bit. \n\nHoping the smell would go away, we waited a few more days, but it got worse. Our landlords came over with a very stereotypical plumber. He smelt it coming from the sink, so he took it apart. Inside the overflow pipes, he found some large mass. It was completely unrecognizable except for its shape. It was round and had a pointy end, kind of like a carrot, or a mouse. Naturally, we assumed it was a mouse, and disposed of it. How it got there is completely a mystery, but I'm assuming something like Ratatouille. We all hoped that was the end of it. So we kept waiting, periodically pouring some draino down to get rid of the smell. \n\nSunday came around again, and one of my roommates noticed something. There was something moving in the light fixture above the mirror. A bunch of little maggots crawling around, spinning webs for their cocoons. Upon removing the cover for the light bulb, where all the maggots were falling into, I got a huge whiff of death. It only lasted for a second, but it was suspicious enough to warrant investigation. I noticed a tuft of fur coming out of a hole in the panel. We took it apart, and found a very stiff mouse on top, accompanied by very fat maggots. There was a pool of blood next to it as well. It might have electrocuted itself in our attic. Two dead mice in one week. Overall, it was quite an adventure, and my first time disposing of corpses.\nTL;DR:"}

Sometimes it was me, sometimes girls in his grade, but most of the time it was my close friends.\n\nNowadays he is still friends with all the girls he used to like. I trust he wouldn't cheat on me, but I'm scared that he will leave me for one of these girls. He has a lot more chick friends than male friends and this wouldn't be a problem if he don't used to have feelings for all these girls! He's also mentioned to me that guys can't be friends with girls without being attracted to them. It makes me sick to my stomachs hearing  that he's with a group of friends and a girl that he used to have feelings for is there. \n\nI know lots of you will say \"out of all those girls he chose you!\" But the fact of the matter is that he barely chose me!

When we plan to hang out together, he often wears sweatpants (he used to be very fashionable) while I'm wearing a dress or something nice at least. It isn't affecting our sex life TOO much,  but it definitely used to be better. \n\nI love him so much and I plan to spend the rest of my life with him, I just want to find a way to coax him back into his old habits. Is it my fault for telling him its not that bad? Does he feel like he doesn't need to try to look good? Thanks for reading.\n\nAlso thought I should add, a diet won't work. He pretty much hates every food under the sun. Only veggies he likes are corn and broccoli, only fruits he likes are apples, and proteins are steak, nuts, pork and chicken. Doesn't like his food touching either, pasta made with cheese and noodles is his favorite dish... Or BK chicken fries.\nTL;DR:"}

I love my boyfriend [23/m] of 6 years, but I'm starting to really wish there was a bigger age gap between us and I need some outside input.\nPOST: I have a thing for wanting to feel extremely girly in a relationship. I always go for guys who are much taller than me so I feel especially short, I purposely don't gain muscle so that I can be dainty compared to them, and... ideally, I would have a boyfriend who is at least 5 years older than me.\n\nHowever, I met my current boyfriend when I was still quite young and not as mindful about age, since I felt young (and *was* very young!) regardless. Nowadays, however, I feel like my youth is slipping and I feel like dating someone older than me would make me stop feeling so old. I also keep thinking about how often cheating happens, and how if he were to cheat on someone even 2 years younger than me, I'd be devastated with age-jealousy.\n\nMy boyfriend is absolutely wonderful to me and has never once suggested I'm old or anything -- this is all internal. But I'm seriously considering breaking up with him just to be with someone older, just so that I *feel* younger and more content. It's worth nothing that I never really had a childhood because I was so introverted, so maybe that's part of why I'm so desperately trying to cling on to feeling youthful. Is it worth it to explore relationships with older people to get this feeling I desire? Or is it just insane? Help!\nTL;DR:"}

We're also in college, so we have a routine where we'll have little (cheap or free) spontaneous dates quite often, but we only have one \"official\" date each month, which we alternate on planning/paying for. This month is my month.\n\nThe problem, which has multiple points: Firstly, he feels like, as the guy, it's his job to plan the Valentine's date. Usually I give him stuff like that; he's a bit traditional in his thinking, and I don't mind that. However, this time, it's different. We've both been under a lot of stress lately, so I thought we needed some time away from everything - so I booked us a room in a quiet little B&B about twenty minutes outside our city for the 17th. It's gorgeous, competitively priced for the area, and everyone I've spoken to who's been there absolutely raves about it and the woman who runs it. I thought it sounded perfect. Secondly, I booked the room as a surprise; he knows I've planned the date, but doesn't know what it is. I'm starting to get really worried that he'll hate it, or think it's too much, or get angry about how much money I spent (less than $170 at a luxury B&B in Atlanta - uh, hello, wonderful deal), or any number of other bad outcomes. Also, when we were talking about it this morning, he mentioned being nervous about it because he doesn't know what it is - I jokingly said if I told him he'd make me cancel, and he replied with, \"Maybe you should go ahead and cancel, then.\"\n\nI really don't know what to do. There's no cancellation fee until the day before, so I have a couple days to figure it out, but I'm really starting to second guess myself. Help?\nTL;DR:"}

Due to this and the most recent event, I want a major change to change this, get into a new environment and work on myself, get a chance to heal and live a better life.\n\nI know I'd have better quality of living, more money after bills have been paid, better benefits and a secure long term job position if I moved to another country, and that is tempting me a lot. Plus I've always wanted to experience living in another country and I'm not getting any younger. I'm single, 27 with no kids, 1 pet.\n\nBut here's my problem. I'm in my dream job. I've been there for just over a year now and can't say anything but good things about my coworkers and the company overall. I've grown to a very important position because of my knowledge and experience, and they base their long term future plans with me in the equation. Replacing me would be extremely difficult for them. \n\nHow do I tell my employer that I have nothing against the company or my job personally, but my overall environment and circumstances make me depressed and I want major change in my life?\n\nThere's a possibility of requesting a transfer within the company to one of their branches in other countries, but I'm afraid I wouldn't be very popular in the current location if I did.\n\nThe plan from the start would be long term, at least a year to begin with and see what I'd do from there.\nTL;DR:"}

(Our landlord wants to sell the house, no explicit problems with residency.)  Despite our previous discussions to all go our separate ways, they have since reneged, and are looking for a residence together, leaving me (24f) out on my own to look for housing. \n\nHe is really good friends with this girl, and has been for quite some time, even offering her this place to stay after she didn't really have any other open prospects.  His interactions with her were very intimate; this led to jealousy on my behalf, and amongst a list of other things, fueled the break-up - as I wasn't confident in \"loving myself enough for him to love me.\" In the meantime, this girl has become one of my closest friends, rivaling that of my own sister. \n\nFast forward three months, and I find that our mutual housing agreements have been aborted, through the too-loud mentioning through a closed door.  They thought I wasn't home, and went on to discuss their plans to move in together with the rest of my roommates present (one is getting married, the other is studying abroad.)  \n\nIt seems that everyone knew except for me, and I've never felt so betrayed by the people that I called my \"family,\" several hundred miles from home.\n\nHow to cope with these feelings of isolation, lack of belonging, and betrayal?\nTL;DR:"}

Is it an appropriate time to do so?

I was out partying by myself one day and came home extremely intoxicated so I passed out and I wake up to a person standing in front of me about 2 hours later and I freak out and it was her apparently she had gotten into a huge argument with her boyfriend. So as usual i comfort her and try to get her to calm down and she climbed in bed with me (first time her doing that I found it odd also I'm still drunk at this time). so we're laying down I try to keep my distance but shes getting closer and she kisses me. Well one thing leads to another and we have sex. I don't think much of it and to be honest if I wasn't so intoxicated I wouldn't have done it. but a few weeks pass and she's avoiding me not responding and then I get a text from her boyfriend that he knows I took advantage of her and much more things. At this point I'm confused and don't know what's going on and I get a text from her apologizing and that what she said to him was wrong but that was the only way for her to have him forgive her. I was just mad that the fact that she basically said I raped her to him. That's the part that hurts more. I was the one who was underage and intoxicated and now I feel more used than anything.

Alternatively, we've been toying with the idea of doing La Paz first and then flying La Paz-BA on Nov. 1st when flights are cheaper (because of All Saints Day?).  We've got a budget of about $3000-$3500 each, not including plane tickets home, which are already covered.  \n\nHere's the problem:\n\nWe're having trouble finding good ways to travel Iguazu-La Paz, Iguazu-Lima, or La Paz-anywhere without breaking the bank.  We're willing to spend a little on plane tickets so we don't have to spend most of our trip sitting on buses, but we're also pretty used to being on buses for long stretches of time if we need to.  The actual logistics of getting from place to place are a little more complicated than we originally anticipated.\n\nThe questions are these:\n1) Is it better to do La Paz first, then BA? Or vice versa?\n2) What is the best way to fit Iguazu in there?\n3) Are we even being realistic about going to all those places in 3 weeks?\n4) Has anyone found some cheaper way to travel between La Paz, BA, Iguazu (or any combination) that doesn't take like 5 days on 8 or 9 buses?\n\nAs an aside, we'd also love some suggestions on what to do in Buenos Aires.\n\nThanks for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

We could afford it financially due to our good jobs, and she knows this, but I believe that just because you can afford something doesn't mean you should spend money on it. \n\n- The most selfish reason: the weddings I have gone to and the destination weddings I have attended are always justified by the married couple with \"It only happens once in our lives!\" This is seriously diluted when you have eight weddings to attend in one summer.  FFS my SO and I spent $15,000 on attending weddings and their associated events last summer, not including gifts.\n\nMy friend does not have many close girlfriends in our city and has expressed her desire for us to start planning, crafting, and wedding dress shopping - all of which I would love to do with her.

I don't feel nervous when starting a conversation with a stranger, giving a performance on stage, or voicing an unpopular opinion in a group setting.  Sometimes I find that I am too independent; if I had plans to go to a bar with a friend and they cancel I'll still go alone, or if I'm in the mood to eat at a restaurant I'll go by myself.  I'm happy with who I am and my opinion of me is not altered by what others think.  \n\nAlthough that may seem like a positive attribute, I believe that one reason I am single is because I find it scary to let somebody else decide how much they care about me and define my image.  A coping mechanism I use is that whenever someone develops feeling for me, I don't believe them.  I make up excuses like \"they don't have any other female friends so I'm the only choice,\" \"they are going through a short phase, \"they want to date just to be in a relationship.\"  I'm not in touch with my emotions, so I try to logically understand why someone wants me to be their girlfriend and I have never come to a clear conclusion.  But, even if I don't understand love I shouldn't be so insecure to believe everybody who confesses their feelings for me is a fraud.  Has anybody else gone through this?  How did you get past it?  \n\nMy second question is half out of curiosity because it is something I could see myself thinking and not experienced.  It is important to respect and admire your significant other, but often times I will hear someone say that their partner is out of their league and they were lucky to be with them.

We always loved plants though so we  had these tubs with trees and garden flowers in.

I know the other guy was interested in me in the summer, but I think one reason we haven't talked is because he knew I have a boyfriend.\n\nI'm just so confused. I find myself always wishing I could talk to him even though I wouldn't even know what to say. I just feel horrible because my boyfriend loves me so much. I need some advice on what to do or how to get this other guy out of my head?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by getting the wrong haircut\nPOST: This screw up happened not 10 minutes ago. I was out to get a haircut at my local haircut place. This place has a feature where you can sign in online beforehand so you don't have to wait as long when you get there. So naturally, my Dad signed me in under the name \"David\", which is his name. Usually, he went in with me to make sure that everything went smoothly, but this time, he had to go out to get things from an auto shop, so he left me with my brother. My brother and I get to the haircut place and after a bit of waiting, they say \"David?\" So I stood up and was guided over to my booth to get my haircut. About halfway in, I notice that my hair looks nothing like it does during my usual. I look on the counter in the booth and I see the ticket that tells the stylist what a person usually gets. Turns out, that ticket said \"Haircut for David\", who is my dad. My dad is 53 years old and does not have much hair at all. Apparently, if your parent signs you in, you are supposed to let them know that you are one of the children of said parent. I realized this mistake halfway in, but didn't say anything out of sheer awkwardness. When it was all said and done, my brother paid and we left, not letting them know that I actually wasn't David. For the next few weeks, it's going to be nothing but baseball caps and hair gel.\nTL;DR:"}

We dated long-distance for the first year as he was finishing up community college, was living with his parents at the time. After he graduated he move in immediately as we had both talked about and were very happy.\n\nOver the last year he has mentioned on several occasions that he feels like he never got a chance to prove his self worth and independence by living on his own. A few days ago he asked me if I support his decision on moving out so that he can prove to himself that he can make it in the real world. I have already tried supporting him being more independent in our relationship but he has said its not enough and that he wants to see if he has it to \"sink or swim\" while living on his own\n\nAt the same time he mentioned to me that this decision is causing him great heartache as he doesn't want to lose me. He wants to stay in our committed relationship and definitely would want me to move in with him after a year or so. \n\nI love him, and I want to stay with him, but I feel like moving out after moving in is a step in the wrong direction.\n\nWhat do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

It did not bother me. He worked a minimum wage job to pay back some old debt and got his GED. I was okay with him working toward clearing his debt and me paying the bills, etc, since I was pulling in more than enough. \nI graduated college and we moved 700 miles away from home so I could pursue a career in medicine. I cannot work anymore because school is very overwhelming. My financial aid from school has gotten us by somewhat, but it runs out pretty fast. \nHe went to barber school last semester and is currently working in a shop. It is his passion, and he is amazing at it, but he is sometimes bringing in less than $100/wk, and never more than $300. He also frequently spends money on useless things ($10 six packs multiple times a week) and I recently had to put my pride aside and ask my dad for money so we could pay our bills and buy groceries. I haven't done that EVER, and it was a big blow to my self-assurance and to my confidence in this relationship.\n I have tried to talk to him about getting another job. He refuses to wait tables, because he says his 'attitude is bad' and he wouldn't be able to put up with people. He wont sit at a desk because 'it will drive him crazy'. He has all these rules and limits on what he is willing to do, which in my mind, he shouldn't. I understand he just wants to cut hair but clearly it is NOT WORKING, at least not right now. We are hurting for money and he won't budge. \nHow do I make my man do something he doesn't want to do in order to support us? I worked my ass off for years while getting my bachelors and did everything for him that he wanted, why can't he do the same for me? I'm tired of being broke.\nTL;DR:"}

We both respect each others independence, as well as have full trust and confidence in one another.  \n\nHer parents are rather strict and I respect that fully, they have shown me they like my company and they like that I make their daughter happy and respect her.

For the past 5 months or so we have been doing so around once a week (sometimes less, things come up). This ends up pretty uneventful, us watching TV or netflix and cuddling.

I think she may have some self confidence issues that may affect this, which I know is very common for anyone our age. I try to help her out, complement her and make her feel better about herself. \n\nHowever she still gets nervous, which makes me think I'm doing something wrong in our relationship and this gives me some internal conflict and I end up overthinking things whenever I'm with her. \n\nWe have talked about these things before, although not a whole lot and it didn't seem to make any difference. This leads me to believe that I have to take it upon myself and make a change very soon.\nTL;DR:"}

This meant frequent phone calls.\n\nSo, my grandmother used to work nights at a hospital. She still does, but she used to, too. She needed sleep during odd hours. The frequent calls were keeping her awake, so my grandmother purchased a second phone line just for my mother. She made a fine point to let my father know to call only my mother's line, and that he was to never call on their main number under any circumstances.\n\nWell, naturally, lovers will be lovers. If my mother happened to be asleep or not home and did not pick up, what did my father do? Yup. He called the main line anyway, explaining that he very urgently wished to speak with my mother. My grandmother would be woken up from a dead sleep and chew him out for it every time, but to no avail; it just kept happening.\n\n**The Revenge...**\n\nMy grandmother, on her smoke breaks at the hospital, would call my father's house up repeatedly at 3 AM and say nothing. Like a creeper, she'd call and wait and listen to them ask who it is until they hung up. She did this every time my father called her main line during the day. She says she doesn't think he ever figured out it was her.\nTL;DR:"}

She was passing drug tests weekly, it was a requirement to get custody of me. But once the case closed in October she's been in a downward spiral. \n\nShe had been acting strange a couple days a month, but I foolishly didn't want to believe it was because of drugs, I wanted to believe it was her health, because she does have many health issues, including tyroid cancer and liver problems. \n\nJanuary 4th, 2015 my biological father passed away and it hit my mom hard. And it became more and more evident that she was doing drugs. She's been in the hospital 5 times just since he passed. Last night I finally had to call the cops and an ambulance to come get her. She has shot up, and passed out on the bathroom floor, needle in hand. \n\nShe says she doesn't have a problem, but all of this had put a damper on the extremely close relationship I once had with my mother.

I've only seen bits of conversation between them because he deletes them. Which raises flags. The messages I've seen have been flirty but nothing I'd say was inappropriate, except for one where he asked to see her boobs. He also has been known to message exes to see how they are doing because he was thinking of them and that they should get together because he misses hanging out with them. \n\nI don't feel like he has checked out of our relationship, he genuinely seems happy and we talk about the future often. However, I am not very comfortable with these things going on behind my back. We talked briefly once about what what appropriate when it came to flirting and he said he was fine with anything I did as long as it wasn't physical. He also mentioned that monogamy isn't natural and that he sometimes misses parts of being single... going on to say that being in a relationship outweighs being single though. He also said that it is normal to feel nostalgic about old relationships.  Which leads me to think that maybe this flirting is some sort of ego boost. I am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and say maybe it really is nothing more then some sort of self affirmation and he really doesn't think it is that big of a deal.\n\nI want to talk to him about it, though I can't ask him directly about what is going on. Someone suggested that I ask him about monogamy and see if he is happy about what we have and if there is anything he feels he needs more of, whether it be being free to go and flirt or whatever. \n\nI'd like to try and talk this out first before going to the default of breaking up. It would be great if anyone out there has some knowledge of 'openness\" (?) in their relationship and what my options are.

It was great for a while but then we both went to summer camp. When he went to camp he started ignoring me completely and because of that I started to flirt with other guys.

Being the absolutely wonderful fucker that I am, I told someone in a giddy rush. We ultimately decided to stay together but that was the first time I broke his trust.\n\nFast forward to December:\nHe started getting jealous of my friends (he agrees with this) and somewhat emotionally abusive. He was really bothered by what he thought was flirting and what I considered friendship. I reassured him that it didn't mean anything to me and we were still working through it.\nAs of today, we have been having regular arguments and he talks about his lack of trust in me and my compulsive lying. I have a really terrible habit of lying when I am stressed about something and because of the strain of the relationship he took notice to all the little flaws. It basically came out that I was flirting with someone from camp and just called him a friend. This confirmed all of his insecurities and he said he had to think about it and to talk about it in the morning with an implication that we should break up.\n\nShould I just leave it as is and try to be friends?

All my friends went home from school (we're in college) for the summer.\n\nSo I realized very suddenly that I would be alone for almost 3 months. I suffer from depression and anxiety and this coupled with my boyfriend and I fighting over some things that made me uncomfortable made my self esteem plummet. I was so miserable.\n\nI met a guy at work who was really nice to me and was able to manipulate me into thinking that my relationship wouldn't work out. One thing led to another, and things happened. We didn't have sex thank god, that's the only good thing I've got going for me in this situation.\n\nSo he gets home and finds out and is completely devastated of course. He told his friends and his family about the situation because he was convinced that we could never work out. If we didn't live together, we probably would have broken up. I've never regretted something so much in my life, so we are trying. The ball is I'm my court to show him that he can trust me and for me to make him feel loved, but that's not what I need advice on.\n\nBecause he thought we were done he told his friends and family and now it's really hard for him to reintegrate me into his life. Especially with his friends because of the social stigma of taking back a cheater. I just want to know if it's possible for him to reintegrate me back into his group of friends and eventually get to the point that it felt like it never happened. And if it is possible, how would we go about doing this? We are both really scared and uncomfortable please help!\nTL;DR:"}

We broke up about 10 months ago but we recently got back in touch and now we have a date planned for later this week.  I was trying to see if anyone had advice about getting back together with an ex that you were once in love with.\n\nRelevant Details:\n- I miss her and still have strong feelings for the girl.  She is mostly awesome.\n\n- The reason we broke up is because of a lengthy screaming match of a fight over almost nothing where she called me an \"asshole\" and said I was \"ruining her life\".  These fights happened once every couple months and each time she would apologize in the morning and say she didn't mean these things but they were starting to sting.\n\n- We had dinner the other night where she told me that she still loved me and wanted to repair things.\n\n- My close friends are not thrilled about the possibility of my getting back together with her.\n\n- The worst thing she did while we were together was getting incredibly drunk at a concert we were at.  She sat on my lap and told me she loved me. I went to get drinks.  When I got back she was making out with a guy in our row.  I got upset. She ran away and I found her at the bar trying to come on to another guy.  Again, apologies in the morning.\n\n-All the bad moments in our past relationship correlate to nights of heavy drinking on both sides.  \n\n- She supports me in everything I do. The sex is great. Her family loves me, my family loved her.  She loves cooking for me.  She's terrific when alcohol is not a factor.\n\nI feel like I want this to work but it'd be great if someone had a story about how a similar situation turned out terrific for them.  Of course, other experiences and advice would also be appreciated as I'm just trying to sort things out.\n\nThanks guys.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not talking about looks, i'm talking about personality. She is amazing. I love her more than anything and she also said that she loves me many times. We talk every day, when we can we video chat on skype. She is one of the few things that make me happy recently. She is the only person that I trust to talk about anything, with who I truly open myself. The problem is that she lives in another country. I don't want to say from which countries we are, I don't think it matters. But she really wants to see me and I'm going to visit her in the middle of 2013 and I'm going to spend a lot of money just for that. I know her for 7 months now.\n\nAnyway, yesterday, january 1st, I thought \"Why not begin the year with something good?\" and oficially asked her if she wants to be my girlfriend. Now this is where I got punched in the face: she said that she needs to think because this is too important for her and she lives there, I live here... I got so sad when I read that... after saying that she had to go to sleep. I kept thinking about it the whole night, it was hard to sleep. Today I woke up and kept thinking about it. I went to gym to work out, but was so sad that I only stayed there for about 20 min and left.\n\nI know we are too young and it would be hard, but damn, I know people that made it work. I want to try it because I f*cking love her. Even if it doesn't work, I wanted to try.\n\nSo please help me people. Give me your thoughts about it. Give me your advice. Please.

I'm nearly half-way, when I pass an undercover police SUV driving suspiciously slow in the right lane. Once I pass him he pulls behind me and turns his lights/siren on. I pull over, roll my window down, and the first thing I hear is \"Put your hands outside the window!\" So I comply, then the detective says \"Get out of the car!\" I still have my seatbelt on, but I open the door anyway and turn around and see he has his gun drawn on me. At this moment I started to freak out. \n\nI'm trying to explain to him my seat belt is still buckled and I can't get out of the car with all the highway noise. So, he walks over, unbuckles me, and immediately puts handcuffs on me. He walks me over to his car, and asks me \"Is there anyone in your trunk?\". I was thoroughly confused, said no, and he replied \"We got a call saying someone is trying to escape from your trunk!\" I told him he must have the wrong car. He said he was sure it was mine, they had my license plate number and description. So, I told him to look in there, and he'll see there's nothing in there. By this time, the Sheriff of the entire county showed up, and they both cautiously opened my trunk while I stood by the SUV handcuffed. Of course there wasn't anything in there except some tools and work boots. \n\nThey both immediately apologized, disarmed, and uncuffed me. The detective then told me a lady had been following me for 10 miles and called 911 saying she thought there was someone trying to get out of my trunk because my LED license plate light was flickering. I knew it was loose and would sometimes flicker from when I installed it, but she apparently thought it was someone trying to get out of the trunk. She even told the dispatcher that she thought she saw a hand! Apparently 2 entire county's sheriffs departments were on high alert looking for me. Anyway, the detective followed up with me today and apologized again for the mishap. Man, was that an experience!\nTL;DR:"}

She is a full time bartender at nights and I work typical 9-5 days so our schedules are opposite. She has volleyball leagues twice a week so our time together is very limited. \n\nI could tell she has been depressed and having self esteem issues and I've tried to help her along the way and compliment her as much as I could. I thought we were finally starting to make some headway when Wednesday I came home to her crying and she said it wasn't working. She had gone grocery shopping that day and said she was going to make us a meal. It never happened. The fridge is full.\n\nShe then told me that she's been depressed and suffering some the lowest self esteem she's ever had. She told me that she feels like she is incapable of taking care of herself.\n\nI ask her if there is anything wrong with the relationship and she brings up a few things about not doing things together which I explain is mostly because of the opposite schedules. But other than that she said there is nothing wrong with the relationship that is causing her to feel the way she does. The bottom line is that she needs to be alone because she's completely lost sight of her goals and feels like she can't get control of her life if she is in a relationship. But does think we could end up back together again after she gets things in order. She also said she doesn't want me to be with her if she's going to not treat me well while she is figuring shit out. (Distant, depressed, etc)\n\nIt's been a couple days and I haven't contacted her, I've given her time and space as she left for her mothers after our discussion Wednesday night. She hid her relationship status on facebook but did not end the relationship with me.\n\nWhat should I expect or do if anything? More just getting it out than anything.

She even blurted out randomly that she wants me to like her and flirt with her, which I thought was amazingly cute the way she did it.\n\nAfter a couple of days, I brought up the discussion of when to meet, and she didn't know when. I suggest next weekend (a week from then) and she declines. I don't pressure her, assuming she may need to talk to me for a few more days before she decides. That same day she says we could meet next weekend if she could bring a friend.\n\nI told her I'm uncomfortable with that. Through the resulting conversations, I now have a less than stellar impression of her. While she changed the details of her story several time, the basic story right now is that she wants to bring her friend for safety, although I highly suspect it's mostly for support. I have suggested meeting at day time, in a crowded place, and that she could even drive us or meet me wherever we decide to go. Declined. I suggested doing something on her university's campus. Declined. She has stated that I don't even have to meet her friend, just that her friend be somewhere nearby. The thought of having someone there watching us or whatever is even more disturbing to me.\n\nIt's not just her wanting to bring a friend along, it's the fact that she couldn't tell me straight up the exact reason she wanted to bring someone along (she initially made it sound like her friends/parents were forcing her to bring someone) and that she's apparently cripplingly shy.\n\nI'm generally skeptical of younger girls that have not been in college for very long.

My girlfriend has always had depression, but at the beginning of the relationship I was able to help her a lot more. I convinced her to go onto anti depressants, she began seeing a counselor, we were able to talk about the things that were bothering her, etc. We were fighting the depression together, and it was working. \n\nHowever things began to get worse. She began to get sick of me telling her that everything was okay and that we would fight through it. I think she began to resent me a bit because I always tried to counter her negativity with my positivity. She stopped seeing her counselor because she said it was \"a waste of her time.\" She doesn't think counselors help at all, partially because I think that she doesn't tell the counselors everything that she should. She always says the sessions are awkward and filled with silence but then I ask her if she told the counselor about this or that and she says she didn't. Then after all of this, her dad found out she was taking antidepressants and advised her to stop. This was several months ago and she refuses to even consider them an option at this point. Whenever I bring up counseling or antidepressants, she gets in a really bad mood and refuses to talk about it.\n\nI don't know what to do at this point, because her depression is getting worse and it's taking a massive toll on our relationship. I feel like she's losing her feelings towards me because she thinks that it's me versus her when in reality it's me and her versus her depression. I so badly wish she would try medication and counseling again but she simply refuses, and I feel like there is nothing I can do at this point. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I know that this subreddit will say she can do whatever she wants, since she broke up with me after the first time, but she is clearly taking him out and introducing him to her friends as her boyfriend, only a month after ending things with me (because of what she did with him).

I'm 20 years old, just finished my sophomore year of college and decided to live at home for the summer. Last summer was rough with my parents, the first summer home from college they were both adjusting to giving me more freedom. But, we fixed everything and they both (especially my mom who is the over bearing one) promised they would give me space and treat me like an adult this summer. I know I'm only 20, and that isn't an adult in some people's eyes. However, I go to school on the complete other side of the country, pay rent, feed myself, you know, general things proving I can take care of myself.

Most likely from being home where I don't have much of a life anymore. My mom and I were getting along so well, I was much more open to her and she wasn't judgmental, I was really, really loving how close we were getting. That's why it hurt so bad when I discovered she had severely been snooping into my private life.\n\nWe were all noticing that she was acting kind of depressed. My father even came to me and asked for me to try and figure out what was wrong. Two nights ago my head starting running and I was sure her mood was because of me. The next morning I figured I was probably over thinking things, but I'd bring it up just to relieve me from constantly thinking about it. Turns out she looked through my phone (which I pay for), found somethings out that have nothing to do with her (mostly sexual things, the kind of stuff you don't want to be sharing with your mom), and found out I had a profile on a BDSM website.\n\nI feel so betrayed. So angry. She had no reason to pry on me like that. I don't know what to do. I'm sad because I feel like I lost my best friend and my mother.

Little bit of background, I'm a 20 year old guy, interested in a 20 year old female friend, we are both juniors and both attend the same university.\n\nOkay, so we've been friends since freshman year, and things have always been going pretty smoothly. We both suffer from social anxiety/depression, and have a lot of interests (politics, shows, movies, music, etc.) in common.\n\nOver the years she always joked that we \"were pretty much a chick flick\" and would end up getting together despite anything that came up. Even when we got drunk and made out this semester (3 separate times), I still kinda laughed the 'chick flick' thing off, but somewhere I knew she was right and we were getting a lot closer together. Anyway, she started getting a bit more hormonal, and when I was away for a weekend she slept with a mutual friend of ours. This is where the problem started.\n\nIt became more than a one-time thing, and while they aren't exactly dating, they're at least friends with benefits. She's even said she wasn't really into him at first, but now she likes the FWB. She also said she only got with him to start with because she wanted to lose her virginity, and I didn't put out enough.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I know I'm interested in her, and I'm getting upset seeing her be FWBs with my friend. I want to tell her how I feel because I feel very strongly that we would work well together (not to mention that my friend is very judgmental towards people who drink, people who need anti-depressants, etc., and has made her very upset/cry multiple times with his statements).\n\nCan anyone help me figure out what I should say to her?

I've officially joined the ranks of frustrated Comcast customers today, and I'm looking for a little advice.\nIt all started last Friday, when a Comcast representative called me and told me that, for only $4 extra a month, I could get cable. Naturally, I was pretty excited because I live by myself and haven't been able to afford cable for a few years now. I agreed to the deal, and asked them to ship the cable box to my work address, since I live in an apartment building. Also, I'll be out of town all next week and my work could hold it until I got back.\nToday I got the confirmation with the tracking number, and saw that they had ignored my request and shipped it to my home address. Also, my UPS tracking number isn't working, so I can't even pay to have it re-directed.\nHas anyone else been in this situation? If so, what did you do? I'm pretty frustrated and don't want to get charged if the box can't be delivered. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

We are now 2 years together, and I love her.  We did sex right from the start, and the sex is really great. \n\nBut, since last year she has been less inspired and more evasive to do sex . I didn\u00b4t understand it because she likes to say how sex is amazing for her, but I though it was just the passion dimming.  She went through depression, and during that time she was rarely in the mood for sex, and I respect it. She is getting better just now and went back to church, but as a catholic she can\u00b4t have sex before wedding.\n\nWhen we met, she wasn\u00b4t an active catholic, and appeared to be even less religious than I am. That changed, and I kind of blame on her  sister for it. (Her sister is a very very very religious person). I have no problem with her religion, apart from the sex.\n\nI must say I am pretty angry about this. I really don\u00b4t want to end this relationship, and if I want it we will have sex just because I know to turn her on beyond her defenses. But I don\u00b4t want guilty sex, I want her to ignore this rule like everyone else does. And I don\u00b4t see myself marrying in the next 2 years.\n\nThat said, I think that the period of not having sex so far is making us more horny which is actually good. Maybe I am just finding a way to get a positive aspect on this.\n\nTo me seems like I have no choice, I can give in and agree to not have sex. Or I can finish this relationship.  Do you guys see any way out ?\n\nSorry for any bad English, I'm not a native speaker.\nTL;DR:"}

I moved away for a year to do a course, then moved back during the summer and got a new place. My roommate moved out two months ago and my friend needed somewhere so it seemed perfect for her to move in. \n\nHowever, things have felt weird (for me at least). She's been seeing one of our mutual friends who we met during the summer. At first I was really happy for them both (and still am) but now I also feel left out because they are both constantly in her room and I always feel weird about even just going in to say hello. I like the guy a lot but I always feel like they want to be alone. And he's technically living with his parents which means that he's pretty much staying here the majority of the time, so I basically never hang out with my friend.  \n\nI feel really lonely because our other best friend has gotten a really demanding new job so I don't really see much of her either. I have a boyfriend who I love to death and he's been the one who I've been hanging out with most but I need to hang out with my closest female friends too. \n\nMy grandmother died a few weeks ago, and after I told my friend/ room-mate I was really disappointed in her for not asking me how I was doing over the next few days or calling me to see how the funeral was etc. I told her that along with how I've been feeling distanced from her and she apologised and explained that she just didn't think (which is actually common for her) and we agreed to spend a bit more time together, but it hasn't happened. Whenever her boyfriend is busy doing something she'll make plans with other friends or stay in her room - otherwise they're both in there together. \n\nI'm not sure what else to do at this point, but it's really bringing me down and I've even been thinking that I might need to move out.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How do I [31 M] make close friends as a straight, effeminate dude.\nPOST: I was raised and educated in a somewhat unusual setting, and for various reasons, I was basically exclusively around women and girls growing up (stay at home mother and aunt. My father worked a lot.). I had two sisters around my age (two years older, one year younger) and a bunch of female cousins that i was raised with. None of us were raised in a particularly strongly gendered way, and I certainly wasn't raised as a girl or anything dramatic, but I obviously sort of just went with the flow growing up. I think I first started interacting with other boys my age on a regular basis at like age 16 when a new neighbor started hanging out with us a lot more.\n\nI ended up as a pretty average, hetero dude with some stereotypically female interests that tends to click better with women. This is absolutely nothing against men, I have and have had male friends, but there is still a difference in most men and women interact, interests, etc and I'm just much more comfortable with women. \n\nI'm pretty happy with who I am, and I have and have had both men and women as friends, but always feel a little bit like an outsider and it feels like it has kept me from finding really close friends. My best friends have always been women, but there is always a little bit of a barrier, because at the end of the day, I am obviously not 'one of the girls' and the possibility of sexual attraction tends to mess things up (your boyfriend perceived me helping you do your nails as hitting on you, when we actually just share an interest in nail art, etc). On the other hand with most men, we can be good buds, but at the end of the day I don't really feel like I'm being myself.\nTL;DR:"}

I love my parents, they're good people but they won't tolerate me or my sisters dating anyone who isn't the same skin color/religion/race as us. Me and my older sisters (19,21) have expressed their disdain towards this rule to my parents but they won't budge.its so strange, my parents don't hate or even dislike people of dif. ethnicity, they just don't want us dating them. Anyways, I was never into dating so this rule never really effected me too much it just annoyed me for it to exist.\n\nUntil this year. I was put in a class with Eric. Me and Eric became fast friends. After lots of flirting we eventually fell for each other. He  is one of the sweetest, smartest, funniest guys i know. There's only one problem. He's not the same ethnicity as me. when he asked me out i was so overcome with happiness i said yes right on the spot. We laughed awkwardly, said we had to go to our separate classes and that was that. It was only until later that day when I realized that if I was going out on a date, and if Eric and I ever became a couple, my parents would want to meet him. And they would not be happy.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do. I really like Eric but my parents would be livid if they knew i agreed to a date with him. The date hasn't been planned yet so I still have time to approach them, but I don't have forever. I feel so sad and trapped and jealous of those who can date who ever they want without race being an issue. I cant move out of my home because i only work a part time job and thats not enough to pay rent, and i don't want to estrange myself from my parents, but i still would like to pursue a relationship with Eric. So reddit tell me, what should I do? Is there anything I can offer/say to change their mind? Should I break it off with Eric? Should I fight my parents? I don't know.\nTL;DR:"}

No one in my family likes this man, except her, and she seems to like him more than enough for all of us. He is arrogant and probably more than a little bit sexist.

She is madly in love with this prick. He buys her off. When she isn't the little kitty at his feet lapping up her milk she is off spending his money. Spa treatments, peticures, etc. She drives a mercedes for Christ's sake.

She has become more than a little arrogant herself\n\nOk sorry, back on topic: They invited the whole family over for a party last past weekend and announced she was pregnant. I almost blurted 'when is the abortion' but they BOTH want to keep it. They were both glowing. The only reason I could see for this man to want to keep a baby is to tie my sister up with him without marriage. It certainly puts an end to everyone's hopes that she would snap out of it.\n\nI just wish there some way to explain to her and get it through her empty mind that this relationship is fucked up. She is living in fairy tale land in a life that she didn't earn and isn't hers to have.\nTL;DR:"}

Is a mutually dysfunctional relationship even feasible?\nPOST: I am 21, he is 22. We have been together off and on for four years now. Every time we broke it off it was because one or the other of us went into a 'rut': no interest in normal activities, no socialization, a static apathy. We got back together eight months ago and it has once again reached the point where we cannot be around one another because we make each other even more depressed/irritable/angry/sad. \n\nI feel like shit and know he does too, yet I can't summon a scrap of compassion toward him when I see him -- only irritation and resentment. The last time I saw him was a couple of days ago. I tried to shut down that negativity and say nothing, just listen even though he wasn't saying anything. It almost felt real -- then I said he was playing too many videogames. When I do the same thing. What small relief there was vanished and he ignored me until I left.\n\nI sent him an apology. We haven't talked since then though. It's not entirely unusual -- we fight 'silence wars' all the time. This is the first time, though, that we've been so mutually enthusiastic about it. This is the first time I haven't been able to feel a shred of affection for him in that absence. I've largely withdrawn and when I think about us/him it's with a grim disgust. I know I'm being cruel and toxic but it feels like if I let down this barrier that I'll disintegrate and become totally functionless.\n\nPlease -- if anyone has a close relationship with a depressed person, or is depressed themself -- I need your advice. As far as I've experienced, depressed + depressed = very fucking depressed. Is there any way in hell for two depressed people to have a healthy relationship/not destroy each other?\nTL;DR:"}

My neighbor, who is on parole, is now dealing meth. I know this for a direct fact, as I used to be friendly with him and have personally witnessed such sales (leading to the end of my friendliness). It has now been several months, another neighbor became a customer and over a period of about a week nearly burned down his property and then literally smashed it up with a 2x4. Luckily that guy is now gone. But the dealer now has some jerk coming over at all hours (afternoon, evening, 3am, 6am, etc) blaring bass that shakes my house. Dangerous people are passing through, and I hear strange noises outside in my yard, often. Now to top it all, he has at least one person living in a tent/compound they have erected in his yard, complete with shanty-town styled fencing around it and tarps and blankets to create privacy. All of these people who squat or pass through are clearly, ahem, customers of his. I believe one to be a prostitute, after she begged me to be some other girl on the phone to a man I now believe is her pimp. I have to do something about this situation, I have children, and I work and can't get any sleep with this ridiculous bass. However, I have called the cops in this neighborhood (pretty ghetto) before, and pretty much unless you shoot up or stab someone directly in front of them, they aren't inclined to do anything. They flat out refused to help me before. I'm considering calling the OSBI Narcotics task force instead. What level of evidence will they require? Will they be more likely to be of help, or should I try the regular cops again? Should I just call in noise complaints whenever they break the noise ordinance in the hopes that they will show up at the right time and catch someone holding?\nTL;DR:"}

I'm a huge basketball fan and this is huge for them. Since he is now in this new section of the company he got offered by the CEO a ticket to the game. Now obviously I am outrageously jealous and pissed off about the unfairness of the situation. My boyfriend didn't even go to the university. We were originally planning on trying to go with each other but he didn't want to spend the money. Now that he is getting to go for free he wants to go and doesn't get why I'm upset. \n\nSo really I'm just looking for some advice on how to overcome this jealousy I'm feeling and not resent him for these extra bonuses he is getting from our company. As much as I want to be happy for him it is incredibly difficult when the situation is so unfair.\n\nI love him so so so so so much. More than anyone I've ever dated.

This means that I sit at a table with her every day, we make all our group work together and help each other with homework.\n\nThroughout the last couple of months, my crush started developing.

She did not respond until the morning after and my nerves were absolutely destroyed.\n\nThe response though, would not help. She was flattered, but already had a guy. Cue the heartbreak, the sad music and all. Now, I thought this would at least give me closure, that I would be able to finish it there.

Now we hardly talk anymore (whereas before we used to talk almost everyday), and things just feel awkward and weird now with her. \n\nSo now I don't know what to do, the company is fairly small so I'd probably see her everyday. I don't know if I should tell her that I'm applying there, or if I should just apply and show up out of the blue.

Additionally, we are both trust each other and are secure (going out for girls/guys nights alone with friends), and there has never been any drama or fighting between us. \n\nWhat flaws I have found in the relationship is a combination of both myself and her. Perhaps I'm afraid of commitments, but I always think about the big picture when I come to major decisions. I'm in the process of looking for another job and don't want to limit myself to my current city. My gf would not dare to move away from her friends and family. Also, I'd like to think I take good care of myself; what I eat and exercising often are very important to me. In contrast, my gf is the opposite, which I find irksome. She is complacent at her sub-par job, with very little initiative to improve her current situation, whether it be improving her job skills or physical health.

When I say trampy, I mean *trampy*. This girl, who I've known for over a decade, is the biggest prude I've ever known and she starts very obviously flirting with the first boyfriend of mine I've ever introduced to her. The highlight of the evening being her fellating two hookah mouthpieces while giving my boyfriend the \"fuck me\" eyes after eating raw oysters and waxing poetic about their aphrodesiac qualities while staring this boy *down* (I would think troll, but she's incapable of it.). As for the two of us, he looked like a scared bunny rabbit and I was torn between figuring out how I'd fallen into the Twilight Zone and pulling a Sassy Gay Friend on her ass and asking,\"What, what, what are you doing?\". I settled for staring and promising my traumatised manboy that he would never have to hang out with the crazy lady ever again.\n\nMy ex was the only one who'd had more than a single beer.\nTL;DR:"}

She doesn't take it seriously and assumes every marriage is like this once there's kids.\n\nWe've tried \"scheduling\" it, doesn't work. We have date nights, I exercise 5-6x a week and don't neglect personal hygiene. I tell her how beautiful she is. Sometimes she appreciates it, sometimes she prefers I wouldn't (such as when she has yoga pants on) because she knows/thinks it means I'm digging her buns (I am).\n\nBut ultimately, wtf? I know there's more to life than lust and I'm patient with the reality but I can't simply ignore my needs as a man/human. Before kids and even after our first we were still intimate.

Eventually we learned each other's names, exchanged phone numbers, and all that good stuff. (I somehow didn't bother to ask his age until a week ago, I thought he was 30 to 32)We get pretty flirty over text (I initiated the flirting, and let him know I was interested) and greatly enjoy talking with each other when we can find the time. \n\nHe works in the field that I really want to get into, and told me about his plans to open up his own place that would offer apprenticeships so he could help people who can't afford school still get their license. You should have seen his face when I told him that I actually wanted to work in his field! He was so excited for me and helped me think of some options if I do decide to go to school (and he said he would leave an apprenticeship spot open for me if I wanted to learn that way instead)\n\nI'm unsure if I'm finding myself so strongly attracted to him because he seems to have so much more wisdom than me, if it's his positive outlook on life, or even just that he seems to know what he wants to do with his life and is taking the steps to accomplish his goals. (My ex gave up on his goals pretty much as soon as there was any resistance. No amount of encouraging gave him any kind of spark of interest in his dreams again)\n\nAnyway, I would love to start something with this person who is very much attracted to me physically and as a person, but I'm unsure of anything I should know about such a large age gap.

I apologize in advance for any ambiguity.\n\nRecently broke up with first major girlfriend (We will call it a 3 year relationship). We met through a shared group of friends and naturally maintained that same group of friends throughout our relationship. During our relationship I had some minor transgressions with one of her friends. Nothing unforgivable but definately some questionable moments while drunk and my (at the time) girlfriend expressed a strong dislike of both my actions and the friend in question. Now, it can also be noted that I have expressed a strong fear (I guess you could call it) regarding my ex sleeping with any of my current friends. And yet, somehow, I've become the one to do this to her.  Over the passed few months I've been trying to create a friendly relationship with my ex. I will always love her and I honestly had (deep-down) hoped that someday we could try to be together again and now that I've slept with her friend, I feel there is no chance to ever try again. I would feel horrible if I dated her again and never told her about this instance with her friend. \n\nI also want to note that the friend and I agreed not to tell anyone about this happening, but I'm slightly worried that this will come out at some point in the future and it will destroy any possibility of even a friendship with my ex and possibly the shared friends. We were drunk and it was undoubtedly a selfish mistake.\n\nSo, I guess my questions for you guys are:\n\nIs it okay if I remain friends with the ex without her knowing?\nAm I a horrible person?\nShould I avoid 1 on 1 interactions between myself and the friend?\nIf I do end up dating the ex at some point in the future (say, a year from now), is this something that I should keep to myself or something I should bring out into the open and hopefully move passed?\n\nOr if you have any advice or personal experiences regarding similar experiences Im sure I would enjoy hearing about those as well.\nTL;DR:"}

We dated about 4.5 months before she had to move for her job. After that we've been long distance. Lately however, she has been distancing herself. We got back from a vacation and she wanted me to focus on doing things for myself. I took her advice to heart and decided to set goals for myself so I'd something to work for. She seemed really happy with my progress. \n\nFrom there things went downhill FAST. Shortly after she told me she wasn't happy and wanted to break up. Then she called today demanding her stuff back. It's all happening so fast. She keeps saying I need to find my own happiness and that I can't rely on her. I understand what she is saying, I just disagree right now I'm going through a really hard time. It's hard to find happiness when you're dealing with some of the things I'm going through. As humans we aren't going to be happy 24/7 365. Marriages aren't always going to be perfect, you gotta live what life gives you.

This isn't an every night thing. We work at the same nine to five job(it's a call center job so we don't get much time to actually see each other there) and then I work a second job 4 nights a week.

Basically my eyes will start getting kind of itchy if I'm around a cat for a couple hours. My girlfriend and I went to a cat cafe in New York City once, and within an hour my eyes got extremely itchy and I was rubbing them constantly. It got better when I made it a point not to touch my eyes though. When I slept on the floor of a friend's apartment who had a cat, it took a while for my eyes to get itchy, but eventually they did. It was bearable, but a little uncomfortable. I have no respiratory symptoms whatsoever, and it doesn't happen every time I'm around cats, but it usually does.\n\nNow my girlfriend would really like to own a cat one day, and we've also been talking about moving in together in the future. She doesn't want to get a cat if it's possible I'm allergic though, but I feel bad because I know she'd really like one.\n\nI've been reading up on allergies, and I've read that with proper cleaning and the right breed I can probably be mostly fine. Many years ago I decided I really liked the idea of a Russian Blue, because I find their coats really beautiful, and apparently they are especially friendly cats. To my surprise I found out that they're considered somewhat hypoallergenic! For my symptoms would that be a good choice?\n\nOne issue though: we've always wanted to rescue from a shelter, rather than get from a breeder or something, and a russian blue from a shelter will probably be next to impossible. All of the ones I'm seeing online are probably domestic shorthair mixes, or worse, some other breed entirely. My question is, would a mix be okay for my mild allergies? Or should I be looking into something else entirely?\nTL;DR:"}

I probably would, too, if I had time at home alone like he does - in fact, I used to a lot, but now that the tables are turned it bothers me, and I honestly can't figure out why. He'd never watch porn while I'm home - what's the point, when something better is right in front of him, you know? But somehow just knowing that he's jacked off while I'm at work makes me so uncomfortable that I start shivering uncontrollably and my heart races like mad, like a panic attack. It's so fucking weird. I've literally lost about ten pounds in the last month, just from stressing out over this. I've even gone so far as to check his browser history and stuff, which I feel awful about. It's not like me to be so intrusive and mistrustful.\nI know that he goes on video chat sites, and he's on fetlife. Maybe that's what bugs me, that he's watching people that he could get to know rather than just videos? But when I think about it logically, I know that that shouldn't bother me either, 'cause I know he's committed to me and cares about me a great deal.\nI just don't know what's wrong with me. I'm no prude, and I get the need to just satisfy yourself sometimes. I've never been with anyone that's made me as sexually satisfied as him, but if I had time alone I'd probably still masturbate anyway. I dunno. My logical and emotional sides are at war, and my health is getting fucked over cause of it. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

I met this girl around 10 years ago and have liked (maybe even loved) her ever since. She has almost always had a boyfriend and we've always been good friends. We would hang out often and I've come close to telling her how I feel a few times. Well 3 years ago I moved to a different state and we stopped talking completely for no reason other than distance I guess. I often think of her and recently I decided to text her and see how she was doing. We texted back and forth for a couple of days, mainly small talk. She's doing well and has another boyfriend, etc. so my question is should I just tell her how I feel? Would it even have any meaning now? I don't want to put her in an awkward position and not speak to her for another 3 years. And how would I even bring it up?\nTL;DR:"}

I graduated highschool with a 3.5 gpa and a 1800 sat score (28 on ACT'S).  My first semester my grades were nowhere near what I've come to expect from myself.  I finished with a 2.48 gpa with 16 credit hours.\n\nEverything feels very stagnant, so I've deduced a plan.  After this semster I want to take a year off of school. I'm going to force myself to get my grades up (really hoping for a 3.5 this semester)  I know my dad will let me move back in, although admittedly he won't be incredibly supportive of my decision.  I want to get a 9-5 job making whatever money they wanna give me,I'm honestly willing to do anything.  Get some savings, built up, and transfer to a school somewhere warm but further from home.  \n\nMy concern is that I'm afraid it will be incredible disruptive, especially in terms of final aid and loan eligibility.

She was going to her friend's (friend A) house and another friend (friend B) tagged along. They got drunk which is usual so I wasn't worried and we had already established limits on to how much she could drink. Well tonight friend B got a little touchy. My GF expressed interest in wondering what it would be like to kiss another girl and asked if I would be okay with it, I responded no, I wasn't comfortable with her kissing friend B because friend B was a known bisexual. After about 20 minutes of radio silence I get a text from my GF saying they made out. An hour later I get another text saying she was stripping and friend A was trying to keep her clothes on (she was designated driver) while friend B was encouraging her. At this point I was already upset and told GF that I wasn't comfortable with this. Another 20 minutes of radio silence and I get another text, \"Friend B went down on me\" She later claimed it was a joke, but that Friend B had tried but GF kept on denying her.\nI personally feel like she's cheated on me but nothing like this has happened to me before so I would appreciate some advice.\nTL;DR:"}

There, we made a lot of friends, but one of them seems to be a bit more for my girlfriend for 2 years, whom I share my flat with.\n\nYesterday, around a week after coming back, I started my laptop to prepare it for work next day, and her facebook was still logged in. It was around 2 am. I didn't notice instantly, as I had chrome on background, but suddenly chat sounds started coming and I watched a conversation unfold between her and this guy. It was, I guess, an ongoing chat, as they started speaking very intimately. She was really pushing for it, sad about nothing happening back there between them, and flirting and teasing him, in the end she even told him if she wasn't with me, she would be with him. Then adding I should never know about that. The chat went on up to 4am.\n\nI am always 100% loyal and I have always given my best in the relationship, so I don't tolerate this kind of stuff, but the guy lives in another country and it's impossible for them to meet.\n\nSubtlely trying to get her to talk to me about it gave no results, she acts as if nothing has happened.\n\nWhat do I do now?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Would it lower my credit score to pay off a personal loan 9 months early?\nPOST: In February, I took out an 18 month, $5,000 unsecured loan to pay for a new laptop computer.  This was mainly because I wanted to start building a credit history for myself (24/M, recent college grad).  I have a steady, full-time job that pays decently and a bit of money the bank that I am saving up to use for graduate school in 1-2 years.  \n\nPrior to taking out the loan, my only credit history was a starter credit card that I'd paid off in full every months for 6 months straight (my dad had to cosign the loan).  I had enough money at the time (and still do) to pay in full for all my expenses.  I keep up with budgets and live within my means.  Overall, I feel like I'm pretty responsible with my money. *In short, paying for the computer was never an issue.*\n\nThe loan maturation date is not until August 2013, but I am tempted to pay it off by about next February because I want to save as much money as possible for grad school.  However, I've heard that paying off certain loans early will actually lower your score since the lender would not actually make any profit from you.  If this is the case, I'd rather continue to pay the minimum amount per month until it matures.  Any advice?\n\nTo clarify before anyone asks why I would need $5,000 for a computer: that was the lowest principal amount I could find at a banking institution, and the banker who authorized the loan is a family friend who gave me a good interest rate.\nTL;DR:"}

Lately, they have been having problems (been on and off).  Today, she just broke up with him, stating that she didn't want to be with him any more.  Her reasoning was that she saw a guy she likes and it got her thinking.  She started thinking about how it would be easier to be with a guy in Mexico rather than having a long distance relationship.  Later she tells him she doesn't want to lose him, and now she is back to not wanting to be with him.  My buddy has always been there for her.  He made a trip down to Mexico to see her, upon her request, even when they weren't together.  He takes time out of his day (blows his boys off) to talk to her on the phone, etc.  Anyways, I told him that he needs to move on.  I told him it wouldn't be easy, but he needs to start to make a disconnect.  Meaning stop calling her every moment he gets, stalking her FB page, and just trying to get her out of his mind.  I don't know if I am giving him the right advice.  I basically told him to back off and let her talk to you, is this good advice?  What else should I tell him?  Also, she manipulates the fights they get into, and she twists them to being his fault.  She is basically causing him to suffer in school and generally putting him is a depressed state of mind which affects his friendship with me and the other guys.  Help me tell him what to do.

This is dangerous because to pass you have to bike by in the oncoming lane. The curtious and smart thing to do is loudly announce \"On your left!\" Before passing. I had just been working up the courage to sarcastically say \"On your right!\" When the next person passed unannounced. When this man passed by suddenly, I quickly yelled out \"ON YOUR RIGHT!\" WAY to loudly. Fortunately this story does not conclude with me being pushed over and having the shit kicked out of me, but rather me realizing this guy was wearing a Reddit shirt (uniform, whatever.

I was busy with my GRE preparations so whatever free time I had, I used to spend with her. I started connecting to her emotionally no matter how much I tried to avoid. \nNow few days back we had a talk. I don't know why, she started saying that she doesn't want to spoil this friendship. I got the gist of the talk so I backtracked. \nBut now the problem is not this, the main issue is that she started saying sorry time and again and kept on saying that she don't want to cut off the ties. She keeps on messaging and plead me to keep the status as it was earlier before all it happened. I don't want to hurt her but continuing this is painful. \nI'm in a dilemma and will really appreciate some opinions\nTL;DR:"}

We do not currently live together, but I spend a majority of my days with her, either sleeping at her place or mine. We have few arguments, although we do have disagreements with each other and petty grievances (we are both only children).\n\nI am contemplating moving in with her next fall, mainly on pragmatic grounds. It would be mutually beneficial; we both would save money on rent, will be able to pool resources, have more total space, benefit from each of our offerings (her cooking / my cleaning + shared material benefits). Neither us of have ever lived with an SO and the thought of moving in together is both daunting and exciting. I am thinking optimistically and considering how much we could both grow from the experience -- how it would present challenges, makes us more responsible, prepare us for similar experiences later on in life.\n\nI get there are drawbacks and risks associated with the move. We've only been together for a short-period of time. It is difficult to know at this point if we will want to jump on this idea in 4-6 months from now. Being only children and both very controlling, we will definitely have trouble sharing space, (e.g. I tend to be very clean, her very messy.) We both, to some degree, are limited in our adulthood experiences and problem-solving abilities -- We are both still undergrad students and will be next year. She is concerned that she won't have enough space.. that signing the lease would make it difficult to get out of the relationship (at least for a year) and would tie us down. She has poor benchmarks (previous experiences have taught her that she tires from BFs she spends a lot of time with). I argue we will be so busy with school and work (for me) that this won't be the case. That we already spend an incredible amount of time together, that this will not be unexplored terrain.\n\nCan anyone offer their thoughts on living with a SO for the first time?

They pull back, leave you wondering, then I get hurt and we get into a argument about something that wasn't even a problem. I think I may have a security issue, cause he's told me so many times to chill and stop worrying about him leaving. That just because we're not like that all the time doesn't means his feelings have changed. I know he's right, but I just don't get why boys do that..?

Will start dating when I am ready, but just a natural curiosity (breakup is still fresh) to find out if there's any hope of rekindling something in future.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [20M] want to ask out my friend/coworker [23F] but not sure what is the best approach.\nPOST: I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. I've been working this retail job for about six months and during that time I've gotten to be pretty good friends with my coworker. Around New Years we both split from our longtime SOs (in my case, girlfriend of 5 years, pretty much my entire mature life to this point, which is why I need to ask for advice with this!). Now I'm thinking about asking if she wants to get together as more than friends. I'm not the biggest stud in the world but I'm good at making her laugh and she's opened up to me with some personal stuff which she apparently doesn't tell many people.\n\nI've got two big concerns. One is that even though I'm totally cool with her saying no if she's not interested, I don't want our friendship to get hurt by me having asked. I figure if I ask her pretty casually; confidently but with minimal pressure on her and letting her know I'm cool staying friends if she doesn't want to, then the potential damage is minimal. But then again it's been ages since I've had to ask anyone out so I figured I'd see if my wonderful friends on reddit could shed light on how you would feel if your friend asked you out like this.\n\nSecond concern is how I should ask her. Asking her at work would be kind of awkward because... it's work. There's usually other coworkers there or at least customers we need to be helping. So I thought since it's just a casual sort of thing and not a marriage proposal or anything I could ask her over text, but is that weird too? Or is 2016 a new and enlightened age where asking someone out over text is fine? We already text and snapchat pretty frequently so it wouldn't be out of the blue.\nTL;DR:"}

From family issues, to personal issues, to fights you name. We always go through it and we were always stronger afterwards. Not this time it seems. Let me just say that I love her more than anything in the world. Nothing could ever change that. She's my lover and my best friend. We've done so much together, beaten every pokemon game, halo game, run a pokemon league all that nerdy cute stuff. After starting a new and intensive school, however, this has changed. The school has a lot of work on our plate and it causes immense amounts of stress. I've been easily upset and find it a little difficult not letting people know that and get kind of physically distraught. She is more of one to keep things inside. To skip to the chase, after a fight in the parkinglot everything exploded. She's trying to say things like she hasn't loved me in a long time and it's been hollow. She has forced me away no matter how much love I try to show or sweet little heart note I send. I have my problems and probably do rely on her too much with school things, but all I want to do is change and for once in our lives she won't let me. She's not giving me the chance, she's contorting things I said to sound worse, and now blaming me for all of her problems and saying I was always making her unhappy. She's said the meanest things in the world, but dammit reddit I love this girl. I've gone through too much with her not to. I'm giving her space and hoping for the best. What should I do? I'm so hurt and confused. Not too long ago she was telling me I'm alright and she loves me. Now she says it was a lie.\nTL;DR:"}

We did things together that I don't think I can ever do with another woman.

Her decision to break up with me is totally against her character and everything I have come to believe about her since we started dating. I know she wasn't cheating on me because she also had a very difficult time dealing with the breakup, but the fact that she did it at all makes no sense to me.\n\nI guess my question is, should I break no-contact and try to figure things out, or should I just give up on her?

After speaking with someone from LFG on the phone, friend was told that in order to do so, he needed to mail the machine back, which he did through certified mail to confirm it was received. Later, LFG sends letters that say he owes hundreds (I think it was around 700) for the equipment and for cancelling a noncancelable contract. Then receives legal threat letters saying he will be sued if he does not pay whatever amount. Fast forward to this year, where he finds that there are mysterious deductions from his bank account for over 10,000 that just says \"legal fee.\" Asked his bank and they said it was from a garnishment in NY with a phone number, and they don't have more info but he needs to call that number.  It's a number to a legal office for LFG. Is this allowed and any advice on what he should do?\nTL;DR:"}

I'll start...\nPOST: My parents are very generous at Christmas with my cousins' gifts, but somehow one year it wasn't enough.  My parents bought him and his brothers A GO-KART.  I dreamed of a go-kart as a kid.  They were so excited to see their faces when they revealed the gift to the three boys.  Well, naturally they freaked out and were overwhelmed with happiness and excitement when they got it.  At least two of them were... One of them, lets call him \"Henry\" is completely stoic.  He doesn't run up to the go-kart and get excited like the other two; he stays completely still and expressionless, then walks inside and goes to the basement.  We were all really puzzled so I went in to talk to him.  He was sitting with his head down on a table and arms folded.  I kept asking him why he didn't want to go test drive the go-kart.  Then i tried prying his head off the table and I realized that Henry was crying.  Tears streaming down his face.  Then, finally he burst and started screaming \"I DONT WANT A FUCKING GO KART I WANTED A MAC LAPTOP\" and starts bawling is visibly furious.  He was so angry and upset that my parents bought him a go-kart and not a mac, that he was screaming crying.  My mom was just in a state of shock and quietly said to herself \"I thought all boys liked go karts...\" My Dad and grandma were yelling at him for how ruthlessly spoiled and selfish Henry was.  I was livid seeing the kid act like such a brat, but at the same time i was laughing to myself because it was just so ridiculous.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: -SERIOUS- I got my student loans written off, but now that its tax time...\nPOST: I had my student loans written off last year ($64,000 and around $5,000 interest). I had to go in and out of school several times due to my condition. Being a private school (Not-For-Profit) didn't help matters either.\n\nI received my 1099-C form in the mail a few days ago. I entered in the corresponding information into the tax software, and it comes up that I owe around $11,500 Federal and $4,500 state.\n\nI made around $13,000 last year.\n\nI have virtually no assets. I don't own a car (I sold it to pay off previous medical bills/insurance). I now have Medicaid though. Seriously my computer is the most expensive thing I have @ $500, and maybe a little more worth in clothes.... And yes I will be moving in with a family member to get out rent-free :/\n\n-----\nSo how do I go about paying this off?\n-\n\nOne of the first stipulations of getting these loans written off is making sure that you don't make any money. I cannot exceed the Federal set income poverty line for a family of 2 for 2015. Approx. $15,000.\n\nThe only 3 ways I know are: 1. Payment Plan. 2. Garnishment on wages. 3. Bankruptcy. The first two are pretty much the same thing in my situation. I am going to be paying it back no-matter what, and probably as soon as possible. Bankruptcy is something that I don't know a whole lot about, and I am not sure would be good in my situation for such a small amount of debt.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am very grateful for everyone that helped me get my student loans forgiven. Family, friends, doctors, Department of Social Security, and The Dept. of Education. I know this will likely end up being a year or two of hell paying this back to the IRS. This debt is still pocket change compared to the original student loans that I had. **I just didn't feel like I made close to $82K last year....\nTL;DR:"}

We were both each other's first and only significant others (not counting the stupid week long relationships everyone has in 8th grade), and neither of us have had any romantic or sexual experiences with anyone else. She's a beautiful, smart, funny, and sweet girl, and she's really amazing, especially since we got to college (we go to the same school), since she's really come out of her shell.\n\nBut lately, like the past 6 months or so, I've started to feel...well, weird. I don't look forward to hanging out with her anymore. Instead of saying to myself \"Oh boy, I **get** to go hang out with Sally!\" (her name isn't Sally, by the way), I usually say \"Well, now I **have** to go hang out with Sally.\" I usually have a great time once I get there, but I never look forward to it before hand. It doesn't help that she's one of those girls who doesn't like silences much, so will keep talking no matter what, often retelling me the same stories over and over again, usually with an exact script.\n\nAnd, like I said, we've been together for four, almost five years. At our age, that's literally a quarter of our lives that we've spent with each other. I still think she's a great girl, but part of me says \"Hey, maybe your **real** soulmate is out there, and you're just not looking for her!\" But I feel like an asshole because she hasn't done anything to make me unhappy. \n\nI don't know. Do you guys think we just need to figure out something to spice things up? I just don't want to hurt her.\nTL;DR:"}

His reasoning was that he was sick of the things I did that made him feel like he was constantly questioning our relationship, but couldn't tell me a single thing that I was apparently doing. \n\nI love this guy with all my heart. I've done nothing but put him first the entire time we've been together, and it destroyed me when he broke up with me. I spent Sunday and Monday lying in bed watching zombie movies and crying, and Tuesday at school I had an emotional breakdown in the middle of one class, and spent the others with my head on whatever table like surface I was sitting at. \n\nTuesday afternoon/night: I go rehearsal for an upcoming play, then go  out with some friends to get my mind off things. We go out to eat, goof off in Walmart, and then head home. The entire time I felt really happy, and today carried on the same way. I even got the thought that moving on was going to be easier than expected, and I can't wait to get back into meeting new people. I'm young, and although I had hoped my guy and me would have stayed together longer, I can't help but feel like I can do better.\n\nThe thing is, it's only been a few days. Just over 24 hours ago I was a mess, trying to hide my phone from myself so I wouldn't text him, and attempting to keep myself away from his facebook page. Now I feel like I'm ready to move on...or do I? I'm not really sure how to feel about this. I miss him, and I love him...and it's only been a few days...I can't be over him already, can I?\nTL;DR:"}

The relationship started good and we got pregnant within the first 6 months. Two years into the relationship she met a guy online, nothing got physical as he lived multiple states away. However there were some pretty discerning messages shared between the two. That's when my distrust kicked in. Three years later I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Now we will skip ahead to year number 9. I find messages on fb about how she was going to leave me as soon as I got better, and how much of an emotional train wreck I put her through. Granted due to mistrust, it wasn't easy I was always asking if we were doing good and asking if there was anyone else. Not to mention a couple times going through some fb posts, and text messages. I also find out around this time she developed feelings for a coworker. Now we're gonna skip to present day. A month ago is when I found out about what happened during year 9, and to top everything off I also found out she sent a nude to one of my best friends. Now she hasn't been all there either, dealing with my distrust, and depression, and the fact that for the last 5 years we've tried to have a baby and can't. So I know she was in a bad place herself. I want to make this work with her I honestly do. We've talked about it and she says the same. I know that in order for that to happen I have to be able to regain trust in her. I don't know how, or where to begin. I hated going through her stuff I really did but I felt it was necessary for what originally happened to never happen again. I realize now I was wrong. How do I learn to forgive, and to regain trust in my SO?\nTL;DR:"}

While I'm semi-interested in actually dating her she's only interested in the attention, which I'm fine with since thats my reason for this too. \n\nThis seemed fine to me, but she started crying during sex last time and told me she felt guilty with sleeping with me as shes still in love with her ex. Her and her sex split only a few months ago so its not a huge suprise she's not over him. She's told me she's been with a few guys in between me and her ex and has felt just as guilty. I'm not sure if I should stop seeing her or not. While we both want us to keep seeing each other I'm worried that the guilt she feels with when she's with me is terrible for her emtional well-being. \n\nAlso I feel like if we keep doing this I might actually get real romantic emotions for her too. This is something I honestly would rather avoid at the moment despite a bit of me wanting to. I'm leaving next summer for school so getting attached like that would not be a good thing for either of us. This is on top of the fact that she still has not got over her ex yet.

I say this because she didn't talk too much to me.

I think that I could relate to this girl and at the very least would like to offer to talk to her some time. The kind of person I aspire to be is compassionate enough to want to help strangers like this, and I also see this as a test of confidence because generally my social anxiety wouldn't let me approach someone in this manner but I feel that I need to fight through these things in order to overcome them.\n\nThe question that I'm asking is basically if it would be considered 'weird' or socially unacceptable for me to, next time I see this girl around, say something to the effect of \"Hey, I know you don't know me but I saw you pretty upset in the hall the other day and I just wanted to say that if you ever want to talk to someone about anything or just get a different perspective, I would totally be willing to talk.

What should I do?\nPOST: 19 year old here and apologies if any of this sounds \"stalkerish\" but I started following this girl on Twitter randomly a few months ago because I was following a hashtag at the time on a show I liked, she tweeted something really funny so I followed her. At the time I didn't really think much towards her; she was a compete stranger, but she was kinda cute. But that was all I knew about her and I didn't really give her much attention.\n\nBut few weeks after I started following her, she tweeted out this quote that I found amazing and original. So chasing after my curiosity, I started kinda stalking her Twitter for a bit to see what she was all about. I didn't think to find much but oh boy, I did. Turns out this girl is FUCKING amazing. All her past tweets are so funny, her philosophy on life is absolutely beautiful and so positive, and she has this gorgeous sense of fashion. And honestly, she's gotten about 100x more physically beautiful since I started to get a feel for who she is as a person. Granted, she's a still a stranger and I'm probably missing a lot of details about her but still. I've been following her stuff ever since but she doesn't know who I am or that I exist really.\n\nI've been single and have dating different girls for 6 months now but none of them as perfect for me, like this girl. She honestly seems like my perfect type of girl from what I've seen the past few months. She goes to a university that's two hours from mine (her bio) and is the same age. What should I do about this?\nTL;DR:"}

A while later, Sarah wanted a relationship with Jack but at that point, Jack had met Diane (the girlfriend). One day, Jack and Sarah went out to dinner and he told her \"I'm dating Diane now so nothing can happen between us\"\n\nThe girlfriend wasn't invited to the dinner because Jack told her it was just dinner with a friend. MONTHS later, Diane found out that Jack and Sarah were a little bit more than just friends.   Since Diane found out, she's been weary of their relationship. Jack promised not to text her. However, Diane went out of town one weekend and came back to find out Jack and Sarah had been texting.\n\nJack and Diane broke up and Jack and Sarah started texting again. Eventually Jack and Diane got back together but Sarah kept texting. Recently, Jack bought a house and told Sarah this. When Sarah asked, \"who's living with you?\" Jack refused to text her back and tell her Diane was moving with him. Until finally Jack texted Sarah and said \"Diane is renting a room\". NOT \"we're moving in together\" but \"Diane is renting a room in my house\" Sarah replied \"What an interesting setup!\"\n\nJack refused to text back after that. Who's in the wrong?

That's where the tifu happened.\n\nI was on my iphone and pressed create new contact, he was right beside me looking at my phone. That was when I realized that all those times I've been only calling him \"dude\" and \"bro\". So I was at the text box for the First name and for a good 5-10 seconds my fingers were just there and I was just staring at my screen realizing my mistake..... Trying to recall his name. At the time, simply asking for his name did not come to my mind and so I just wrote a random name which was \"Renzo\" (i don't know why I guess I thought he looked like a Renzo) and proceeded to ask for his number...\n\nI had to search his name on my friends list on facebook to know his name.\n\nWe haven't talked about the incident but I'm sure he remembers.

For the past 3 years I have had a 11 P.M. curfew, forced to attend church on Sundays (Been threated to move out if I don't attend), and are upset by me not sharing my personal life/daily experience. My parents are very restrictive, and although it was beneficial during my adolescnets, now its really \"Cramping my style\" So to speak. \n\nIf I did choose to commute it would save me alot of strife by not having to get new jobs / spending money, but I would want the freedom to take weekend trips at will (Without permission) or to stay at others houses (Without permssion) or to not be forced to go to church.

I've had a crush on her since I met her and it's only now that I feel I can make things happen with her in a month when college starts back.\n\nThe reason as to why I feel I can make things happen is also the source of my problem. You see three weeks ago I'd sent Dani a long message (our conversations always consisted of each of us sending walls of text). Yesterday she replied with yet another wall of text, told me she'd been working and kept forgetting to reply. I understood I've often done that as well so no biggie we continued talking as we had previously.\n\nAND now here's where the problem begins. In this three week period I hooked up with a friend of mine, whom we'll call Jane, and began to have feelings for her. Just last week we found that we both liked each other and decided to see where things go, \"nothing serious\" to quote her. Anyway then just yesterday after Dani got back in contact with me I came to the realisation that I have much stronger feelings for Dani than I do for Jane, although I still care for Jane a great deal and appreciate her friendship immensely.\n\nSo my question is this, how do I end and properly explain things to Jane while keeping our friendship relatively intact.\nTL;DR:"}

This disappointed my dad immensely. I haven't gotten a job yet but I've been applying and looking. However, my dad constantly rides me about working and how I'm irresponsible and need to man up and all of that stuff. I barely see him, my parents are split and I'm always with my mom, but go to see my dad like three days every two weeks, you can see why. Every waking moment I am with him, even when I'm not, he is just on my case about it, making me feel like a total failure in his eyes. We are always fighting and arguing, and the first words he says when I finally see him are always job related, ruining the entire time I'm with him. I never hear a \"How's it going?\" or anything nice. I just need to know how I should tell him he is running me out of his life, and if he ever IS proud of me, I'll be too driven away to care.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by inventing a rule in \"King of Drinking\"\nPOST: (You may know it as \"King's Cup\" (there is an /r/AskReddit thread that reminded me; this happened a few months ago but I didn't know /r/tifu existed then) or by another name; a drinking game where each card has a different rule you must complete if you draw it).\n\nI was at a house party, an already quite awkward one where not many people knew each other, other than the host, and we were playing a drinking game to try and get it started.\n\nI pulled a 'rule card', a jack, this meant I could define a rule to last for the rest of the game. Some people are creative, some people panic when put on the spot and pick an easy overused rule. This was the option I took, stating my rule was to be \"left handed drinking only, or you have to down your drink\". It's actually an horrendously difficult rule to follow for an entire game and a rare concession to the most oppressed in our society, lefties.\n\nThere was no laughter. There was not even groans at me picking such an overused rule. There was just silence. Clearly awkward silence. I'm not sure if people actually parted aside or if my realisation caused me have some kind of horror moving 'zooming in' effect. There, smiling awkwardly at me, was my friend with only one arm. Her right arm. \n\nWe'd been friends all through university, I simply don't think of her as \"the girl with one arm\", she is just my friend. How I fucked up was by unwittingly drawing attention to it at a party where she was already quite uncomfortable surrounded by people she didn't know very well. She was fine, we giggled about it on later days, but the entire tone of that party seemed to change after that - the drinking game was already a desperate attempt to get it started.\n\nI got very drunk in response and on my way home urinated on a cat: it was hiding in the bush I chose as a public toilet and ran out, only once I had finished (the filthy bastard), looking soggy and cross. This is unrelated but makes me happy and changes the night into a more pleasant memory.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by writing \"I'm gay\" on a buddy's computer in SC.\nPOST: So, this happened about three years ago, like every TIFU.\n\nBut today I saw one of my friends get pranked with the good 'ol \"Guys, I think it's time I came out and told you all that I'm gay.\" status while leaving their computer/phone unattended. Well, it reminded me of one of my first experiences when I came to the US during high school (My dad was military so I spent most of my life abroad). \n\nYou see, I made a couple of acquaintances that I considered to be pretty decent friends, and being a dick to your friends was all the rage back then, so I decided to go ahead and do exactly what 90% of all friends did to each other and wrote \"I'm gay\" as a status. \n\nNow, in most of these cases what ends up happening is that a bunch of people think it's mildly amusing as a \"Haha, that's what you get for leaving your shit out\" moment, a couple of scoffs at the immaturity, and a very few people that are out of the loop (usually aunts and grandmothers) that are either concerned or supportive.\n\nWell, I had underestimated the back-woodedness of living in the capital of South Carolina and apparently nobody heard of this being a thing, so this kid ended up getting a lot of shit from friends and family because if they're backwards enough to not get the joke, then they're backwards enough to immediately disown the poor fuck without questioning anything. Most of his friends (and some of his family) started being dicks to him because they were all homophobic dicks and didn't believe that somebody would prank somebody with something as sinful as gayness (because sin is not a joke).  \n\nSo the guy hated my guts because he couldn't fathom why anybody would do such a cruel thing as a joke and he pretty much tried to fight me every time we ran into each other. I eventually get detention or suspention or something, and the school had an assembly about cyber bullying.\nTL;DR:"}

So, she says she will stop the smoking but she will still vape (which still bothers me but I'm okay with it).

I'm trying to get explain to her that a cigarette is harmful but she won't listen and keeps saying I don't care.\n\nI really don't want her to do this. I don't want her getting caught by her parents, getting caught by my parents and then them telling me to break up with her, I don't want her to suffer in the future because she wants to get off of cigs but can't.

We still act like we used to, text each other every day and hang out.\n\nThere is something i think i should bring up, we slept with each other after we ended the relationship. We both talked about it before hand and didnt know if it was a good idea (as we were both virgins before this) but went along with it. After that she has seemed to be, a little more attached? She answers her texts within 10-20 mins now, before it would take her at least a couple hours. We do cuddle and have kissed even after this break up.\n\nThe other day i was on reddit and read about Ex's being 'best friends' and someone replied with \"You do know that nobody will be okay with is right?\" Is this actually true? Will potential girlfriends be turned away by this? Obviously the cuddling, kissing, and romantic/intimate notions will dissolve when one of us starts dating again.\n\nI talked with other friends about this (not mutual friends) and they said i should have left when we broke up.

I was in a very dark place for about a year, but friends and family helped me through.  I spent the next few years rebuilding myself.  I changed careers, started new hobbies, started living for myself, etc.  I know he'd be proud of me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I thought I'd start dating again.  I first asked if my friends knew any men, but I just didn't click with them.  Then I tried meeting men through hobbies and such, but many men around my age are already married or separated (I'm not keen on dating men still legally married).  I did meet some nice divorced men, but I just didn't feel much for them.\n\nThen I tried online dating, and it's just been disappointing.  No tinder or anything like that, but other sites.  A lot of the men are better looking than my husband was, sure, but no one has treated me as well as he did on the first few dates.  He picked me up, took me ice skating (neither of us knew how to skate actually), held my hand, and called the next day.  He was an absolute gentleman and I just...haven't met a whole lot of gentlemen, I guess.  I know no one's going to be exactly like he was, but it is disappointing when a guy suggests his apartment as a first date location or I receive a dick pic (Seriously?  I'm a grown woman, what is this?).  Paid sites have been slightly more promising, but I guess I'm just too old fashioned for a lot of those guys.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, there have been a few I've liked, but I don't think I've felt mutual attraction at all, it's always unreciprocated on one end.

She can invite whoever the hell she wants. So I sat down this evening to watch some Netflix, when I happened to check my girlfriends snapchat story.

Basically it was a base with a pool, good food, and a few silly shows.\n\nOne of the few rules was an absolute ban on alcohol. Anyway, so I am coming back from the show and heading to the room and I look up and see some green lights glinting in the ceiling.

Naturally curious, I push on the metal plate to see if I could take it down and look at the light.\n\nSuddenly, the plate falls down and cuts a gouge in my hand. While simultaneously the world's largest fucking empty glass bottle of Smirnoff Vodka falls to the floor and shatters everywhere. At this moment the door opens and in walks one of the other platoon's commanders to check on the noise. So there I was, bleeding profusely from my hand onto the floor, standing above the shattered glass remains of the Smirnoff bottle. The officer sums up the situation in one glance and fury sets into his face.

The officer was looking beyond dubious, so I go all out. I refused to let him leave until he either believed me or got me tested for alcohol immediately. I figured that I could prove in that moment only that I had not been drinking. The last thing I needed was for him to tell my officer the next day when I had no way to prove I hadn't been drinking. Eventually my willingness to get tested convinced him and he ordered me to get my hand checked out and clean up the room. I still have a nice scar to show from the story.\nTL;DR:"}

I've posted a few now and all my friends who didn't already know about us have figured it out and generally seem happy for us.  But he's never posted a single picture of us together, on facebook, insta, anything, and he never responds to the pictures I post either.  He hasn't untagged himself though, so I don't exactly feel like he's hiding me.  It's just I can scroll just a little down on his profile and see the last photo he posted with his ex, and that shouldn't make me jealous but it kind of does.  He's very sweet and very good to me in a lot of ways, it's just the paranoia that's easy to fall into with LDR and not always feeling like he's proud to be with me that make me wonder if I should be worried.\n\nHe recently posted a picture with a good friend of his, so it's not like he just doesn't post pictures.

I felt like she was one of the only girl I could really talk to like that. So a couple days ago I went through an emotional experience and decided to tell her about my feelings now that she is single. I did not know if this was the right thing to do knowing that she had stuff going on and a lot on her mind, but I told her. I said that out of every girl I have meet, none of them compare to how much I care about her. She told me how sweet I was and how I am the nicest guy ever and how she didnt think it was wierd at all. I told her that I really would like for some day to be with her, but I know that right now it is not the best time to do so because she still has a lot on her mind because of her ex boyfriend. After talking to her I gave her a hug and kissed her on the cheek. I really like her and I dont know what to do. She said it wasnt wierd at all, but I think that im having a hard time getting over that. she is usually a girl I can just go up to and talk, but for these few couple days that have gone by I have been awkarwd i guess. I want to go to her room and talk to her like we used to, but idk. what can I do/ how do I handle this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

I asked her out once and was told \"I don't really know you, so not now\". I didn't do anything (actively avoided her because I'm a coward) then decided to man the fuck up a couple of months later and ask her again and she says she's in a relationship.\n\nThey broke up last week, because their relationship ended up being too intense for her bf. I happened to be around and was the shoulder to cry on and everything she said made her more beautiful to me. She wants exactly the same things as me in a relationship. She keeps baring her soul to me when singing (and I've done it to her as well) and she's just making herself so damn attractive.\n\nI've slept in the same bed as her twice, once after the break-up because I knew she wasn't sleeping and wanted to make sure she did and a couple of nights ago. I wasn't going to the second time because I had no idea whether she actually found me attractive but she seemed to be telling me to stay. So we had 4 people in this double bed and I spent the night cuddling up to her.\n\nI want to tell her that I've not wanted someone like this for a **long** time. But I've had to lie to her face because I didn't want to break her (the way she works is she gets really happy if she's made someone else happy, but sad as hell if she's hurt someone, and dammit I'm not hurting her).\n\nWhat the hell do I do? I can't not say something because that'll break her when I inevitably snap and she finds out, but if I move too soon I'll look like a vulture and might just be a replacement which would hurt me more.\nTL;DR:"}

Her and I click very well, and it was apparent from the first date (By the end of the first date it was like we had known each other forever, everything was going amazingly. Neither of us wanted it to end). \n\nThe major change that made me want to say it was that I had some surgery recently, nothing big, but surgery nonetheless. Later that night I went to her house for a bit. That night she put aside all of her responsibilities, chores, etc. everything to take care of me and make sure I was fine. I wasn't expecting anything more then just her sitting with me and we would talk, she went beyond what I expected. That night I almost said it, without thinking, like it was a reflex to say it. But I didn't, I was worried what she might say or how she'll take it, I don't want to rush things.\n\nAnother change was she's been telling me how much she appreciates having me, she's glad she met me, she loves the time she spends with me.

We've talked about it before, and I've explained that as long as it's always her making the decisions, and not blindly following her dad's every whim, then I'm 100% OK with it. The thing is, her dad has quite a big ego. He loves to talk about himself, loves to explain how everyone loved him at his old job, and they all want him back, and he was super popular and great and wonderful and blah blah blah. It's not like any of this organically comes up in conversation either, the guy just loves to hear his own voice. He never asks me questions about my work or schooling, though I frequently try to ask him friendly questions about his work.

I feel that we are a really good match for one another and can honestly see this relationship reach new heights.\n\nThat being said, she had one major boyfriend before me and she dated him for 3 years, but with a couple breakups.  She wasn't exactly faithful to him, having cheated on him a few times.  What's worse is that he only knew about the first time and decided to forgive her for it.  Admittedly, their relationship was strained because he went off to college while she was still in high school, but that doesn't excuse her actions in my opinion.  \n\nShe tells me that I'm a much better boyfriend than her ex was and that she was unhappy when she cheated on him.  But she seems to blame him for her unhappiness at the time and not take responsibility for her actions.  She seems ashamed of what she did, but she never admits total responsibility for her actions.  This bothers me, because I don't feel like she was really sorry for what she did.

She tells me that she could never dream about cheating on me because I'm so perfect, but I feel like that isn't the response I want to hear.  I'm very conflicted.  I completely trust her and feel like I shouldn't worry, but this small part of me is scared.  I have strong feelings for her and I am worried that I am going to get too attached before I get my heart broken one day.

I asked him if he had an information packet or something that I could leave to see if my parents were interested in an alarm system.\n\nHe asked when would be a good time to come back, that he did not have an information packet, and that he only had one copy of the voucher so I could not keep it.\n\nI lied and said they worked nights, and to come back during the day (this is a lie, my mother stays at home during the day, she had been gone just to pick up my sister).\n\nHe said he would be back some other time. We shook hands, he walked down the street, I went into my house.\n\nNow I'm sitting here wondering if he was casing my house, if the ADT sign was some sort of marker they would place for a future burglary, or if I'm just being paranoid.\n\nIf I was being cased, what should I do?

The problem is while I was there she was super friendly but since Ive come home ive found it incredible difficult to stay in touch with her. I message her on facebook but she so rarely uses it that theres no real point and I don't know whether texting or whatsapping is too.. imposing.

It will come across as arrogant but usually its not this difficult for me.\n\nEvery day that passes makes me want to talk to her more but i don't want to come across as some obsessive individual. So I don't know what I should do. We've exchanged 3 or 4 messages on facebook since then but thats about it.

I'm student currently studying at university and I participated in a social which involved a lot of other students meeting up at a bar near campus. Soon after meeting up my other fellow university friends, a girl came up to me and introduced herself.  We got talking and found that we both had very similar interests and our personalities clicked. After talking for a while (10 minutes or so), she told me she had to go find her housemates and asked me to take her number down so I could text her if I don't see here again. Now here's the weird thing; she takes forever to reply to texts. I'm not even exaggerating. It could take around a whole day for her to reply. Whats going on? I do consider the fact that she is a second year and does chemistry which is a tough course so she may not reply instantaneously but taking a whole day to reply? she doesn't even reply even if I reply to her text soon after she texts me. Did I screw up somehow or is she no longer interested? Keep in mind, she was not drunk and this happened on Wednesday 28th October. I would seriously like to know her better so some advice would be great!\nTL;DR:"}

Got a job in September for $42K before taxes (around $2400/month).  This job is in the same city as where my Dad lives, but because of his impossible personality, the strain on my relationship with him made me want to move.  Around this time I moved into a two bedroom apartment with a friend, started getting a Master's (offered scholarships being the driver), and loved having my own, albeit small, place to live.  Recently I made a decision that I need to buy a car.  One that is reliable enough for a while.  My concern is that I don't have enough money to save up for a used car.  I currently have $150 in the bank.  I have a $5k loan building interest, first payment must be done next year.  Here's my monthly expenses:\n\n* Rent: $600\n* Utilities, internet: $100\n* Phone: $60\n* Food/Groceries: $200\n* Tuition: $600\n* Gym: $30\n* Restaurants/Social: $100-200\n* Misc: $100\n* Savings to pay loan: ? (Hoping $400/month)\n* Savings for car: ? (Not sure what monthly savings should be for a decent car)\n\nMy Dad will charge me $400/month for rent, and probably utilities to keep myself in humane temperatures.  Dad voluntarily doesn't work (a huge different story involving his ego), and he changes his mind every single day on if he'd charge me rent and/if he is going to sell the huge house he lives in by himself.  \n\nIs the $200-$300/month in savings worth moving back with him, with the emotional baggage being a factor?  The only reason I'd want to do it is for better car savings, is there a way I can accomplish all expenses paid and still have my own apartment with my roomie?\nTL;DR:"}

She loved it and we agreed on a day that worked best for us. \n\nThe first one was coming up and it was the weekend of her roommate's birthday so she made plans to be with her Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night (conflicting with date night).

We haven't divorced yet, largely for financial reasons (we've both been struggling since the separation, just couldn't find the money for it).  Seven months ago I met my girlfriend.  She lives a few hours from me, but it's been great so far.  She's been planning on moving my way, looking for work here, we've been planning a future together, and we're crazy about each other.\n\nBut about a month and a half ago, she started getting distant and cagey, and wasn't very forthcoming about why.  I thought it was due to some life and family issues she had going on.  After a couple weeks of that, she canceled a trip to see me at the last moment, and told me that she was putting things between us on hold, and that she'd been getting increasingly bothered by the fact that I wasn't divorced yet.  So, I quickly sold some stuff and went to file the papers on my own, foregoing a lawyer.  I was hoping that at least starting the process would be enough, but nope...she maintains that until the divorce is final and I'm no longer legally married, there can be \"nothing between us\".\n\nSo, that's how it's been for a bit over a month now.  We still text each other sporadically, but she won't answer my phone calls and the texting is strictly platonic.  But as of yesterday, she's still saying that we're only \"on hold\", and that she's looking forward to resuming the relationship.  The divorce will probably wrap up around late February, maybe March.\n\nWhich brings me to my question...how do I handle Valentine's Day?  We're technically not \"together\" at the moment...but we're not really broken up, either.  I'm worried that if I do something romantic, she won't be receptive to it given the circumstances, and might even be upset that I'm disrespecting her stance and feelings.  But I'm also worried that if I do nothing, she'll be offended and hurt.\nTL;DR:"}

I simply am wondering how to know if your SO is \"the one\", so to speak, in spite of the little annoyances that pop up in any relationship. \n\nBackground: I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for just over a year now, and I recently moved into his apartment. Things between us are generally very good: we were friends for a few years before dating, love each other very much, have great sex, have the same general plans for the future regarding kids, location, etc. \n\nHowever, like any relationship, there are definitely ways in which we are different that cause minor rifts in our relationship. For example, he is very good at communicating when he is upset, whereas I am much more closed off and still working on being 100% open with my feelings. I had some pretty bad trauma in my previous relationship, which I know is the source of this, and I've gotten much better at this since we've been dating, but I know it is a source of frustration for him when we get into disagreements. On my end, I am much more affectionate and \"lovey\" than he is. I like to do little chores for him around the house, write him notes, buy him little treats as a surprise, etc. He knows this kind of affection is important to me, and he has gotten much better at doing this as well since we started dating. \n\nI guess I'm just wondering, when is it worth it to think that we should just break up so he can find someone who has his preferred communication style and I can find someone who loves to express affection like I do? I feel like a traitor even saying this, because we DO love each other greatly. And I know all relationships take work, but I guess my question is, how much is too much work in day o day life?\nTL;DR:"}

It was a 7 month relationship and i had really started developing feelings for her so in a way it was good we came to the decision when we did. I'm still really sad about it and wish we could have worked things out but it just wasn't in the cards. this is where I need your guys's opinion. I went to the casino tonight with a group of friends to take my mind of things. There was a girl there who wanted to date me in the past but i wasn't into her like that so it never worked out. she has a long term boyfriend now but she kept telling me how she wasn't happy sexually with him and doesn't have the heart to tell him. long story short, at the end of the night i was winning on the felt (go me) and everyone left because it was late but this girl volunteers herself to stay telling everyone else ill drive her home. i didn't clue in at the time because i was distracted by the money. anyway we get back to my truck and she grabs me and starts making out with me. one thing leads to another and we have sex in the back of my truck. she starts to feel guilty half way through and we stop right away. so i ask you reddit, did i fuck up? am i a bad guy? we were both drunk too, if that helps.\nTL;DR:"}

So I summon all the courage I can muster and just do it. She flirts laughs about it and we talk for a few seconds. She then gets up. I put my arm around her waist and pull her to me. I say i meant what i said i wasn't joking. She laughs and says \"I know.\" I then kiss her. \n\nWe do what you could call making out i guess for about 10-15 seconds. She doesnt seem to care then she slowly stops and i get the vibe i had done something wrong. I pull back ask her if i should stop she just shakes her head gets up and leaves. When i say leaves she walks into the next room where everyone is laughs and waves goodbye giving everyone hugs. I catch her alone before she leaves and tell her i am sorry if i made a mistake.

Unfortunately, what little i have had, had potential to become more abusive than the slightly annoying little things they would do (guilting, sneaking around, lying, trying to control emotions, stuff like that) so i cut it off each time after i figured out what was happening. \n\nSo FINALLY a little over a month ago, i met a really nice guy [20M], and we hung out, and decided we liked each other, and hung out some more. We progressed from hugging to kissing to sex to spending the night VERY quickly, but he wasnt rushing me, i wasnt rushing him, and if i say 'no' or 'stop' then he stops, which i havent ever witnessed with a guy before. Its a really good feeling :)\n\nI am a little bit concerned, though. Like i said, ive never had a healthy relationship before this, so i dont have an absolutely certain idea of what is normal. This is because he likes to spend literally all of our free time together. I dont have a problem with it, as i like him and we get along, and our families like each other, and all that. I guess its a little bit weird because as soon as i get off work (usually really late, like midnight or 1) he offers to pick me up, and for me to spend the night and usually the next. I appreciate it because i dont have transportation and have to ask coworkers for rides anyway. After that, i will spend a couple nights at his house. Not just sexually, we dont even have as much sex as people probably think we do, we just hang out and spend time with each other. He just suggests that we are together every moment we possibly could be. \n\nIs that a bad thing? I enjoy being with him, so im not unhappy.

We were supplied with a jumper and polo to wear as a work uniform (with the company emblem and blah blah).\n\nWhen I first started working there, I was at least 215lbs, the heaviest I'd ever been. The polo was like a vacuum on me, making me look like a sausage wrapped tightly with cling film.\n\nFast forward to today, March 17th, and it was a really warm St. Patrick's Day, so I thought 'I can't wear a jumper over this, I'll sweat like crazy!', so I went with polo only. But years of being really overweight/obese and being self-conscious of my fat being so obvious made me reluctant to ever wear just polos, t-shirts or anything that was a really thin boundary between the outside and my fat body, but I forced myself today to do it.\n\nI couldn't believe how much better-fitting this polo had become, I actually looked much thinner than I was, even though I've only lost 15lbs. I got home from work afterwards and my family, who had never seen me just wear the work polo, commented on how much slimmer I looked.\n\nTalk about a confidence boost, I had never been complimented on losing weight before, so it was a real flattering moment.\nTL;DR:"}

Long story short, we met on an online dating site that both me and my friend use.

Now that my brain is balanced, I have a naturally more positive outlook and already am finding some mental clarity and that I am getting along better with people, have found my passion in life, got promoted. \n\nHowever, my depression has left me with a lot of people from my past who seriously dislike me, and who remain in my life through one means or another. It has also left me with a crippling feeling that people do not like me, and find me boring/that I bring them down, as this typically happened to me in the past - where people would single me out to exclude me, treat me like shit, or act in ways like they were actively embarrassed to be seen with me/flat out ignore me if I tried talking to them.\n\nI am noticing that my slashed view of people, based on how I've been treated in the past, is really hurting my attitude towards people and makes me distrustful/feel like a backup towards the few people in my life who have stuck it out. It also makes me less likely to reach out to people, because I automatically assume it won't be fun for them (as has been in the past).\n\nAnyways, I know I deserve to have good things/love in my life after all I've been through, but am struggling very hard to get passed the \"you don't really like me\" thing.

As I got to know her better and spend more time doing things together with her, I started to fall in love with her not for how she looks physically, but for her characteristics and other amazing qualities. \n\n-I confessed my love to her a few weeks ago, but she told me she \"wasn't ready\" because she just got out of a long-distance relationship 3 months ago. (I knew about that but took the risk anyways since I thought 3 months was long enough for her to have a new start.) She also said there were a lot of \"uncertainties with the future\" because I am going to graduate in 3 months and will be leaving to go to Boston for graduate school while she has another year left in California. (She said she doesn't want the worries associated with a long-distance relationship again.)\n\n-I was heart-broken but I told her i have accepted the fact that we should just remain very close friends. Now we are still living together, but we constantly see each other 3-4 times a day. We also spend most of our weekends doing activities together such as cooking, shopping, philosophical talks, studying...etc...\n\n-At this rate, I feel like I will never get over her because of the fact that I have a prize in front of me that I cannot obtain. I also don't want to fade away from her life because we still have 3 months to live together. (I am also hoping that maybe she will give me a chance in the future if we are more stable with our lives and don't have these \"uncertainties\" get in the way.) I just don't know what to do right now or how not to feel what I am feeling right now. \n\n-Any help will be greatly appreciated guys! Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

It was wonderful. He's everything I could have asked for: smart, funny, handsome, purposeful. Apparently there's nothing wrong with me either... except I had planned on leaving our college town at this time, and should have been moving out west right about now. He's had a lot of trouble with long distance before, and he wanted me to follow my dream of moving out west to pursue a career goal, so he broke it off early to avoid any pain later. I was devastated, because there was literally nothing wrong, and I'd hoped that, just for once, someone would take a chance on me. But it was the idea of distance that he couldn't overcome. \n\nHe'd said he would be open to having coffee or going rock-climbing once we had some time apart, and I told him that if I contacted him it would be to ask him if he was still single. \n\nWell, six months have passed, and the job opportunity out west didn't pan out. I'm... actually not as upset about that as I thought I might be. It opened a door to staying here for another two years, getting a promotion and company-paid training at the professional level.

We were good friends for over a year before we started dating.\n\n  He is everything I could ever want in a partner -- stable, affectionate, honest, loyal and funny.  This is truly the first 'adult' relationship I've had, where I feel I can absolutely trust this man, and vice versa.   Our sex life has been getting a lot better, although it started off as not the greatest due to his confidence issues (he's a bigger guy).  We've been very open with each other, and talked about his confidence issues and weight issues, which has helped a great deal. He has also had some performance issues in bed, but these seem to be getting better as he gets more comfortable with me. He is also working out with me, which is a big help.  \n\nMy only question is ... as much as I adore being with him, and can't imagine not dating him, I have had absolutely no honeymoon phase with this guy. It's like we've already been together for years.  We're absolutely comfortable with each other. I have no fluttery nerves, butterflies, or over the moon feelings. I'm not infatuated with him, or have the feeling I need to have sex with him 3 times a day.  Don't get me wrong -- I really, really like him, enjoy his company, our sex life is getting way better and is promising to turn in to something special, and I can't imagine not dating him. I can see a future with this man. But I've never NOT had the honeymoon phase in a relationship and it has me a little concerned.\n\nShould I be worried that this is a future red flag?

We tried about half a drop of the sauce and right away for about ten minutes our tongues were on fire and my tongue was in milk the whole time. After that he almost never used it so I snuck some in a plastic cup to school because I knew the kids there would love to try them. When I arrived A few of my close friends only tried a small drop because they knew they couldn't tolerate hot sauce that much. I then, threw out the day let people try only a drop because I knew even though they said hot sauce didn't affect them they would end up crying (yes it was that hot). Then  this kid came up to me (let's call him Tom) and said that he'd try a whole finger full. I warned him but he laughed at me so I said something like be my guest. He then tried a finger full, laughed, and then after after about 10 seconds Tom ran to the bathroom and stood at the sink for the rest of lunch (I think our lunch was 45 minutes). After about half an hour at the sink we checked on him and his tongue was the redder than blood. We started to freak and at the end of lunch he was sent home, went to the hospital and wasn't there the next day (presumably dead, obviously not why would you think he died?). Anyways I kept giving out more hot sauce to more people that day. In the end two kids were sent home. One being me because I got some in my eye.\nTL;DR:"}

This is not the first time he has not replied to my email for days even after I sent a polite question about whether we was receiving emails from me or not.\n\nMy thought is that he just doesn't see me as a capable student, and to make matters worse my experiments have not been perfect this semester because I am practically using expired reagents for my research. Despite my insistence that I am getting poor results because of the expired reagents, and that we should order new ones, he has not done it. This further reassures me that he does not care for me as a student, and he is basically biding the time till I leave.\n\nIf I was to defend his actions, I would say that he's acting this way because I only joined his lab for a semester as I am graduating early. So maybe he doesn't want to invest in me because I am leaving soon. But I don't understand why he won't order new reagents when people after me will use them as well.\n\nThis really saddens me because I want to ask this person for a letter of recommendation.

We'd all go out as a group, and he'd start dancing with me and then just pull away, he'd hold my hand when we would get a drink but ignore me when he'd come for dinner parties, suddenly rub my shoulders and tell me a bunch of sweet things and compliment me on how I look and then walk away like nothing happened, slow dance to really romantic songs and then act super cold towards other male friends (who were all gay, but he didn't know). When I throw dinner parties, he's the first one to arrive and usually he ends up staying over since we're too drunk. We just sit and watch Youtube videos and talk about life. He's given me really unique birthday/holiday presents and we are going on a road trip together in two weeks - just the two of us.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: [19m] Best girl friend rejected me. [19f]\nPOST: There is a girl in my friend group at school who I developed feelings for a while ago. She told me she just liked me as a friend. Prior to that, I had only developed feelings for her because I was positive she liked me, her friend had told me she was sort of interested in me, so I went in thinking I had nothing to lose.\n\nMonths later, I am still confused and upset. We flirt constantly, and she acts different to me than to the other guys in our group. I really can't take it anymore. I love flirting with and talking to her, and even my friends who were unaware of our brief history have recently said we have some great chemistry together and that I should do something about it (how ironic). I make her laugh all the time, for minutes straight, and I feel like I am truly myself around her. Also, I have dated one other girl since then but nothing too serious, and my friend said she seemed visibly jealous by that.\n\nLike I said, I can't keep doing this. I keep deluding myself into thinking something will come of it. She gets everything from me hanging out with her in the group (humor, my personality) whereas I gain nothing but delusions. However, it's not like I can just leave her. Our group is very small and close, with only two girls, and I really like the other people in the group, and they are my close friends here (possibly why she didn't go further with me in the first place). What do I do? I will be absolutely crushed if she ever finds someone else. The only way I have gotten over this feeling in the past is by leaving the girl behind, but that's simply not possible here. \n\nBtw, she probably has no idea I still harbor feelings, aside from the flirting. I think she thinks the whole thing is in the past.\nTL;DR:"}

What's the strangest thing that's ever happened to you?\nPOST: Some time ago back in high school, I was chilling with my friend in my car having a conversation about something I don't remember.  The car was parked in a strip mall at night, in a parking space which faced directly to the sidewalk,  Along that sidewalk, at least 20 feet to the left, was a utility pole.  All of a sudden, a huge blue spark comes out of the transformer of on that poll, moves almost directly in front of my car, and flashes bright.  I didn't think anything of it, and continued with my conversation.  All of a sudden, it's time to go, so I stick the key in the ignition and start the car.  The starter makes no noise.  But what did happen is all the electronics in the car went FUCKIN NUTS.  The alarm went off, the automatic locks stopped working, all the sensor lights went on, I don't think the windows worked right, and some other effects I can't remember.  The electronics eventually calmed down (the alarm did, I can't remember what portion was fixed by the mechanic), the car never started and had to be towed, and the starter replaced.  The funny thing is, this didn't happen to any of the cars next to me, nor was any of the electricity in any stores in the strip mall effected.  Just my car.  I can't think of the ridiculously low mathematically probability of this happening to anyone.\nTL;DR:"}

Sorry to dump this much text, but I normally never feel like I need validation for what I'm doing, but I just feel like I'm at a weird point in life.\n\nTo start off, just a bit of background (you can skip this). I'm starting my third year of Human Resource Management in the fall at a local university. I partied ridiculously hard in my first year and a half (going out 3 or more times a week, tonnes of shots, slept around, etc.) and I had a lot of drinking friends during that time. When I started my second year I dated this girl for a bit then we broke up and since then I haven't really dated at all, or gone out nearly as much.\n\nNow for the recent part, I really buckled down in the last spring semester, and although I didn't do as good as I was before I'm still happy with my grades (3.7). I decided this summer to study for my LSAT because I really want to do some form of corporate/employment law. I also work about 50 hours a week at the co-op I got through the school hiring and supervising at a local factory. All in all, I work between 40-50 hours a week and study 10-20.\n\nNow what I'm wondering, is this normal? I still see my friends occasionally but a weekend usually involves going to bed early, studying, and maybe grabbing a beer or something for a bit with friends. When I look at my friends though, I see a lot of them partying, and dating. I'm not butthurt about not being able to do that right now, but I'm just wondering if you guys and girls think I'm acting in a weird way for someone my age? I still keep in decent shape as well.\nTL;DR:"}

So I break things off with Trevor, and proceed to pursue a relationship with current BF. Almost immediately after breaking up with him, he proceeds to tell me his true opinion of me and admits that he only dated me out of pity and because he thought I'd be an easy fuck (we never slept together, so joke's on him). I'm also almost entirely sure he was cheating on me, though he never confirmed that, as he was incredibly secretive. \n\nSo now I've been dating current BF and things are wonderful, except that I'm still not able to fully trust him after that last hot mess. He's so patient with me, he puts in so much effort and constantly makes me feel beautiful and tells me he loves me for who I am.

I received a letter advising of my appointment date/time/location etc. \n\nFor some reason I thought that the letter said 'X' day in July, so when it got to the beginning of July I re-checked the letter to confirm the exact date, only to find out that it said 'X' day in JUNE.\nI reach for my phone to rearrange the appointment, looking at my hand I suddenly realise that ALL the warts are gone, just like that. No idea when it happened or how long it took, but they'd disappeared and have never come back some 6 years later!\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [26/f] want to ask out Stephen [27/m], but it might be taboo? I don't know how to approach him - or if I should.\nPOST: Hi everybody. \n\nI am in graduate school in the northeast US in a program that is highly specialized, prestigious, and competitive. Each year's class is about 10 students who move through the program together. We become quite close and, although it's competitive, we really rely on each other's support to get through it successfully. There is no rule about not dating within your class, and the school and teachers could not care less, but there's kind of an unspoken rule within the culture of the program that you don't date someone in your class. Kind of a \"don't sh*t where you eat\" thing. That being said, it happens -- but I guess often when it ends, it doesn't end well. \n\nI've started to realize over the past month or two that I am really starting to fall for my classmate Stephen. We've gotten along since day one of the program and I have never felt that competitiveness with him -- just genuine support for one another. He's really someone I could see myself spending my life with - and that both scares and excites me. I honestly have no clue if he sees me that way too or not. Because of the nature of our program, I think people just assume that any romantic interest that you could interpret just isn't actually there, so you're never really looking out for that... if that makes any sense? I really don't know how to tell him how I feel, or find out how he feels, without causing some weird scene that everyone in the program finds out about. \n\nAdmittedly too, and I think this is important: most of us spend so much time pouring ourselves into our studies and into this program, that dating in general takes a backseat. For me personally, I can honestly say that even if Stephen wasn't in this program with me, I would have trouble showing that I am interested without feeling like a goofball totally forcing it... and have trouble catching the signs back. \n\nAdvice?\nTL;DR:"}

My girl of seven years who I have never cheated on could not come so I was going to enjoy my self and drink a lot with my friends.  My buddy who I have know since I was seven shows up with his girl friend (let's call her M) who has always been flirtatious with me.

I asked her what happened and she say she came into my room 5 minutes ago naked and jumped under my covers.  I must have started having sex with her not realizing who i was with.  I am still extremely intoxicated and do not remember much except saying that her boy friend is going to kill me and that my girlfriend would never forgive me (her parents divorced due to her father cheating and I promised I would never hurt her like that).  She stumbles out of the room. And I fall back asleep.  I haven't eaten in 3 days and I started crying at work today. I can't take the guilt but it's something I would have never choosen to do.

When making simple decisions (such as where to eat / what to cook, what movie to see, how to celebrate an occasion, etc.) it goes one of two ways:  We compromise and settle on something that we're both okay with (which I am *not* complaining about), or we do what he wants.  Regarding the latter, let's use his birthday for example: I let him completely decide what he wants to do, where to eat, or whatever.  \n\nEven if he chooses something I really don't like, I smile and say \"Of course!\"  Because, hey, it's his day, why not have his way?  But when it comes to my birthday or special event, he asks what I want and when I answer, he tries to change my mind.  \"Oh, but that's not very nice, why don't we go to ___ instead??\"  And then when I try to explain that I'm capable of expressing my wants and he doesn't understand what I'm saying, he wonders why I get frustrated.  \n\nIn the end, I just get mad and say \"fuck it, do as you please, it's not worth arguing over.\"  And then he appears to feel bad and tries to say sorry, and go back and say we can do what I want, but by then I'm done discussing the matter.  Why does it have to come to me becoming angry because I have to provide a thorough explanation as to why I want a certain thing?\n\nAgain, I will re-iterate, I have absolutely no problem compromising.  None.  But it gets tiring when your partner is really particular and opinionated, and can't just roll with things just *once* in a while.  Does anyone understand what I'm trying to say?\nTL;DR:"}

I know it's in the past and that she is a woman and I am not against transgendered people at all, but I just don't know, it kinda makes me feel inadequate or something.

Basically she and I are very different and in the past (middle school) I would make fun of her for it. \n\nWhen I got to high school and we had 2 years at different schools I grew out of it for the most part and since we spent our time with drastically different hobbies and social groups we had little interaction outside of home and what interaction we had I kept to be what I thought was pleasant. \n\nI'm realizing now that her insecurities, even in her senior year, are so great that she sees every single action that I take (along with anyone outside of her close friends) as directly related to her in a negative way. Confronting her directly doesn't work because she thinks that apologies and/or thoughtful discussion are actually just tricks and that everything we do is in mocking of her. I can't say that she thinks the world revolves around her without sounding like a dick brother, but that's honestly how it feels at this point. Everything I do, from talking to my little brother, to calling friends on the phone, and to the music I listen to, she takes as somehow a negative attack on her in some way. I don't know how to fix this. I can't remember the last time I was intentionally mean to her, yet I keep hearing stories from mutual friends about how I'm the \"brother from hell\" or \"worst person in the world\" etc. The things she tells her friends are entirely made up or gross exaggerations. I would love to have a good relationship with her but at this point I just have no idea what to do. Any tips?\nTL;DR:"}

There is a girl [18-19F] in my class I am interested in. She is funny, smart, hot, the whole nine yards. Way out of my league.\n\nI like to think I am intelligent, and most people think I am funny. I am not \"hot\" or attractive by any standards. \n\nIn my clique, I am the undisputed alpha. People engage in whatever activity I choose. I am always the one who suggests new activites, and people usually comply. I don't force things, nor do I bully people into submission, or anything like that. It's just how the cards fall.\n\nAnyways, over the last couple of months, I figured the attraction was one-sided, and looked towards pursuing other options. However, I couldn't get her out of my head. \n\nThe other day in class, I thought I caught her checking me out repeatedly. I would see her looking at me in the corner of my eye. As soon as I would look in her direction, she would quickly look away. This happened every couple of minutes. I would do the same thing when I was younger, so this caught my attention.\n\nAnyways, I was sitting with a group of three or four other guys, all of whom are more attractive than me; she could have been checking out any one of us. \n\nToday, I purposefully sat on the opposite side of her, away from other guys, to test my hypothesis. Much to my surprise, the same thing happened. Although, I did see her looking at the other guys occasionally, so I can't be sure.\n\nAnyways, I am 90% sure she is interested. My questions are\n\n1. Is it plausible that she is interested, or am I imagining things?\n2. Assuming she is interested, is it appropriate for me to pursue her? How might I go about it?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by opening the backdoor of my girlfriend's parent's house to let their dogs in.\nPOST: So this weekend I went to go visit my girlfriend at her parent's house. I decided to sleep on the living room couch during my stay. Last night, (3AM today to be exact), the dogs kept scratching at the backdoor. My girlfriend, her parents, her sister and her baby were all asleep and I wasn't sure if they wanted to leave the dogs out in the yard for the whole night. The weather was getting nicer so I thought it kinda made sense but they kept scratching and whining so I get up and walk to the door. I grab the handle, turn it, pull the door and I immediately regret it. All of a sudden a security alarm goes off, blasting at full volume, at 3 in the morning. I facepalmed so hard as I listened to an automated voice on a loudspeaker say \"A DOOR HAS BEEN OPENED. AN INTRUDER HAS ENTERED. THE POLICE HAVE BEEN CALLED. PLEASE LEAVE THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY!\" It's repeating that along with an alarm noise going off. I decide to walk to her parents room (also on the first floor) to try and explain the situation. Their door is ajar but all the lights are off and I'm afraid of walking in because I didn't want to be mistaken for a potential intruder. I'll never forget what happened next. Her dad rushes out, shirtless, one hand holding a blanket wrapped around his lower half with a surprised look on his face, something straight out of a comedy flick. I try to yell over the alarm that I opened a door and luckily he was able to hear me even though we were right next to the loudspeaker. He puts in the code to shut it off and calls the police to let them know it was a false alarm. The next morning I tell my girlfriend (her room is on the second floor) about it and she didn't even notice. I'm not sure about her sister and the baby (also sleeping on the second floor) but for the most part it didn't seem like that big of a deal. I'm just glad I didn't get knocked out by her father for possibly thinking I was a burglar.\nTL;DR:"}

There were a very few number of spaces available so I decide to park up and leave this diva who took up 2 spaces a note of \"disapproval\". What I wrote on the letter was \"Learn how to park you \"\"C\" word\". I then walked into my college and par-took in an exam. Upon leaving I was told I had to go with the security guard and I had to give him my ID card so I did. They then said I upset her immensely and I was seen on CCTV putting this tiny note under her wind screen wiper. \n\nI was then informed if I didn't apologize and get her approval I could be suspended or have my parking permit taken away or no action taken. If i don't apologize then i get the worse possible out come.\n\nI am a very condescending person and I deem this whole thing to be extremely over the top and if I had a small note on my car with the same words I'd just take it off and carry on. I'm not exactly sure what to do but punishing me for telling someone who is 2 times my age to park better seems a bit pathetic. I specifically used the C word because it is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock, which was the effect I desired for her to experience and because it is the second most taboo word in the English language and I used it in the meaning of \"unpleasant/ stupid person\". \n\nAlso the car owner is a 50 y/o dinner lady who works part time at a 6th form college (UK), and I'm a 19.\n\nNow we have the details out of the way, what should i do?\noption 1: say sorry like a bitch and try to mean it\noption 2: insult her and maintain my attitude that she cannot park\noption 3: don't say sorry and accept whatever punishment they can think up, possible take away my parking permit and suspend me and have it on my record.\nTL;DR:"}

She was with some of her friends and we all have mutual friends sorta socializing, good shit. And we really started hitting it off again. I got her number, told her I'd invite her out to a date. I texted, got no response. However, she came over Tues. (unannounced) with her friend who was returning a book of mine. She was looking prett cute, too. She gave a lot of signs of interest besides that too (eye contact, questions, compliments, etc.)\n\nThe thing is I guess, I've been burned by a woman playing hard to get before, and this woman happens to be somewhat of a natural flirt anyway, so I'm worried I might be misinterpreting things.

Up to this point we've had a pretty great relationship. When we first started dating we lived ~10 mins apart, then I moved 1.5 hours away for school. This past year she moved to the same city as me (~5 min apart now). There are a few things that bother me.\n\nFirst, she doesn't have very many of her own friends and she doesn't seem to make an effort to find any. As much as I love hanging out with her, I also like spending time by myself or with my own friends. I have tried telling her that I appreciate some alone time and it seemed like this offended her..\n\nNext, she is a bartender and will often work Friday/Saturday nights. The problem is that she gets upset if I go out to parties/the bars with my friends while she's working. There have been a couple times where she's gone out with friends without me, and I always encourage this (because of the reasons above), I wish she would act the same way. \n\nBoth of our current leases end in August, and she's made it very clear that she wants to get a place together. I'm not sure if I'm ready for that. We had a very serious fight last night that ended with me saying I needed some time away from her for a couple days. I love her, but right now I'm questioning if I want to stay in this relationship, let alone sign a lease together.

Time and time again this happens and it drives me crazy. First because I don't want to lose her friendship but at the same I feel that I beg too much to hang out. What would you guys do?

He says he has been somewhat thinking the same thing, but it's not enough to bother him. He thinks it's completely normal to think that way about a relationship. He tried to give an example to understand how I feel and it sums it up pretty well.\n\n\"It's like you're about to go into a country, and it's the most beautiful, perfect country in the world and you would consider staying there forever.

I have no idea why but after that I been seeing her every night in the library and we started to talk more. In a couple days after meeting her, my friends threw a small party at their apartment for the weekend and she came. We werent talking that much at first but later on that night I was just talking with my friend who went to go take a piss and told me to save his spot. As soon as my friend left, she took his spot and sat right next to me. She started some small talk with me and we just talked for a couple hours. As the night went on, she became really touchy such as laying her arm on my leg and putting her head on my shoulder. The next day, i got her number and went back to my dorm. A couple hours later, I got a text from her asking what you doing and what not. As the days went by she started to become more touchy nothing sexually and give me stare sometimes. In the few weeks, we been texting each other almost everyday saying good night. In a couple of our conversations, she says im make her laugh and happy but tells me she only likes me as a friend. Even after saying this, she still flirts and texts me first most of the time. I dont get what is going on. I have feelings for her but I'm not sure if she does as well. I dont want to get more involve just to get hurt. Please give me some advice on this situation. Should i stop talking to her? or Confront her about this?\n\nNOTES** She is generally a very shy and anti-social person but with me she just clicked right away and opened up.

Everything is going great; we love each other, we accept each other for who we are, and we're open and honest with each other. \n\n  Then there's *that* guy. You know who he is. Your girlfriend's best guy friend who you try your best not to get a little jealous around. He has had a thing for her before, and has admitted to still having feelings for her *while she was still in a relationship with me*. It makes me feel a little weird about them talking so much, but I get over it. Jealousy really isn't the issue here.\n\n   Whenever my girlfriend and I have a disagreement, or something not so great happens, she talks to him about it. I can understand that; they've been helping each other out for a while now. The problem is, he tries his damnest to make me look like a horrible boyfriend. I don't think I'm the most perfect guy in the world. I have my flaws. But whenever she goes to him about these flaws, he blows it up to make me look like the shittiest person in the world. It hurts, and I would simply brush it off as him being a dick head if it weren't for this; \n\n  Time and time again, he blatantly flirts with her. For example, he sometimes calls her sexy and talks about what it would be like if they were together. I am beginning to think that he is trying to sabatoge our relationship to get her to be with him. My girlfriend brushes it of, insisting that it's completely innocent. (she uses his bisexuality as an excuse for some reason I don't understand). \n\n  My girlfriend obviously isn't okay with him talking down about me, but that in and of itself isn't really the problem. The problem is that I think he is trying to get between us. \n\nAm I just being paranoid? If not, how should I confront this?\nTL;DR:"}

We talked about going to concerts, etc. together. And I told her when it came to something like that, I wouldn't want her to go without me. I guess I'm just uncomfortable with her getting fucked up with the possibility of guys trying to hit on her, without me there. In her eyes, this means that I don't trust her completely, though she didn't get angry, and said it didn't hurt her, but that I had nothing to worry about and that no amount of alcohol could ever lead her to messing up what we have. I thought that was incredibly sweet, and I honestly do trust her completely (in my eyes, at least), but I definitely can't hide the fact that I'd have\u00a0anxieties about her partying without me there.\n\nI do know she truly loves me, and I guess I just worry that while she says she'd never do those things, that may change when her judgement is more clouded. I do really love this girl, and she's never given me any reason not to trust her. In fact we had a very long discussion, and she told me it was okay to have these anxieties, but she doesn't believe I can completely trust her until I'm rid of those.\n\nI guess this isn't the biggest problem, and we kind of talked it out ourselves. I guess my question for those with more experience is, would you be okay with your SO getting drunk and partying without you? If not, does that mean you don't entirely trust them? And if so, how can I better come to terms with this, and not be anxious about it?\nTL;DR:"}

Its a long one, but it could just entertain you if you read the whole thing! WHO KNOWS?!\n\nAnother question for the masses. About a month and a half ago I was dumped from a six month relationship and decided to use that as an excuse to better what i thought was in need of fixing, and one of the things on the list was get back in touch with friends i have not seen in a while.\nOne of those friends was a gal i met at work several years ago and had a crush on, but moved on from it when i felt it was not reciprocated and stuck with being her friend. We became very close and i helped her through breakups and all that jazz, but never really trying to move beyond friendship and perfectly okay with that. But there were always things that got me wondering, like she kept a picture of just us next to her bed amidst a severe lack of any other pictures. But i shrugged it off.\nSo we began hanging out again after my break up after about a year of not hanging out and sporadic talking. Now we talk all the time and hang out more or less every weekend and i am being more outgoing (part of the list) so we are having more fun together. Which is nice, and then we happen to go to a bar sometimes (or some alcohol becomes involved), and since i do not drink I am always the sober one while she (and possibly whoever we are with) drinks and she never gets wasted but becomes inebriated after a while. When drunk she becomes very touchy feely and is very rarely without her arm interlocked with mine or hugging me or along those lines. Then she'll get one talking about things and a lot of the time it'll be quite complimentary of me \"i love hanging out with you, i really like your writing\" things along those lines. She also loves taking pictures with me, as in whenever my phone happens to be out she requests the camera. Truthfully this is not something i am going crazy over, i love hanging out with the gal but i am curious.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm clever and I know a lot because I loved to read and learn since I was very young, due to this I coasted comfortably through all of school without studying, sometimes completely neglecting assignments, and I never got a job even though all of my friends did at 14. I should also add in that I wish to go to law school after getting a bachelors degree in *something*.\n\nMy marks are *fine*, fine being the keyword. I've never failed a class but I only ever received honor roll once (Honor roll being an average of over 85 in all classes) and nowadays my marks sit at 67% average with my best class being a 75% and my worst being a 58%. I don't expect to be the valedictorian but I would love to have a high (85%-95%) for the next year and a half. The saying \"a lot of people want a lot of things\" definitely applies here, but I know for a fact I could do it if I could learn to study and do homework regularly, as I'm sure you know bad habits are an uphill battle.\n\nMy second issue is I have no real experience in a workplace, as I already said I have never had a job and I would but I use a constant excuse, that being where I live. See I live in a small town of about 5,000 people that's around half an hour from my High School (which is situated in a city with 140,000 people), I don't have a drivers license and I wont be able to get one until May of this year so working in the city is nearly impossible. My only options in my hometown are as follows: Fast Food, Cashier, Drug Dealer, and those all have horrible hours and are over-populated with all the other teenagers with similar job issues (not to mention one is illegal).\n\nNone of this would be a problem if I liked where I lived and was fine with going to work in the oil field, but being Liberal and wanting to shoot for the stars really doesn't work out well in the middle of a conservative good ol' boys area.\nTL;DR:"}

I was inching out slow so I could see around the foliage to see if traffic was coming. I pull out and low and behold they are turning the same way as me. This is when I decided I would exact my revenge.\n\nThis road has a speed limit of 55mph. Normally I do 60mph. That particular day I drove 45mph full well knowing it would only make me later for work.

I only sped up when a section to pass came up so they could not get around me. This continue for about 8 miles before my turn came up. You cannot imagine my glee when they put their signal on for the same turn. That road has a speed limit of 35 which I usually ignore fully and drive what I feel.

We hang out every single day for hours, and basically are a couple without the official title.

Since then we've acted pretty much the same, except for me mentioning that I could fall in love with her/marry her one day. We never discussed being exclusive.\n\nThis past week I slept with a few different girls, so I didn't have much time for my FWB. I didn't talk to her for a few days which is very unusual, and when I did I mentioned sleeping with the girls, as I've always told her about my hookups. She usually responds with some supportive answer, but this time she said she felt disgusted and was done talking for the night. She's usually very chill and not the jealous type, so it was even weirder to experience that response from her. \n\nI asked her about it the next day, and she told me what I do with other girls is fine, and doesn't bother her, but rather telling her I liked her was the problem. She acknowledged that we aren't exclusive, and said she would've been fine continuing our friendship without all the \"fake i like you stuff\". I told her I do actually like her though, and my feelings aren't fake. She said that is hard to believe.\n\nI haven't spoken to her in a couple of days, and I think she wants me to feel sorry, and I don't.

My mom has been living in the same apartment for over 30 years. This year my landlord passed away and his wife/girlfriend had to sell it. We SPECIFICALLY told the gf that we have no where to go so tell the buyers we come with the house. I've lived here my whole life.\n     Today we got the news that someone bought the house (yay!) but later, the girlfriend of my landlord says the buyers want us out by october 1st. We have no where to go. The only place we could live is in the car. We have a lower income and can only afford this place. I can't do much since I'm not 18. Kind people of reddit, what do I do?\n\n    (I live in a house that is split in two. We live in the downstairs area, and the landlord was in the upper level) the house needs MAJOR work upstairs.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: First Post - Any suggestions for helping a dog that  snaps when woken from sleep?\nPOST: Our pack includes a 3-yr old mixed breed lab/hound/(pit?) named Tails. She roams the house freely during the day and is SUPER sweet to everyone... except when you wake her up. The most extreme case was when my wife came in one morning to wake Tails up and send her outside for her morning potty break (we have a huge fenced in back yard, so we just send her out to do her business then let her back in when she's finished - no messes in the house, great dog). At any rate, the wife bent over Tails, and the dog just snapped and caught my wife on the nose. \n\nSo, after the hospital visit for stitches, some soul searching, and a decision that we would try to figure out a remedy for this reaction (either through changing our behavior or through training Tails somehow). We have had almost no success. The other night, Tails is asleep not very near me on the couch. I set the laptop down near her not thinking about it, and she snapped at me (didn't catch me). She appears remorseful after the fact, realizes there's something not right and that we're not happy alphas. What would an alpha do to stop this reaction, if anything?\n\nReally just want some advice on exercises we can safely do to help stem the aggression when Tails wakes up. We've NEVER experienced aggression from her except when she sleeps. I can remember this happening at least half a dozen times since the initial \"nose\" incident. Any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I am 27 years old, I graduated 10 years ago from high school. Lately I have been browsing my old classmates on facebook and to my dismay, a large percentage of them have went on to become fairly successful people. People who were 'like me' ended up being Managers and Senior this, Executive that. Going on extravagant vacations I couldn't take if I saved for years. \n\nSo it got me to thinking, I want to be successful. Most peoples first response is to ask about college...I went 2 separate semesters, and, admittedly failed most classes in both. Its tough to go to college and not actually have a goal. I just cant get into General Studies without knowing there is something afterwards. I would love to do something in tech, but there is so much out there it is daunting. I could learn a programming language, but which one? Whats the difference? How much do I need to know to get a job? None of it makes any sense to me, Like when I have tried to learn programming in the past, Its teaching me \"the basics\" but the basics never seem to lead into anything substantial? I can't believe some mega corporation will want to hire me to program a 'neat-o quiz thingy'. \n\nAdmittedly I live in Indiana and not near Indianapolis so there aren't many big opportunities here, but Id be willing to move if I thought I had a shot at something. Id settle for being a manager of something, but every job I ever worked doesn't seem to work the way it does on tv. Ive been working since 16 at various places and never had an opportunity to advance. It was always outsiders brought in who already had the experience, or people who had worked there 10 years or so. Im not getting any younger and I just feel overwhelmed. \n\nSorry about the wall of text.\nTL;DR:"}

In the midst of obtuse drug legislation, people are turning from weed -- a plant people have been smoking for thousands of years -- to these new \"herbal\" spice blends that contain JWH-018 and other synthetic analogues. Nobody knows the long-term implications of these drugs, what happens as a result of full CB1 agonist activity, or if they are potential carcinogens.\n\nI've also noticed an upsurge of \"4Loko,\" and \"Joose,\" which are two alcohol-containing energy drinks that people have died from. Not only are you ingesting two dehydrating chemicals, but you're mixing a stimulant with a depressant. Yeah yeah, I know that this is done anyway when people order these complementary-ingredient drinks (ie. red bull/vodka) at the bar, but the real problem with these energy drinks is that kids are drinking them too quickly. The taste of alcohol is almost nonexistent, so down the hatch they go. This is frequently done by kids who do not yet possess any real concept of how their own body metabolizes alcohol.\n\nI don't mean to sound like a mom here. Obviously, cigarettes, cigars, and other types of alcohol are still legal. I'm just concerned and wondering what's caused a shift from the \"classic\" experimental materials to these new-fangled and potentially (more) dangerous substances.\nTL;DR:"}

My fiance and I have been in a 4 year legal battle for custody of my two older children. Their mother wants to eventually leave town with them and obviously I won't allow that. Right now we have every second weekend and a Wednesday visitation with my kids. \n\nMy ex recently asked if my daughter could attend a birthday party on one of the weekends we have access. Rather than say no outright I tend to take the requests into consideration because I feel my kids shouldn't miss things like birthday parties with their friends. In this specific case the birthday is of my exes friends kid (who is also an ex of mine :S ). The birthday falls during the same time we have a birthday party with one of our friends kids and would be a huge inconvenience and rude to leave one birthday to bring my daughter to another. I told my ex this, and she of course tells my daughter. My daughter then calls me and asks me to go..telling me its not fair she can't go. I told her that I told her mom why already, and I reiterated. I did however tell her I would consider it again and let her know.\n\nWhen I told my fiance she completely flipped out saying I always go back on what we decide when it comes to the ex and that my kids always get their way.

I'm very sexually active and excitable person and he claims to be too, but he rejects 99% of my initiations to have sex with him and it's destroying my self-confidence. He tells me I'm attractive and holds physical contact such as cuddles and kisses, but becomes distant and irritated when I initiate sex. I don't feel sexually wanted by him and I feel like he is disgusted by my attempts to \"seduce\" or be sexually desirable. He has mentioned low mood and possible connection to libido, which I understand, but he hasn't seeked help despite of my advice and doesn't want to talk about it. I feel extremely frustrated and start to think that's just an excuse..\n\nI really don't know what to do and my self-confidence is falling apart day by day because of this.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [25/F] with my BF [27/M] 1.5 yr, should I always have to ask for an apology?\nPOST: Hi all, \n\nI have a pretty good relationship with my boyfriend for the most part. However, he can occasionally say some things that are really hurtful, especially if he is drunk. (I feel that if he better managed his drinking, our relationship would be about 1000x better. But that's a thought for another thread.) \n\nI'm more upset about what happens after the fact. The next morning or whatever he always wants to pretend that things didn't happen. It's not that he doesn't remember because he always does. What normally happens is that I'm obviously upset. I will wait for him to bring it up or for an apology, stew for a bit, eventually bring up what happened and why it bothered me, and ask for an apology. He basically says, \"Sorry,\" and that's about it. Topic change and I am left trying to get over what was said. \n\nWhat bothers me about this is that he'll know he said something hurtful, know that I am hurt by it, and still not take responsibility for it until I put him into a position where it's practically required. At that point, it feels like he's not sorry, he's just trying to cover it and move on. \n\nIn contrast, if I say something to him that may even possibly be hurtful, I usually apologize and correct myself before he has time to even process what I have said. I am really thoughtful about how the things I say may affect him, and I am constantly checking in with him on how he's feeling. A lot of times I apologize for things that he isn't even bothered by, just because I worry that I have hurt him. \n\nI know that it's silly to expect him to read my mind and know I'm upset and apologize, but I don't think that's what's going on here. I think that he knows he is wrong and knows I am upset but would prefer to ignore it in hopes that it would go away. Should I really always have to ask for an apology to get acknowledgement of his poor behavior, or is it normal to expect someone to be empathetic and apologetic without being directly asked?\nTL;DR:"}

I met her in a math class last year and she ended up also being in my Spanish class. We ended up taking a bit, not much, and she eventually gave me her number so I could text her a school thing I had.\n\nWe texted a bit, mostly about school at the beginning, but eventually towards the end of last school year, we started talking a bit about what happened during the day, a little more personal.\n\nWe didn't talk at all during the summer, that was just it. But I knew I really liked her, for her personality, her warmness, her intelligence, everything. This isn't just about looks. \n\nCome this year, we started off they year a little distant, but she ended up sitting right next to me in another class(seating chart). We reminisced about last year, how much fun we had. We got back to where we left of essentially. \n\nNow where a few weeks into school, she starts to get more playful, for example, scaring/jumping on me, then talking about her friends, whats going on, how shes feeling, etc. \n\nShe has been one of my best friends, especially this year, and I think she feels kind of the same, as I don't see her with guys at all. \n\nHere's the thing, I want to ask her out to the mall or something, but my fear is the she rejects me. But the fear isn't of the actual rejection, it's the fact that if she rejects me, our friendship will not be the same, and its something I value a lot. \n\nShould I take the chance? Should I just let our friendship be?\nTL;DR:"}

When we got together I knew she had a drinking problem. She figured it out early in her life and has been sober for 4 years. When it comes to our relationship we were both happy, things were good and all that.\n\n**The current situation:** Three weeks ago she went to her coworker's party, fell off the wagon and cheated on me with some guy. She came home the next morning, told me, was remorseful and all that. She spent a day talking to me and figuring things out then went to rehab for a week. I haven't taken a hard stance on whether to end it with her or not, but she is very remorseful, taking the initiative on rebuilding trust and working on self improvement. So I'm leaning towards giving it a shot, and if this is something I can't work through then it'll be over.\n\n**The problem at hand:** So, some things are reasonable to ask of your partner after infidelity (no contact with the other person, open social media etc.) and some things are not reasonable (corporal punishment, never leaving the house etc.). My gf had plans to go to a music festival out of the country with her friends this summer (late july) and has already booked and paid for plane and concert tickets. I don't feel comfortable with her going. I have not brought this up with her yet.\n\nMy question is, is it a reasonable thing to ask for her not to go? Especially considering that I may very well still break up with her over the infidelity at a later date if we can not work through it.\nTL;DR:"}

I respected that but what I totally didn't expect was his she acted the next time we saw each other (in the cafeteria). She walked right passed me and completely avoided my gaze, as if I didn't exist. The same thing happened for our final two classes, even though I sit next to her in one of them. The next day, the final day of school, same thing. I didn't want to set her off, so instead of speaking to her directly I got one of my buddies to ask her if she was willing to talk to me about the day before (I still valued the friendship we had before this whole thing). Apparently, the second my name came up she shushed my friend. And so the day went on and I still was a ghost to her. It was almost like a superpower, how well she was able to pretend I didn't exist. Zero acknowledgment of me. We have no way of communicating over the summer- she's fairly sheltered by her parents, no FB and they read her texts.

I was on a NSFW subreddit recently and found a pic of someone I know from college.

Based off of the user's history, I do not believe it was her posting her own picture.  \n\nIs this something I should bring up to her?  Is there a way to do it without embarrassing her?  What if she is aware of the post, and is more embarrassed by the fact that someone she knows saw it than by the fact that it was put up in the first place?  What's the best way to have this conversation? And if the picture was taken from her facebook, it's already public - to what extent would this bother her? Should I try and get it taken down before I even tell her?\n\nBonus topic - obviously, my first priority is to save her any embarrassment.  However, if there's a way to broach the subject that doesn't start with \"So I was looking at some dirty pictures on the internet and...\", that would be preferable. I know, I know, it's not unusual in this day and age, but still.\n\nOh, side note - we're both of Indian descent, and it was a subreddit dedicated to Indian girls.  I don't think that actually makes any difference to anything. She's definitely attractive. Again, probably irrelevant.\nTL;DR:"}

I can't come to change my relationship status on Facebook because everyone will start asking me what happened especially since we were the couple everyone was \"rooting\" for. Telling my family has been hard enough because everyone will just start off their sentences with \"Where's your other half?\" Or \"Where the giant bean stock?\" Its also important to note that he was my first everything. I lost my virginity to this boy, and also my first kiss, my first \"boyfriend\".\n\nPlease Reddit, help me. I feel like I'm about to go through one of the darkest times in my life.\nTL;DR:"}

I graduate, go to college, don't really speak to them for two years (terrible I know, and my excuse of 'I do a lot of stuff' doesn't feel like a good enough reason). Anyway, flash forward to now. I felt bad so I started talking to them, seeing how life is going. The youngest of my 'sisters' told me, 'You are the only boy I could ever date, but I know you aren't interested in a girl three years younger than you'. The older is going to my college, and well frankly I'm kind of interested in her. But I don't know whether it is the 'older brother' mentality I have, or something else. This may be because I'm a little hung up on this one other girl who is taken. Yes, well aware that I should give up, and I have. I just have awesome conversations with her. So what should I do? I really don't want to break the heart of the youngest (I worked hard to keep her happy in high school and she is awesome), but its getting to the point where I am just sick and tired of being alone.\nTL;DR:"}

But his extramarital sex makes me feel SO uncomfortable.\nPOST: A bit of background. We've been together for 3.5 wonderful years. I love him dearly and for so long it seemed nothing he could do would make me unhappy. Until now.\nAt the beginning, we mutually agreed (no coercion or compromise) that an open relationship would be ideal with us, and we'd disclose everything to one another. In that time I've slept with about 6 different people and he's kissed and fooled around with 2. That was all fine with me, until recently he met a girl on a dating site, and started having sex with her.\nI knew that extramarital sex would be the inevitable and I thought I would be okay with it. He always seemed at ease when I told him about what I'd done outside of our relationship, but I can't seem to feel the same way. When he's with her, I feel sick. He has spent the night once or twice and I laid awake all night shaking, crying, and being unable to sleep, thinking of all the things he was doing with her. I have (gently) discussed with him that I feel awful about him doing it, but I'm not interested in changing the terms of our romantic agreement.\nI should add, his sexual interactions with the other girl are rare-ish (once every 1-2 weeks) and he almost always comes home to me. I have no doubt that he loves and wants to be with me. But it still makes me feel so insecure and so awful and I can't seem to change my obsessive thoughts about it. It's at the point where our relationship is suffering because when he touches me I just want to cry.\nI honestly do think an open relationship is ideal and I'd never agree to monogamy (I'm 90% sure I'd end up cheating). What do I do about all these feelings? Does anyone else have experience on this subject?\nTL;DR:"}

He went balistic and said she has to pay him rent, car insurance (they aren't actually paying car insurance for her anyway), and said that I'm no longer invited to their house. I've always had an amicable relationship with the man, I've never had a confrontation but when he's been an asshole he usually says \"sorry you're caught up in this\" and he has seemed sincere. I have no idea what to do, whenever these things happen my gf adamantly refuses to let me get involved but I hate feeling so helpless. Any advice??\nTL;DR:"}

Should I keep trying to tough it out or will he be happier elsewhere?\nPOST: Just hoping to get some advice from strangers on the internet because I can't make a decision about this.\n\nMy cat whom I've had and loved for the past 3+ years will throw a tantrum every few months. He will throw up on his bed and then wait for me to clean the cover and put it back on before immediately throwing up on it again. He's at a very good weight and I rarely change his food type or amount. He also urinates on everything I love during these times.\n\nIt's been okay before this year because the pleasure of owning my cat has made it worthwhile although I've never discovered the reason for his tantrums (I've been to the vet so many times over this. They always check him for a uninary infection, find nothing, and send me on my way with a big bill).\n\nThis year however, my college classes have been getting really difficult and I've had some pretty significant health problems. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here. Plus I'm trying to move across the country next year and I know the trip will be traumatic for him.\n\nI don't know any of my friends or family who would want to take him, plus I wouldn't want to make him a burden to someone else. I can't justifiy giving him to a shelter to be adopted by someone I don't know or spend the rest of his life in a cage.\n\nAny advice?\nTL;DR:"}

We went our separate ways, and eventually came back together after both of our relationships failed. We've now been dating for 1.5 years, and I'm having a few issues. He's so far away, currently. He moved away for a job, and we've been fighting to move back in together. So now that move in is imminent (October 1st), we're having problems. \n\nHe sent me a few pictures today, but didn't want to talk on the phone tonight, didn't want to skype and play minecraft like normal. Well, it was ok, until I noticed he was covering his right shoulder in two of the pictures. In the last picture, I saw a red crescent moon mark on his shoulder area. When I asked what it was, and told him it looked like a hickey, he got defensive, he got angry, and he said \"ARE YOU THAT FUCKING DENSE?! It's a rash because YOU are STRESSING ME OUT.\" And that hurt, a lot. Not just because he insulted my intelligence, but because he got defensive and angry. He got mad because I don't trust him, because I'm jumping to conclusions. So we started fighting and haven't stopped since.\n\nThis to me in a game changer. I feel like if he's being so aggressive, no matter how long I've spent with him, it's a big red flag. I love this man, and I honestly believe that we're very likely to be wed, this just threw me for an emotional loop that i wasn't prepared for. I feel like I still want to move in with him, but some of the things he said like \"stay out of my life for good\" and \"fuck off\" just make me want to stop and get some advice before I proceed.\nTL;DR:"}

Teacher with a vendetta is trying to get me banned from my school!\nPOST: My name is Damien, and my school is a catholic school that taught religious education as a compulsory subject that students were forced to take throughout the year. As a hardline atheist, this disgusted me, and I wanted an outlet with which to give students a choice and show them the alternative to being brainwashed into religion.\n\nFirst I tried the debate club, but soon realized this isn't what I was looking for. They only spent a few sessions if that on REAL issues - i.e. \"Is there a God?\", \"Should religious education be a compulsory subject\", \"Is evolution compatible with religion?\" etc and spent the VAST majority of the sessions on stupid shit.\n\nSo, I decided to form my own group. I called it the Enlightenment Society, and it grew pretty popular, ending up with around 15 regular members, with more coming all the time, and spanning through all the years (\"grades\" for your Americans) all the way down to the youngest students! We'd spend time talking about Atheism vs Christianity, poking holes in the \"logic\" of Christianity, talking about the works of great scientists, encouraging and fostering intellectual thought and making posters and leaflets that we'd hand out etc.\n\nSo anyway, I had my final exams and graduated, but of course that didn't mean the end of the Enlightenment Society! I was the leader and couldn't let it dissolve, so obviously on most days I've kept going back at lunchtimes to keep the society going, bring in new members etc. Teachers have started asking me what I'm doing still on campus, and now I've been threatened and told I'm TRESPASSING and not to come on the school grounds anymore!!! They won't even listen about the Society!! It's clear to me they're worried about what I'm doing. Hmm, a catholic school doesn't like a club that promotes atheism? I wonder why!! It's clear they're trying to suppress my free speech, so what action can I take to fight back? Do I have any legal recourse! Help MUCH appreciated!!\nTL;DR:"}

Since moving in, our circumstances have dramatically changed, meaning we had a baby (who's now 15 months old), I got a decent job in my field making $50k per year, and we started a business that earns us about $2-3k extra each month.

I contribute 6% (with equal company match) to my 401k. We've been paying off debt, so we only have a couple grand available for emergencies.\n\nSo, to summarize, our monthly net income is about $5k in a slow month. Could be $6-7 in a really good one (depending on sales).\n\nBUT, there is a problem. My credit score, due to a combination of maxing out credit cards a few times (with no missed payments though), and my parents \"forgetting\" to pay my student loans for two months, is at a measly 580. Is this viable for a FHA loan, or another type of housing loan? We need more space because of our child and business, but renting just seems like a huge waste.\n\nI know I need to save for a down payment in the coming months and pay off my credit cards, but after that, what should I do?

I've had plenty of crushes, have acted on them, and have been turned down or used emotionally (I was very naive at the start of university). Now, this isn't going to be some pity-party. That'd be silly. But I must admit that the prospect of relationships is kind of drifting out of my head as a possibility. To me this seems perfectly logical - if the only thing I've experienced has been, at most, girls who really can't decide whether they like me 'in that way' or not, then why would I see things any other way?\n\nBut here's the kicker. I know plenty of people drift quite seamlessly into relationships, even if these opportunities are rare. I know they're quite simple and straightforward, but my past experiences have left me quite jaded and cynical to the possibility of this being true. \n\nI'm not a virgin, and have had a couple of flings earlier in university. When I lost my virginity, it was enjoyable (in a 'finally!' kind of way), but ultimately embarrassing (including her telling me I'm 'weird', then sort of kicking me out of her flat (have no idea what I did wrong...)); and I guess I kind of have a negative experience. The second fling was a bit messed up too (was with a long-time friend), but far more enjoyable/awesome - only her being 'on the fence' made everything really awkward after the fact. \n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is, I have yet to actually have any kind of decent, 'normal', genuinely nice sexual relationship. Coupled with some memories I'd rather forget, I am left probably worse off than having no experience at all. \n\nI'm sure all of this doubt will kinda vanish once I'm actually *there*, *in* a relationship and I get to find out what the fuss is all about, but naturally, the process of getting there (e.g. meeting new people, and so on) is made harder by a really rocky start to relationships.\nTL;DR:"}

I struggled to place her name for a second but when I remembered who she was my heart just fell right into the pit of my stomach. \n\nSince then I've been feeling really depressed and really lonely. My overall mood is much darker and I cry a lot easier. How do I deal with these feeling and my crush on Conner?\nTL;DR:"}

I have graduated an am out of school as a successful engineer. We met on tinder 3 years ago and have been doing great since. She is pre-med and will be going to Med school next fall.  She has hinted more than once about wanting more than just a relationship and that if i wasnt interested that i shouldnt waste her time. each time i have said that i am interested in more but that our situations right now arent conducive to a bigger commitment.  She is still in school 2 hours from me currently and that will likely to remain for the duration of med school at best. At worst she could be in another state during residency. I am conflicted because we could get engaged just for her to move 12 hours away for 3 years.  I am not in a place to move as i have a great job and my family is from the area. I do not know if i should have blind faith in our future but i dont have a lot of confidence that any relationship would survive years of med school and 3 years of residency of a SO working 100 hours a week 12 hrs from their SO. To cap it all off i have a deep fear that my belief of her being the best person for me is only because of my limited long term relationships.\nTL;DR:"}

We met at a school function, started hanging out, which turned into dating/relationship, etc. We fight occasionally, like any couple, but have a generally healthy relationship. On one hand, I do attribute some of the ease with which Matt and I handle topics like boundaries, family, and arguments to Matt reading and learning from other's issues on this forum. \nOn the other hand, I sometimes feel like I'm interacting with a relationship robot. I think he's gotten a lot of dating confidence from what he reads here about other's experience, but to me it's just that. *Other's* experience. I read this sub as well. I think it's a fun read and people really give great advice. However, sometimes I feel like he takes a hard stance on conflicts because he will read something here (and I get that impression because he will express sentiments or even use phrases I've read here on certain threads). I can understanding using this sub as a way to develop your ideals on relationships BUT... many of the questions here are specific and give many details about the submitter's particular history/relationship that don't apply to us. I feel like he's reading the advice here and applying big blanket statements without considering OUR history and circumstance. At best I don't feel heard, at worst I sometimes feel like he is ready to throw the relationship away because he's read some commenter's harsh criticism about a situation that may partially apply to us. \nI have brought up that I feel like he takes the advice here more seriously than how he may actually be *feeling* about a situation. He acknowledges that it has an influence but insists his stand is his own opinion/conclusion. Ultimately, I'm tired of being up against a world of criticisms about our relationship that don't even typically apply to us. \nI guess I'm looking for some advice on how to talk to him about this. Or if this is a red flag that is worth ending things over (maybe he's not really ready for a relationship).\nTL;DR:"}

I was an RA and was held to a pretty high standard of what I could and could not do on campus. I was also in theater and hung out with actors and stage techs. So, one of our friends, a hilarious Japanese international student, had graduated and was going back to Japan. We decided to have a little party, 7 total, nothing big. A few were underage, very against the rules, but were all capable of handling their liquor and were my close friends. We decide to watch a movie. The remote does not work. They play that little nose game to see who has to get up and press play on the dvd player. I say \"fuck it, it's two feet away, I'll do it.\" I get up. I press the button. I am electrocuted. My entire right side feels like it's on fire. My hair stands up. I fall to the ground and say \"Arg.\" Apparently, there was a water leak a floor above and the water went right to the outlet behind the TV. I survive, but I'm a little shaken and twitchy now, no biggie. We laugh it off. The RA on duty (this was not my building) and the RD of the building are going around knocking on all the doors to find where the water was leaking to. We get caught with alcohol out. We accept our write-ups, I get pulled aside and told by the RD that I will probably get a worse punishment. I say \"Whatever, I did it, do what you gotta do.\" Later on, I resign being an RA rather than be forced to be on academic probation and have to take alcohol counseling. Still a great night. We said 'sayonara' in a fun way, I got to know our friend electricity a little better and I spent time with people I love. \n\nSo, reddit, what days for you should have sucked, but you had a good time anyway?\nTL;DR:"}

Despite having annoying health problems (suffering to this day) I aced the final exams and scored in top 1% in every subject. I applied to the best class available in my city, choosing other schools rather randomly. The timing of internal tests to this class was rather inconvenient (severe allergies), and I got rejected, losing 1 point from 600 pool to the next person that was accepted. I tried to reapply days after rejection. I was told I was second person to be reconsidered in case of open space. In meantime I got into supposedly second best school available. It turned out the school I now go to is a nightmare. In my class and profile (I am told that other profiles are taken care of much better) there are periods when I won't be taught a subject for months due to school's incapacity to present substitutes or just to manage lessons at all. There are many distractions if we get to learn at all, and we are tremendously behind in our main subject, basically rendering me and everyone else incapable of recalling any material past junior. In-school environment (building, peers and so on) is terrible and definitely not good for anyone, plus there is an enormous religious and school's pride pressure. I've tried to reapply year later to the class, scored in top 15 at internal tests, was rejected again. Now my grades are terrible, I am extremely stressed every day, even during holidays, and there is a huge pression from my family to perform at top level again. I am sure that with my current knowledge I am not to perform well at finals. I think that with my grades low now, I've lost my carte blanche when it comes to picking another school I might want to be in. I am lost and mad at myself for screwing my choices and later not finding enough strength to fix them soon enough, rendering me in this poor spot.\nTL;DR:"}

While things were rocky between them, another girl was giving him attention and coming onto him. Eventually he broke up with his girlfriend and slept with the other girl. He then went back to his ex girlfriend.\n\nI think the issue I have is I am afraid of history repeating itself; I begin to wonder what he'll do if we come to a rocky point in the relationship.

My philosophy so far has been: if you're not hungry you don't need to eat. I've been home cooking about 90% of my meals and they're usually something along the lines of 4oz of fish or chicken, lots of green vegetables. Some days I add a second portion of meat to my meals depending on how I'm feeling.

In my eyes, she is the perfect girlfriend. I don't want anyone else. I have been completely faithful to this woman for the entire time we were were together.

Now I'm all for accepting that people make mistakes while drinking (been there done that), but when I asked her about it, she blatantly lied about it to me and led me to believe it never happened. I'm pretty clever and I figured out the actual truth relatively easily. I told her that I was mad about the kissing but I was more pissed about her lying to me. I told her that I didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who could lie so easily so i ended it and stopped talking to her.\n\nI hadn't talked to her in 4 months, and she texts me out of the blue, bringing back tons of feelings that I had since pushed away.

Well anyways, my nose was itching heavily in the seat and I just needed to pick it. Secretly, I tilted my head to the side and ended up landing on a monster booger. As im plucking it out, I turn right and see my dentist with a smile and a hand held out toward me for a handshake as I hesitantly look over in the process of pulling a booger out. I quickly said \"Wow im so sorry I didnt hear anyone walking behind me\" as im holding this booger in my right hand. I went to the bathroom and \"cleaned up\" but man was I embarrassed. Im not a very anxious person per say but I wasnt eager to walk back to that chair.\n\nIts safe to say he didnt rub it in through the tooth check; the handshake never happened though and I feel that was mutual.\nTL;DR:"}

I can talk to people pretty well I'd say, I make friends very easily and I think I'm a decent human being but nothing has ever worked out for me. In the last few weeks I started a new job at a indoor mini-golf course, I was hired with 5 other girls and I am the only male who works there. Like I said before, I made friends with everyone there pretty fast, they are all great people but I mostly have been gravitating towards one girl who is just one of the sweetest people I have ever met (in my short years of living). I relate to her so much, she like movies, science and just everything that makes me. I have been getting lunch/dinner with her, pretty much every time we get off our shift. Like today we got out at 1 or so and we decided to go to Chipotle, which dear god my butt hole is regretting, but we ended up being in this Chipotle for 2 hours just talking. After that we went and got ice cream and just sat and talked for another good hour. Ever since I got home, I have been texting her on and off but I just want to keep talking to her. The last few days I just can't stop thinking about her and it's driving me insane. I'll go to bed earlier just so I can wake up and go to work to see her. I can't concentrate on projects or anything and the time in between seeing her just seems to take an eternity and I can't handle it anymore. I'm to big of wimp to make a move and I don't want to come off as creepy. I just have never been in a situation like this. Anyways thanks for letting me just type that out and get it out of my system.\nTL;DR:"}

She was awesome to hang out with and we got along great, and we ended up talking on Skype while playing games pretty much every day.\n\nAs we got to know each other better, we realized that we have a lot in common outside of sharing a love for video games. We both love football to a fault, we watch the same TV shows/anime, and we have the same sense of humor. Once we realized that we just started to talk more often, and not just when we play games. We talk every Sunday for probably 12 hours, and we still Skype every day but it's not limited to video games.\n\nI guess in August or so I started really having feelings for her, and she seems to reciprocate those feelings. I'm not very good at this kind of thing so I could be wrong, but she's typically the one who calls me, or asks me if I want to play a game or anything like that, she shares a lot of personal stuff with me, and she's said before we need to meet up and go play paintball or go to the beach some day.\n\nI think a relationship could happen and work out, she only lives about six hours away, and like I said she's said before she wants to meet. My issue is the age difference, I mean three years isn't that much of a difference normally, but does that translate to meeting someone online? I also don't want to ruin our friendship by taking things too far and making things weird. I'd just like some sort of help with figuring out what I should do or can do in this situation, thanks in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

What seems to be the issue is since she had my half-brother [2m] she has become quite strict with what he is allowed to eat.  He does not have any allergies but cannot eat anything containing gluten, cow based dairy options (cheeses, yogurt, milk etc), sugar, certain foods must be organic (such as apples) others are allowed if not organic (bananas) the list goes on and on.  It's hard to keep track.  These same rules do not apply to herself or my father or any guests.  I have been a guest at their house many times and the adults enjoy an average diet.\n\nI do not live along the same strict guidelines.  I eat an average diet and limit processed and junk foods as best I can. I will be living close to them next year and hope to spend more time with my half-brother but I struggle with his food limitations.  If my half-brother had legitimate allergies I would not hesitate to follow dietary restrictions to the letter.  \n\nMy question is how should I handle this situation?

When I began the tour it quickly became evident that these 14 year olds did not want to be there and were not going to listen to a 5'1\" tour guide. Throughout the tour I began to stand on taller objects, such as planters and benches, to establish dominance over the youth as I gave them my tour spiel.

We remained FWB for 3 months after that, and it was too much for me to handle so i decided to go No Contact.  It has been around 2 months of that.  She respected my decision and despite the occasional (1-2 time) slip ups(her doings, not me)  its been pretty good.  By slip up i mean nothing sexual, just talk for a little.   We keep it real friendly at the work place.  Simple Hi, hows it going if we happen to be around eachother, which i avoid when i can.\n\nI miss her like crazy and I really want to talk to her - break my No Contact...  Do i want her back? Very much so.  Will it work out? I dont know, but I would try my damn best to make it so, to give us a future together and work through all the societal and familial bullshit.\n\n(to those asking why our future together would be rocky - religious differences, and family location)\n\nI just really dont know what to do at this point. Do i break NC and try to fight for this?  Do I stay the course and continue NC?  Any help, advice, suggestions would be fantastic.\nTL;DR:"}

Chillin with some good friends from junior high having just graduated high school, went to watch movie Spy at local neighborhood theater. One closer friend, lets call her Linda, gave me a card in a fairly large envelope. It didnt fit in my jacket pocket and I told her to hold onto it until after the movie, but she refused and said it was mine, so heres where i fuck up. I didnt want to fold it and kinda let it slot into a corner of my inner jacket pocket which would normally hold my phone, and i didnt zip up my jacket. Movie finishes, i walk out with friends, sit down to wait for Linda to use restroom, leave and chill at my place. I go to my younger brother's graduation, get home only to get a text from Linda asking if i had lost the letter. And thats when it hit me: that it had probably slipped after leaving the movie theater. She says there was $100 and a hefty paragraph. Now i feel terrible for literally wasting someone's time AND money.\nTL;DR:"}

My wife and I bought a ragdoll kitten from a registered breeder on Dec 18, 2013. We've had her for 3 weeks now and her \"cold\" symptoms have not seemed to improve. Here is some relevant information:\n- As soon as we got her, her eyes were a tad irritated and quite a lot of sneezing, got a vet appointment the next morning - received antibiotic ointment and 2nd round of booster shots were postponed.\n- All visible symptoms after 10 days vanished, however, sneezing persisted.\n- Right before new years, sneezing was much more frequent. Regardless, vet proceeded with 2nd round of booster shots. \n- Shortly after new years and until present time, A LOT of sneezing (~30 times a day) and visible yellow discharge from both eyes and nose. The discharge appears to irritate the eyes a tad much like in humans, I use a cotton ball dipped in warm water to rub away some of this discharge.\n- We live in a new condo building, but the ventilation system tends to shoot a lot of dust out.\n\nWe are not overly concerned about this as the symptoms are, in our eyes, not severe (ie. she is not lethargic, eats well, pees in the right spot, and is incredibly playful). However, these \"cold\" symptoms have persisted for nearly 3 weeks. My hypothesis is that she was initially fighting a respiratory infection and the 2nd round of booster shot perhaps negatively impacted her immune system causing the sickness to return.\nTL;DR:"}

But today I had a nagging feeling at work that there was something about him I needed to know, so I did some digging, found his wedding registry from last fall, looked up his wife, sure enough, they got married and as far as I can tell are *still* happily married.\n\nI'm disgusted with him, and already sent him a message saying I found out he's married, I think he's disgusting, and I don't want to continue seeing him. But if I had a husband who was fooling around on me, or even trying to fool around on me, I'd want to know. So should I try to get in contact with his wife and let her know?\n\nIf I do, it won't be until he goes home. Doesn't make sense to tell her when he's still here, and she's home alone with this thing weighing on her for a week.

Whenever it happens we deal with it and strive to make it work, but it seems that we never manage to do so, and it seems that the gap between our stages in life is just getting bigger and bigger, I feel that even if I keep trying we will never close the gap and the relationship is anyways doomed.\n\nSo, I guess that is a great concern for me, how important is to have aligned views on life and pathway when in a relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

Therefore, I enjoy cooking, baking, sewing, and a slew of other activities that many people are quick to label \"feminine\" activities.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by teaching my son to play \"kick the can\"\nPOST: So last weekend my wife and I decide to do a little bit of Christmas shopping. Personally I think it's a little too early but with 2 small children (my son is 2 and my daughter 6 months) if we don't go early it won't get done. Well after 5 hours at our local mall we end up on the opposite side of where  the car is. I decided I was going to be nice and go retrieve the car and took my son with me since he likes to be my shadow. Since the mall is sort of 'V' shaped we decided to cut through the parking lot. Since it was late there weren't many cars but a ton of trash. Directly in front of me not very long after hitting the parking lot I see a Diet Coke can sitting upright just begging to be kicked. So I kick the can and it goes bouncing across the parking lot. Seeing that the can was well smashed I was content and thought nothing more about the can. That is until there was an empty starbucks cup in front of us slightly to the left and my son pulls me towards it. He proceeds to wind back and delivers an impressive kick for a 2 year old. I tell him good job and we continue to kick cups and cans as we make our trek. A nice father son moment right? Well that leads us to last night...\n\nWe again ended up at the mall as a family outing. My wife went to get food again as I took my son to go find a seat in the food court. Now I should say it was a lot busier yesterday and in my search for a table I didn't notice the woman bending down to tie her shoe had placed her can of soda down next to her. My son did however and proceeded to kick her half full can of soda over...and all over her. Luckily she was also a mom and was super cool about it but I felt so bad.\nTL;DR:"}

I'll be honest, I've been a pretty terrible boyfriend. It started out very well, she was my first relationship ever (I wasn't hers) and I generally really felt attracted to her. Then it just sort of fell apart for me at some point and I cheated on her multiple times. I think the first time I did it we had been dating for about a year and then after that I did it almost routinely throughout our relationship with different women - sometimes club hookups, sometimes random girls I met etc.\n\nNow one of my \"friends\" said he's tired of seeing this happen and that I need to break up with her, or he'll tell her everything. I agreed that this is just pointless at this point, so I decied I should break up with her. Problem is - I've never had a girlfriend before her, I don't know how to do this stuff.\n\nBasically I'm conflicted as to how to go about doing all of this. She finishes work in a few hours and I'm not sure if I should message her, call her, go to her place, take her out somewhere public, how should I say it? While breaking up with her, should I tell her that I cheated on her? We have a lot of mutual friends so I'm kind of scared that they'll say something to her about it later, but at the same time if I'm breaking up with her eitherway I don't see what's the point of bringing the cheating up, because I feel it would make her feel worse. Also - our relationship, at least from her perspective, is pretty much perfect so I don't know how I should break up with her. I don't know how to do this or what to say. \n\nPlease help.\nTL;DR:"}

He's super busy, which is awesome; he's involved in so many great things. Because of this, I feel like I don't see him one on one too much. The past two times we've tried to go on dates, something came up. I feel bad because I got upset, and I think it makes him feel smothered. Part of my problem is that I've just been dealing with a lot of emotional stuff lately, and he's one of the few people I feel comfortable being around/talking to when I feel this way. \n\nI made the conscious decision today to really try hard not to depend on him so much, even for emotional support. I'm going to talk to him and ask him if I'm being too needy and explain that I want this relationship to work and that I will take it easy if that's what he needs. I guess what I'm wondering is if there's any way to make up for any damage that's already been done. I'm also afraid that he's going to tell me that it's ok and not feel like he can be honest with me out of fear for hurting me, and that one day out of the blue he'll just be fed up and dump me.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm studying full time in the final year of a tertiary degree, he moved to my city while I finish study and is currently working a dead end job.\n\nOn to the problems. Sometimes (these occasions are steadily increasing) I feel like we are totally different people. Where I love to go to parties, hang with friends, try to see the positive in everything, not worry about numbers, he is the polar opposite. He likes to stay home by himself, tends to be realist to the point of doom and gloom, and works out finances to the last cent, not able to spend a cent more than he needs to without careful deliberation.\n\nEvery time we fight, it's always about money or our social habits, and it's doing my head in. When I try to bring up his stingeyness, he'll always shut me down by mentioning our car he recently paid for (which I'm paying half of in three weeks or so).\n\nNow I know that we both could make some changes. I could be more sensible, he could be a little more giving, I could stay at home more, etc. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but it truly feels like we just butt heads. \n\nReddit, I'm just so tired. I'm tired of never truly seeing eye to eye with him, and feeling like there's no compromise. I love him so much and don't want to lose him, and maybe it's just the situation we're in at the moment, but something needs to change.\n\nHopefully when the semester finishes and we move away things will look up for us.

I'd much rather have her feel safe around me. \n\nShe's incredibly smart from what I've picked up so far and she was prettier than her picture which was already amazing.

It was exhausting and at times quite tough, but overall I didn't have a bad feeling.\n\n**Now to the actual issue:**\nI monitor my heart rate with a chest belt and this was the run:  You can clearly recognize the interval and before walking again my pulse was between 184 and even as high as 194.

She visited me at my school a week before my winter break started and things still seemed like they were going well and she wanted to hang out over winter break. We have hung out twice so far and both times have seemed a bit weird, the first time we just drove around looking at christmas lights and when I dropped her off she kissed me and said to call her later in the week. So the other night we saw a movie and I put my hand on her knee and she didn't seem very receptive of it, in the past when I would do this she usually grabbed my hand. We drove around for a bit after the movie and at times we were silent. When she dropped me off she just said \"see ya 'bob' (not my real name)\" I wasn't sure if I should kiss her because i had been feeling weird since she hadn't really seemed \"into\" it the last two times we had hung out. Regardless I kissed her and she seemed okay with the kiss. I said I may go out drinking the next night and she said to let her know, (if I go out tonight, I will). But I just can't help but feel concern since she hasn't seemed as into it as she had before winter break.

And if it doesn't happen, well that's alright too. \n\nWe are already determined to live within our means, pay off our student loans, and not incur any more debt. My first inclination is to use a large sum (perhaps all?) of the inheritance to pay off our student loans, which we have about 90k of in federal loans, and which is our only debt. Do you guys think that would be wise or unwise? \n\nWe are not looking to purchase any property as we aren't even sure where we will be located in the next years. We don't know a whole lot about investing, but figured that unless we were guaranteed to make more than what our interest on our student loans is, it'd be wiser to pay off the loans first. The loans are a real burden, honestly, and with the amount we have it would be very nice to get them off of our backs. The only 'need' that we have is perhaps a second car, as it is a real challenge to get to our three jobs and grad school on a single car. That, and perhaps bulking up our emergency account. \n\n \nWhat do you guys think??\nTL;DR:"}

She's an 17 year old college freshman, and hasn't completed her first week of classes.  She is a commuter and knows no one else at the school.  Also, she's in some upper level language courses, which are small and populated with upperclassmen (so, THEY all know each other).  She's shy and struggles with both depression and anxiety (like many in our family - including myself). \n\nFrom what I'm overhearing of this mini breakdown, she's feeling lost  and lonely.  She keeps saying things like: she \"can't do this,\" \"it's too much work,\" \"hate this class/teacher.\"  She doesn't know who her advisor is or what major she should choose, and to exacerbate things, we spent three hours last night trying to figure out how to get into her school email to get her homework.  I heard her saying that \"everyone seems to know where they should be and what they are doing.\"  She also says that the school isn't telling her anything, and that \"she went to the orientation and meetings,\" but still doesn't know what to do.\n\nI KNOW that she's smart - she went to a very good private school, took many honors classes, and was near the top of her class.  But, she says its just because her teachers liked her.  I know that she CAN do the work because I was with her when she was doing her upper level language homework last night and she finished double what she was supposed to do with minimal mistakes before realizing she had done too many assignments.  But, she just thinks that will make the teacher think she's weird because she didn't do it perfectly as assigned.  \n\nI also know that there is NO WAY she is the only one struggling.  I know because I felt the same way.  But she seems to feel like the only one who is having trouble adjusting, which just makes her feel even more inadequate and in-over-her-head.\nTL;DR:"}

Now that I'm an \"adult\" and am out of the house, when I go back to visit my parents at their home, I recognize his behavior as classic emotional abuse.  But not usually directed toward me.  Always toward my mom.\n\nAs my parents have gotten older, I know that my dad has chilled out a lot and that things are not nearly as bad as they once were, for the most part.  That said, there was the honeymoon stage before they got married when none of this happened at all.  But if that's the case...I can't even bear to think about how scared and alone my mom must have been at the beginning.  I know she would have been too afraid to leave.\n\nI'm 24 and came to these realizations, for the most part, a few months ago.  I have no real resources to cope with this.  This has really shattered the image I had of my parents' relationship, which I always saw as the ideal standard against which I should compare my relationships (and despite everything, I do believe that my parents REALLY love each other, at least when times are good).  It has destroyed the happy little circle I always saw my family, both nuclear and extended, as - I now understand that my mother's side of the family probably hates my father, but has never been able to say anything to me about it.  And to recognize my dad's behavior makes me feel sick and furious.  But at the same time, I still do love my dad; he's my dad, and even if he hasn't always been there for me, he's come through for most of the important stuff.  I don't want to hate him.\n\nIdeally, I would go to counseling for this, but I won't be able to afford it for at least another year.  Any advice, Reddit?  Maybe I'm internetting wrong, but Google didn't show me any real resources.\nTL;DR:"}

Been best friends over the years, losing touch but always being there for each other like family, at the drop of a hat. 1.5 years ago we had a falling out and a fight, mainly because I couldn't drop my life and party whenever she wanted me to. (Single mom, full time job, etc). I attempted to reconnect over the 1st year, to no avail. \n\nBy chance we ran into eachother and somewhat restarted our friendship, though better than nothing, it wasn't really the same. She's now 8 months pregnant. We hung out about 1.5 months ago, everything went good, she texted me the next day. Now she's barely speaking to me again. I texted her just wanting to make sure she was okay with bb and stuff, and nothing. tried again about a week later, and then she apologized saying she wasn't ignoring me, was very tired and stressed from traveling for family stuff and shed text me in a few days. That was a few weeks ago. \n\nSo. Is she just being hormonal, and not wanting to talk to me cus of her hormones? She wasn't really around when i was pregnant, 8 years ago, claiming she didn't like my ex.  But she didn't make much of an effort on our friendship or seeing my daughter even after he was out of the picture. She still claims it's because i turned down too many invites to do things that i really couldnt just up and go do because of my responsibilities.\n\nI'm just. At a loss. I don't want to bug her and be needy. But it's like, wtf man. We're friends, family. I don't deserve to be ignored all the time. I don't want to let this friendship go, but i can't help but feel like she doesn't care anymore. It's hard to keep friends the older you get.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [36 M] with my wife[36F] of 11 years, I could use some female perspective.\nPOST: I am a married man (11 years) and I am really frustrated and sad concerning my wife and I's sex life.\n\n2 years ago we were at a pretty low point in our marriage. I was close to leaving, and finally gave her an ultimatum of marriage counselor or divorce lawyer. Things have improved a lot and I finally feel like I have my best friend back. As far as how we operate as a team, our marriage has never been better.\n\nOne of the big problems 2 years ago was her total unwillingness to have sex. We went from a passionate couple having sex all the time to once every 2 months. To her credit she listened to how this made me feel as a man and her husband, and we now have sex 2-3 times a week. \n\nHere's the problem: I can tell she is doing it just for me. She loves me and wants me to be happy, so when I initiate sex she almost never tells me no, but she has the same look in her eyes I get when she asks me for help with a household project. She seems to view sex with me as a chore. I've tried very hard to communicate with her, I make sure I am a giving partner in bed, and once we get going she always seems to enjoy herself. However, if I didn't initiate, we wouldn't be having sex.\n\nI have brought this up to her and she explains that her day is very busy between a part-time job and our 2 children. She says she usually fantasizes about a bowl of ice cream, a glass of wine, some quiet time, then curling up in bed with me to cuddle and fall asleep.\n\nI can tell my wife loves me, she just doesn't seem to have any passion for me anymore. She seems to love me like a brother or close male friend. I still have a lot of passion for her and realizing how one sided it is makes me feel hopeless. So much so I am considering leaving.\n\nI could really use some female perspective on this. Am I justified in feeling this way? Am I being ridiculous? Is there anything I can do to improve this?\nTL;DR:"}

Took a while to get over that, but eventually accepted she was going to be just a friend.\n\nFast forward.\n\nShe's in a relationship with this guy for a few years now. They seem a pretty happy couple. They're both smart, and talented. She likes to write (journalist, afterall), he's a pretty good illustrator (architect, I believe). I don't know him very much beyond this.\n\nI'm still friends with her. Relationship had some awkward moments, specially right after I told her I did like her, but been a pretty normal, low maintenance friendship.\n\nNow, a few things have changed since ~7 years ago.\n\nFirst, I used to be pretty fat. Got on a diet last year, lost almost 100 pounds, and met with her (and her boyfriend, and a ladyfriend of theirs) so I could return a book I've lent.\n\nSecond, I accidentally sent her a link to an adult movie instead of an article I was trying to share, like we usually do (don't ask me why it was in my clipboard).\n\nSince then, she's been acting pretty strange. We talk majoritarily over IM as we live in different cities. As in, she's often asking me how I'm doing, what I'm up to, opening conversations, eventually complimenting me, laughing at my jokes. Even said I was in one of her dreams. And a few other, possibly related, behavior changes.\n\nNow, this would, I assume, be pretty much a very strong \"I'm interested in you\" signal. But not only she does have a boyfriend, she said back then she wasn't really interested. Now, I'm pretty bad in relationships. Hard to get signals. But this is so exaggerated that there must be something here, but I'm very much confused!\n\n**Help me, Reddit!** What does she possibly want? What should I do, considering I don't want to split them up, but would happily start a relationship with her if she were single?\nTL;DR:"}

While on her trip, she used her smartphone to check emails and Facebook. Upon arrival, Fido did send an SMS informing her that rates could apply for data roaming and such, but as most people, she was unaware of what a kilobyte was and how much that would add up to in the end.\n\nAfter coming back, she received her bill which totaled $785 (she usually pays around $50) As a student, she is obviously unable to afford that. She doesn't even have enough credit to pay for the bill. (Now before you get all clever and ask \"How could she afford a trip then?\" She couldn't. Her parents and I split the cost, because she needed the getaway real bad.)\n\nShe immediately contact Fido's customer service and after talking to a few different agents, she was informed that there was nothing they could do, having recently changed their policy regarding issues like that. They only agreed to give her a $50 credit on her next bill. I hated to see her cry and try to plead her cause on the phone and although I haven't heard the guy on the other end, she made it really clear that he was being obnoxious and arrogant, telling her that everyone knows what a kb is and that she shouldn't complain since her plan was already ridiculously cheap.\n\nSo now she has to pay, and as much as she hates that company right now, she can't afford to break her contract so she will have to endure it for another two years. Does anyone know if anything can be done to at least lower the cost of the extra charges, or is this a lost cause? I know other have had this issue before, since it is not quite clear what they charge you and it's hard to get an idea of what these extra costs are.\nWe are kind of hopeless.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [22M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 8 months, she was only having sex to block out memory of a rape\nPOST: I had known that she had problems with an eating disorder in the past, so I wasn't surprised when about two months ago she was committed because of it. Beyond that, our relationship has been fantastic. Both our families love us together, we share interests and the sex was great! This is surprising, as she told me, because she had never enjoyed sex at all, with anybody else.\n\nUntil, of course, the ED started wearing out her sex drive (so we thought). That was okay, I was happy to work with it. It hurt seeing her go through all of it, but I did and do love her, and I just wanted her to get better. A couple weeks of treatment in, she drops a number of bombshells on me. The two most important:\n\n1. She has \"gone back\" to before; she hates being a woman, hates sex, hates the way it feels, and hates worrying about pregnancy.\n\n2. A week before we started seeing each other, she was raped. She refuses to tell me any details, except that she hid it from the world and herself, and that she has made up her mind in not reporting it, and\n\n3. The only reason she was interested in sex was because, on some, subconscious level, it was her way of \"getting back\" at her rapist.\n\nMy first reaction to hearing that she was raped was uncontrollable sobbing. The staff at the hospital were very friendly and led me to the waiting room so I could cry it out. Eventually, though, it set in how fucked up it is that all the wonderful sex that we had was caused by a rape.\n\nSelfishly, I feel, I worry about the long term effect of this. If she doesn't want to have sex, it won't be long before I feel undesirable, as I've always needed that in a relationship. If she couldn't become intimate because of trauma, I would understand, but in fact, the only only reason she ever was able to do so was because of the trauma. She's still in the hospital, and since she's told me she knows it may be hard for me, I've told her I reserve my judgement until she is recovered.\nTL;DR:"}

I told him that I didn't get it. It was just a circle with a bunch of smaller circles inside it. I asked him if it was supposed to look like Dippin' Dots. He said, \"are you serious?

I often help my neighbor babysit her kid when she works late. Her kid is in first grade and they were doing a project called, \"American Heroes.\" She had to make a sock puppet of someone she considered to be an American hero. She said she wanted to make a puppet of Martin Luther King, Jr. So off we went to the craft store, where she picked out some black curly doll hair, stick on eyes, and various doll parts. We then headed to CVS to pick up some stockings to stuff with cotton to use for the actual puppet head. Being colorblind, and not wanting to be racist, I decided not to pick the darkest stocking and instead went with what I thought was a lighter brown color. She didn't help me pick the stocking. \n\nWe went home, assembled the puppet, marveled at its beauty, and I put it in her backpack to take to school the next day. Keep in mind, she's 6 and didn't help me assemble this. (Yeah, I know, I'm not a very good fake parent...)\n\nI received a call from her mom today to thank her for watching her kid and for helping her make what she called, \"an Alien version of MLK.\"\n\nTurns out the stocking I picked was not dark brown, but was olive green.

Or would discussions over math/science/lit/media uninterrupted by political alignment benefit us more?\n\nThe biggest problem I see here is that some of the time the political guns go off, we actually start bringing up economics, science, and erroneous statistics to support our own points *without actually knowing anything about them*. \n\nIt's like those conversations one has at family parties where if you say the phrase \"Hello (family relation) (name), how are you?\" results in \"Why aren't you voting for (candidate)?\"\nTL;DR:"}

What thinking should guys have when their girlfriend can hardly orgasm with them?\nPOST: We've been dating a little over a year now, and things are usually pretty great. The only problem is when we get around to having sex, she can't really orgasm with me.\n\nShe's said she is very comfortable with me. We've been to porn festivals together, we're pretty light hearted people. We openly talk about masturbation and so on. \n\nIt's just that she can't get off with me. We've tried 30 min+ of for-play with about the same amount of time(I don't keep track to the minute) of going down on her, clit stimulation during sex, just clit stimulation, and having sex with a vibrator. \n\nI can tell she's starting to feel bad because she says I make her feel really good, and wants to show it but can't. It's starting to get to me as well. I feel I'm not good enough, not attractive enough, and so on. Is it bad of me to want to experience an orgasm with her? I'd love see her in orgasmic bliss regularly, as she does with me. How should I think about this? I'm starting to resent the fact that she can't orgasm with me, and I don't like it.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Okay Reddit, my friends and I are plotting an ultimate, yet harmless, prank on a good friend of ours to end our senior year of high school. Anyone have suggestions? (info inside)\nPOST: Being that it is our senior year of high school, my friends and I naturally wanted to end the year with a bang. We started brainstorming random ideas one day and decided that we should prank a good friend of ours who was typically always the bud of our jokes for all four years of high school. He's always been a good sport about it and we thought it would be hilarious to pull one final prank on this guy.\n\nThe initial idea was to send him on a \"quest\" of some sorts using a series of letters which would dictate what he should do next to receive his next clue. It would start with placing a random letter in his locker which would tell him the rules of this \"quest\" and have subliminal clues hidden within the actual text of the document which he could (hopefully) decipher, leading him to the next clue, and so on. \n\nThe problem with this idea is our friend lacks a motive. Why would he follow up on these clues? What's in it for him? Promise of a reward? \n\nSo what I ask of you guys is:\n\n**-What are some \"demands\" or \"tasks\" we could make this guy do in order to obtain the next letter?**\n\n**-What should we promise him in order to assure he actually follows through with this quest?** \nWe wanna try and make it fun for him in the process. After all, I think it'd be pretty epic if I got a series of letters leading me on some sort of real-life quest.\n\n**-Do you have any other ideas on pranks that we might be able to implement into this one way or another?**\n\n**-Any ideas on how we could add subliminal messages into these letters?** \nKeep in mind that my friend self-admittedly isn't the brightest dude around so let's try not to make it entirely too complicated to solve.

Her interest and appetite for sex has just gone way down and I don't know how or if she'll ever get it back. \n\nI think the problem comes down to various lifestyle changes and stress.

About 5 years ago though he just stopped all contact. I hadn't heard from him or seen him for 5 years. No happy birthday, no christmas, nothing.

However, I also feel like I'm not getting the support I need at times. Lately I've been feeling like I'm giving a lot of support and not receiving much in return. I feel we have very different perspectives on the world. He tends to catastrophize, so there is something new every day that is completely world ending, and I'm running out of energy to keep up. \n\nThe times when he is not stressed out about something are great, we love spending time together, and I feel like he really gets me.

Now, thankfully, most of that bad debt has dropped off. I'm currently working on rebuilding my credit. I opened a Fingerhut account (ripoff pricing, I know, but it has done a lot for me so far), and after a few months of on-time, over-the-minimum payments, I have been able to secure three new credit cards for the first time in years. I am going to use these just as I use cash, and pay them off in full, every month. I had applied for a Discover card, and on that pull, I had a FICO score of 633 (up from ~595 in July).\n\nHere's my question -- I am planning on moving out of state to the New England area in about 16 months, and want to work hard on my credit so I don't have to worry about being able to secure housing/getting a job. My goal is to get my FICO score up to 700 at least, but I have some unpaid medical bills in collections that are about 3 years old at this point. So 1) is it likely I can get my credit up to a 700 in that time frame if I'm religiously paying my credit card bills and keeping my credit utilization very low (~5%); and 2) would it be better if I tried to arrange a payment plan for the medical bills or let them age off? I'm currently in my final year of undergrad, and I don't really have the money to pay those bills, and I will have to start paying my federal loans soon. \n\nI want to be realistic about what I can achieve, but I also want to be pretty aggressive about getting my finances in order. My assumption is that it would be better to take care of my credit cards and student loans first, since they have a flawless payment history, and let the medical debt age off. This subreddit has been so incredibly helpful, and I feel like it's really helping me to make sound personal finance decisions.

His initial phone interview was a slam dunk, and the follow up interview with two of the firm's partners went extremely well, by all accounts.\n\nA week later, one of the partners phoned to thank him for participating in the interview process, but had to regretfully inform him that they selected another candidate.  He was pretty devastated, and bitter.  It was a job he really wanted, and thought for sure he was a shoe-in for.  When he told me about this, I advised him to write a thank you note to the firm, as difficult as it might be at this point.  \n\nHe asked \"Why?\".  I responded \"For a number of reasons.\":\n\n* It reflects graciousness on your part, especially at a moment when most people aren't very gracious, thus differentiating you as someone unique.\n\n* That graciousness will elevate your stature in the eyes of the people who passed you over, and might even make them question themselves for having done so.\n\n* If things don't work out with their selected candidate, that gracious thank you note might just propel you to the top of the list of rejected candidates worth revisiting for a second look.\n\n* It might make them realize what a quality candidate you are and spur them to see if there's any other openings at their firm that you might not have been aware of and which they now feel you might be a good fit for.\n\nHe begrudgingly agreed and asked for my help in crafting the note.  I told him it should pattern itself on the following structure:\n\n* Acknowledgement of their decision\n* Expression of disappointment (without sounding devastated or bitter)\n* Sincere wishes for success with their selection\n* Expression of thanks for the opportunity to interview with them\n* A request to keep him in mind if things don't work out with their selection\n\nHe followed my advice and immediately received a response indicating that he was at the top of their list to contact if their selected candidate didn't work out.\nTL;DR:"}

He even went as far as to drop F-bombs and stuff.\n\nI let that discourage me, and I haven't been back since. I couldn't handle being a fuck up anymore, so I left. Now I don't even know why I wanted to be a firefighter. I was never much of an A-type person in the first place.\n\nSometimes that desire to be a firefighter ignites, but instantly I am reality checked by that one night where I fucked up. I may have continued to fuck up, and fuck up some more. I could dedicate thousands of dollars to schooling to become a firefighter, and just have it blown away because I'm too much of a fuck up to pass through the academy. \n\nBesides, fire departments can't afford to have fuck ups. If you fuck up, people can die.\n\nIt just makes me sad and furious at the same time because people were proud of me for choosing to go down this path. Not only that, but I finally felt like I had some idea of what I wanted to do with my life. Now its all just kind of back to scratching down ideas for jobs I don't even know if I would like.\nTL;DR:"}

My fiancee brought her car in to the service center of a local dealership for a state inspection, and it ended up that the repairs they did caused a fire in the engine compartment the day she drove away (for all the auto-savvy out there, the guy forgot to fully seal the valve cover gasket).\n\nWe're getting a few thousand in insurance money, but she needs a car for her job, and the dealership has already admitted fault.  Everything has been smooth with them until a week ago - they claimed they could get us in a car valued at $11,000 for the low low price of $8,000.  We couldn't say 'yes' fast enough, but a few days later the price starts creeping up, and now they're telling us it will be closer to $9,500 with all taxes and fees.\n\nAfter the initial experience with the dealership (where they said they were so so sorry and will do anything), we've been dealing with the GM of the dealership, who I've personally argued with for about an hour.

But I feel so unfufilled.\n\nI have been feeling very disjointed from myself. Relationships that used to be very meaningful to me are almost annoying (I camped out in my room practically my whole christmas break to avoid my family. They just drive my insane now-a-days). One relationship I really tried to strengthen over break was a total flop. I drove freaking way across the state to visit a new friend over break and spend new years with him and when we came back to university for an oranization retreat, hebwouldn't even talk to be. Just a few scant sentences about himself. And juat to add, this person has already caused a big heap of emotional stress for quite awhile, but  breally care for him, I don't know why. Half the time I dont even feel like I am living my own life. It's like I am watching a movie of someone else. I feel like I am a lousy person because all these felationships arent working out and I just get awkward whrn I try to fix them.  Or when I talk, I clam up and word vomit or just become too serious. Im dull all ogf  a sudden. I never used to be.\n\nIve been journaling and lately cutting to deal with all this.  Cutting (my thighs) makes me feel more in control of myself and my emotions. Like it is a phsical manifestation of what I am feeling that I have total control of how it is made (I can choose how deep and long the cuts are and where).

We dated for a year previously, then broke up because things weren't working out. (Jealousy, insecurities, fell for another guy.) So, after a couple months we ended up getting back together and trying things again. Things went smoothly for a while, however, things have been rough lately. I'll just list out my concerns and problems with the relationship and hopefully you guys can tell me what's what. \n\n1. She is extremely emotional. She has anxiety and depression issues and often gets very very upset out of nowhere. I want to help her and support her but this happens every couple of days and she's so very difficult to help when she's upset. She says that she feels like no one cares about her and that she's not beautiful and she's so tired of being so sad all the time. I do my best to console her by telling her she's beautiful and that lots of people care about her and that I want her to know she's an amazing person. Sometimes it helps for a bit but it always happens again a day or two after. She thinks I haven't done enough to help her and that I should stay up and talk to her. Stuff like that. I really feel like she expects me to be her therapist and try to help her with an issue that needs professional help. Recently my patience has run dry and I get extremely annoyed and frustrated when she has an emotional issue, which she has faulted me on saying that I'm not empathizing with her and that I'm not willing to help her. She also sometimes uses this as an excuse for randomly exploding at me or being irrational. \n\n2. She has a tendency to overreact to small things. Like when I disagree with her on something she suddenly gets really rude and snotty and raises her voice. \n\n3. I'm always the bad guy. Always. No matter what we disagree about, and no matter how much I want to be able to tell her I think she's being irrational, I end up surrendering and telling her it won't happen again and that I'll get better. \n\nI'll give more updates and supply info later.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: After 18 months, I still want her...\nPOST: This story will probably sound really lame to most of you, but I'm pretty lost right now. Two and a half years ago, my freshman year in college I was a huge gamer. I had been playing WoW with the same group of people for 3 years at that point. One of these people was a girl, one of my closest \"e-friends\". Over the course of those three years we had gotten closer and closer, eventually leading up to a long-distance relationship starting my freshman year.\n\nThe relationship lasted a year, we had some really fun times and we also had our fair share of fights. To sum up 90% of these fights: she wouldn't want to talk to me on the phone/said she would call me and never did, I would rage and she would make me feel like shit by telling me that I'm making her feel like shit. Etc, etc.\n\nEventually these fights led to her ending it, saying she couldn't take it anymore (she was always the one to want to be left alone during fights, I was always the one to want to tackle problems head on). 18 months have passed since then, we still talk regularly as friends (she's made that very clear) but this is where I'm stuck.\n\nDuring the relationship and currently we were/are both virgins. We had talked about being each others firsts many, many, many times. In her previous relationships, one of which lasted two years, she declined to lose her virginity. The thought of her and myself losing that to someone else honestly makes me sick. I still love her, I know her better than any of her other friends by far and I can usually predict her reactions/feelings on things but this one thing just throws me for a loop. If she felt strongly enough to want to be that close to me during the relationship, why does she feel so strongly now against not wanting anything to do with me romantically? The two times I've asked her this question since we broke up I've been told, \"I don't know...\" followed by either a quick subject change or her just flat out ignoring me for the rest of the day.\nTL;DR:"}

Instead of telling him exactly what happened, I told him something else hoping we could just move on... at the end, I gave in and told him exactly what happened because I felt guilty. \n\nSince it was part of my life before I met him, did he have the right to push me to tell him everthing as happened? I know I should've been stronger and could've just told him I wasn't ready to share my entire past with him just yet. I should've set a boundary. I am very open about myself, my mistakes, the things I like/dislike... But when it came to that particular part of my life, I didn't even know how to verbalize what had happened in my past. I felt the pressure to say something, and of course that \"something\" should've never come out of my mouth. After I told him everything I felt so exposed, he broke up with me saying he couldn't trust me anymore BUT perhaps he could talk to me again if I could prove that he could trust me again. Why give me hope? :(\n\nAs part of the deal, he asked me not to contact him at all. Our relationship went from being super good to just a sudden break up because of my past, which had nothing to do with the present. I miss him.

Because of this she's afraid that people won't be there for her when she needs them so she breaks off the relationship before it gets to far. I've repeatedly told her that we just need to communicate about issues we have and I'm more than happy to give her space/anything to make her comfortable.

While in college I met the girl of my dreams and we've been happily dating since my last year of school. She was a year behind me, so last year when she graduated she moved in with me and I proposed.\n\nShortly after proposing I got orders to Yokosuka, Japan (which is what I wanted because I joined to travel). However, the military doesn't recognize fianc\u00e9s as family so she was not able to move with me. There was lots of talking and me comforting her about me leaving, but luckily I should be back in the states next year. So we decided she should move home with her parents, work in the area to save some money, and use the time for planning our wedding next February.\n\nSo this is where I took a small prank too far, I waited until afternoon here (early morning April 1st for her) and messaged something saying \"we need to talk, it's about the ship\" knowing she wouldn't see it until she woke up. I then waited until around 6:00 A.M. her time and called. I went on to tell her that something came up and that we were doing a 6 month surge to the Persian Gulf and I wouldn't be home until August, 2016. She started being upset, asking if i was serious, and then began crying pretty hard when I said I was. Once the crying started I felt bad and was about to tell her April Fool's when she said \"I can't deal with this right now\" and ended the call. She didn't answer for nearly two hours and apparently wasn't checking her Facebook messenger because by the time I got in touch with her she had already informed most of our families the wedding wasn't going to happen on time and was about to email the venue and reschedule (which costs around $1000).\nTL;DR:"}

I've gotten to the point where I love her irrevocably. We'd known each other for a while before that. Anyway, so things have been going along about as smoothly as they can given her PTSD and depression and trust issues. She was molested at 8 and raped again a year or two ago. That stuff I can handle fairly easily. Any time things start getting hot and heavy, most of the time we have to stop because she'll have an episode. Anyway, yesterday we were messing around and I could tell she was repressing it, but she kept going so I did too. Eventually she couldn't help it any more and broke down. I should also mention that she is Asexual. She likes sex and pleasure but doesn't like to see or touch anything. I can handle that. So what's the issue? Yesterday after she calmed down, we were talking and she said that when she gets baptized she doesn't want to have sex until she's married. Now, I know that that will be tough, and I promised her I would love and support her no matter what. But as soon as she left it started bugging me. She didn't just today make this decision. That's part 1 of my issue with this. Number two is that even a day later it's still eating at me that, am I really so shallow that this is going to mess things up? I mean, only a week ago she finally told me she loves me. I'm the second guy she has ever said that to. I kept telling her that sex is just a perk, I'm not in this just for that. But if that's not going to happen, am I not committed enough that I'd end it? I'm torn. What do you think?\nTL;DR:"}

Help?\nPOST: Hey everyone, well this must be an odd request, but here's the story:    \nMy Dad, after fighting with liver cancer last year had to have a transplant. He bled out on the operating table, and had to be brought back to life twice. After this, complications arose: He had a bile duct obstruction, scarring caused from being open too long on the table. He had to have a PTC done, where tubes are inserted into his body, and it's been a struggle ever since. After all of this, we've recently learned that he has to go through yet another liver transplant because the tubes have begun scarring his new liver and it needs to be removed or he will die.\nThis being said, it's his birthday soon, and he needs all the motivation and courage he can get to go through this horror a second time. This man has been through so much more than even these horrible transplants in his life, and my Mom and I have come up with a great birthday surprise that would probably make him the happiest he's ever been. I want to put Reddit to the test and see if we can't get a surprise \"Happy Birthday\" from well known celebrities! He's been a musician his whole life, and one of his favorite musicians is Dave Grohl, and if I'm not mistaken, Dave's done an AMA not too long ago. This would be great if this can happen, but I'm stumped on how to get this done. Please help, Reddit? It would be wonderful.\n(\nTL;DR:"}

For some reason or another the topic of charlie horse (aka dead leg) came up and my friend said she had never gotten one. A grin from ear to ear appeared across my face, I told her to stand up so I can give her one.\n\nTold her about it, gave her one and she almost started crying, saying it hurts and that I hit her to hard. I didn't hit her hard, that's for sure. However, she was wincing in pain for like 3 minutes and then acted all grumpy face for the next 40 minutes or so. In the meantime she was complaining about me giving her a charlie horse, even though she said it was okay to do it. My friend, trying to be the white knight told me to apologize, I said no. She said we weren't sleeping over (we sorta needed to because we were drinking a bit). A lot of fuss later I ended up having to apologize, which took me about 5 minutes because I tried to do it as horrible as possible, embellishing the apology, giving it in old English, etc.\nTL;DR:"}

I always had a crush on her, (that feeling has been on and off) and we've been getting pretty close since this past summer. \n            We would call each other every other day, etc. But we have a huge religion barrier.. She's a \"born again\" literalist christian, so she can be kind of ignorant in some discussions. I am agnostic, and pretty progressive in that aspect.       \n Recently, my other friend was messing around, and posted something about some satanist on his Instagram. I made nothing of it, but when we began discussing the \"blindness\" of certain people; I casually, jokingly mentioned her.\n          She saw this, and felt understandably hurt. I violated her trust, and took full responsibility for it. It was a stupid, childish decision on my part.. So, it's been a week since my apology. She forgave me, but had \"nothing to say\". \n             She called today, but I didn't hear the phone ring (just my luck). I called back, no answer.

I am worried that we won't be able to make it. I worry about how we will be living and if we will even have food at the table.

Advice?\nPOST: Ever since I met my husband he had told me his father was dead - he was involved with some drug cartels and was killed. I never thought much of it until one day I was with my mother-in-law and we were talking about her ex-husband (my husband's dad). Apparently, he was still alive but in prison. He was incarcerated for assaulting her and causing her to miscarry their twin daughters (my husband was about 9 and had witnessed the whole thing). I told her that my husband said he was killed but she has no idea where he got that misinformation from.\n\nNow me being way too curious, got his name from my husband's birth certificate and looked him up in the county court records. I first found their divorce record and everything checked out that it was them (on a side note, the case records noted that my mother-in-law was pregnant but he was denying paternity. I know it was my husband she was pregnant with since it was 2 months before he was born). He also has a good amount of cases against him, two child support cases and about four insurance fraud ones. I was eventually able to track him online and found out he was out of prison and living in the same city as us. Five minutes away from our home to be more specific.\n\nSo after everything, I don't plan to tell my husband, unless he asks about it, but I feel like I'm lying to him by withholding this information. I know that while his parents were together his dad was ok for the most part, he was a huge drunk but he spoiled his family with expensive clothing, dinners, jewelry, etc. I'm not so sure how my husband and his dad's relationship was since he never talks about it, but it doesn't seem like he hates him.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some advice as to how to deal with this information and if it'll do more harm than good telling anyone about it. Thanks for checking out this very long read and any words of advice is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

I wasn't hurt by just this it was the fact I felt she lead me on with talks of our future and the fact she was dishonest. \n\nAfter this I initiated no contact for a few days. I have a date this saturday but I cant get her off my mind. Yesterday I went and picked up my stuff from her place. I didnt want/expect to see her but it was inevitable.

I used to play video games from sun-up to sun-down.  Now there is this big hole in my time where I have nothing to do but browse Reddit and read web-comics. Hours of time just simply wasted. I'm the kind of person that can reflect on that and obviously see it's not the right thing to do. I need something I can pour time into and then that something become a career.\n\nFor those that might suggest an instrument I already play guitar casually. A music career might be nice but I don't think I'm good enough to be able to play in a band. I have a feeling I'd audition and then simply get a polite \"Sorry you're just not what we're looking for\". Also only playing by myself for a number of years I'd have no idea how to play in a band. Another worry would be making a career out of it. I'm sure much more talented people than me have failed. The problem being I don't really have any childhood dreams. The earliest memory I can think of is me blowing out my candles on my third birthday then it jumps to me playing 'Legend of Zelda a link to the past' with my uncle. Who coincidentally inspired my cousin to play guitar who then inspired me to play.  But I've never seen something and said \"I'd really like to do that\". \n\nThe closest I can think was growing up I had the idea I would one day make video games so Programming is the first thing that comes to my mind except I've taken quite a interest in artificial intelligence here recently instead of my original thought of making video games(I also know now that there is much more to making video games then a little bit of programming :P ). I know a little about it because I delved into it so I'm not completely in the dark when it comes to it.\n\nIf someone is to suggest programming I'm inclined to ask if you'd please  give me a place to start and then after that starting point where to go from there. If I'm going to start a craft that can be a career I plan on mastering it.\nTL;DR:"}

She's boring and obnoxious and has poor manners and follows all of the petty bullshit in pop culture that makes having a conversation unbearable.\n\nBut no matter how I try explaining to her that our financial decisions are slowly driving us towards bankruptcy she will not hear it.

The worst part was that neither of us had our driver's licenses, and my dad had to drive her home. I went too, of course, but it was probably the the most uncomfortable 15 minute drive of my life.

I dislike it more and more every day. I've always been inclined to creativity, but I don't really have much of an opportunity to express that at school. Supposedly, I'm an intelligent person, but am by no means and intellectual, and the academic nature of university bores me to tears. \n\nAdditionally, it's likely that I have ADHD (according to a psychiatrist), and my work habits are awful. Partly because I'm disinterested and partly because I can't figure out how to manage my time.\n\nI'm starting to consider dropping out and going to art school to study graphic design and/or animation (something that has interested me for a few years), or studying to become a pilot. However, I have no solid plans at the moment, so I'm stuck in university.\n\nI don't get a lot of joy out of university, and since I'm likely to be stuck here for at least a few more months, I need advice on how to try and enjoy it. I try to enjoy my classes, and sometimes I succeed, but I almost always feel at least slightly miserable at the end of every day. I have occasional conversation with my classmates and roommates, but I find that I prefer my own company to others. Parties don't excite me all that much, either. I listen to music all the time to help boost my mood, but I've grown mostly indifferent to it. I'd love to be out exploring, but I sit in my room all the time, trying to gather my virtually non-existent will-power in order to get work done. I've always feared that I'm chronically lazy, but I think it's my disinterest and general semi-misery that makes doing my work hard. It's not difficult for me to do things that I find interesting.\n\nWhat's the best way to make this an enjoyable experience? Or at least something I can be indifferent to?\n\nP.S. Sorry if that was all over the place. It's 2:30 am here, and my thoughts are a bit jumbled.\nTL;DR:"}

She still says she loves me so much and wants to get married but she wants to enjoy her 20s. I have been stuck in this limbo for a month now she says we arent broken up just not together. I dont know what to make of it. She still wants to keep in touch and be best friends for now. She was my first serious girlfriend but she has been with a lot of guys before me.

I proceed with interviewing both candidates, and offer each of them a position on my staff as of yesterday. I offered Joanna the first position (lower-paying and a step down), and Chelsea the second position (higher-paying and a step above the first position).\n\nAs of this morning, Jessica, who left my department, has realized she does not enjoy her new role and wants to come back and reprise her old position. She knows the job inside and out and is a company asset. If I hadn't offered the position to another candidate, I would gladly welcome her back. But I have already made offers and both candidates accepted. \n\nI met with two execs at the company today to try and find a solution. The execs don't want to lose Jessica as an employee and want to giver her what she wants - her old job back.

I cannot even begin to describe the size/bitterness/torture that ensued with each dose. It's the worst thing I've ever tasted and the pill was so big that it would often get stuck in the back of my throat (har har) so I would have to choke it down, but while dealing with the AWFUL taste of this thing.\n \nSo, on the third night of taking this my bf suggested that I just toss it in my mouth and chug water. It lodged itself smack at the back of my tongue. Not only could I not swallow it, but the flavor was so bad I started dry heaving. I ran to the bathroom to scrub the back of my tongue which of course set off my gag reflex and I threw up all over the sink. I washed it down and scrubbed the back of my tongue again. Gag. Gag. I'm about to throw..... And it came. The casserole dinner that my mom had so generously made for us was now all over my toilet seat because I couldn't open the lid in time. It ricocheted onto the side of the sink, the floor, the shower curtains, rugs, everything you can imagine. My boyfriend walks in, \"you okay?\" And after assuring him that I was, he simply said, \"I'm not cleaning that shit up\" and walked away. Can you blame him?\nTL;DR:"}

How?\nPOST: Gradually over the years I've come to the personal opinion that I don't agree with organized religion.  I come from a relatively conservative Christian family.  I always thought of my parents as non-judgmental, accepting people.  Upon this realization, I was a little worried, but always kept it in the back of my head that they are sane, smart people, and would accept me no matter what.  \n\nThe very night I was going to tell them, my grandmother, informed my parents that she had become an atheist.  The way they talked about her almost made me sick.  My mother talked about how she wasn't going to be saved, and my dad just sat silent with a look of disapproval.  When they talk about her, they often make snide remarks about her decision.  This, of course, made me shut up and not say anything about my own situation.  Their behavior almost makes me ashamed.  What should I do? Should I tell them?  I realize my situation and atheism aren't the same thing, but it still worries me.\nTL;DR:"}

It turns out when you update your name in Gmail, it updates your name on old messages as well, and this is how I found out that my ex-spouse has come out as a trans man.  His new name is somewhat unusual and I was able to Google it and find his new Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Just as an aside, I don't do anything like this normally -- I wasn't searching for him at the time, don't vanity google him, anything like that.  \n\nWe have been no-contact for about two years.  He didn't contact me to tell me, not that I would have expected him to.  It's his own business.  But we dated for 4 years before getting married, including a long period of living together, and I never suspected that he felt this way at all.  Our divorce wasn't related to anything like this at all (at least as far as I know) and was because of cheating.\n\nSince I found out, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  I've identified as a lesbian for several years but did date men prior to coming out, so I don't know why exactly this shakes me so much.  Maybe it's because I feel like he kept an enormous secret while we were together, which makes me sad.  But I also have other conflicting feelings which are kind of mean.  I find myself really repelled by this even though again this person's life is really none of my business anymore.  I'm not transphobic or into the only-born-women-are-women kind of radical feminism; to use the cliche, I have trans* friends.

He is getting along well with most of the people there and is making new friends, but also has been pretty stressed out about some things at his job too. He is working with a lot of young women who are inexperienced in the business and look to him for advice. I fully trust him. Given his personality and the way he does things I can say with complete certainty that he is not cheating.  \n\nThe main problem is this.. I flew in last night for a visit. I'd asked him to not masturbate that day (for sexy purposes.. Not because I'm anti masturbation). We had good sex that night. \nThis morning after he'd left for work I got on his laptop (I asked for permission). He forgot to close out of the browser and I was immediately hit in the face with a receipt for some porn he purchased only a few hours before I arrived yesterday.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 5 years, and have lived together for the past year. We have grown up so much together in the past few years, and overall I am very happy with the life we have built together. \n\nI guess we will begin at the beginning. We started dating when I was in my first year of Uni and has seen me through the highs and lows. I graduated in April from my second degree, and I was blissfully lucky to get a job in my career right out of school. This has all been great, and he has been supportive but I think that my success makes him insecure as well. \n\nMy boyfriend is very smart, but has had a difficult time with school. He has some social anxiety, and difficulty focusing during classes. He dropped out in high school, and has attempted a few times to go back without much luck. He also hasn't had a steady career, though he does excel at every job he tries. \n\nSo when my boyfriend tries to compare us side-by-side it can seem one sided. He will focus on school, or work, or even appearances and point to the fact that I am \"better\" than him. Once or twice he has told me that he knows that I am going to leave him for someone that I work with, which is very frustrating to hear. \n\nHe is my soft place to fall at the end of a stressful day, and he works so hard to make our house a home. I tell him constantly I appreciate everything he does, but he hates to go out places with me because the inevitable \"What do you do?\" question will come up.\n\nI understand his frustration, and I try my best to encourage him but his negativity against himself is starting to wear me down. I hope that some of you may have gone through similar situations/understand what he might need to hear so that I can help him through this time.\nTL;DR:"}

I have been trying to put up with my parent's ( age 40) verbal abuse due to these \"bad grades\". They keep on saying how I'll grow up to be nothing and live in the streets and even when I do my best to bring home good grades, they still antagonize me.\n\nIn the beginning of school, I was very positive and wanted to work for a good grades because this was my most important year but unfortunately, all that negativity went away went my parents started to gather these verbal insults. At this moment, I'd rather be outside until midnight or locked up in my room than be around them, but of course, I can't hide forever so I try my best to ignore them because whenever I have a conversation with me, its always about school and how my grades are not going up. The negativity is getting to me and I've realized that my thoughts are becoming very pessimistic. Its very hard to handle because my parents are threatening to remove my outdoor plans which will result. Maybe this problem will be fixed over time but at this point, I just want to give up and avoid talking to them altogether.

But I am not taking this breakup very well. Of all the people I've met, she was the only one I was truly excited to be with. Being with someone whom I love and am excited about is probably of the highest priority in my life, even higher than having a well-paid job or my PhD.

We met almost two years ago, and have been in a serious relationship since December 2011. We are raising our son together, a five-month-old wonderful boy. We have a great relationship, good communication, we're best friends, and we love each other deeply. We're a very happy family. My SO loves our son more than he loves me and would do anything for him.\n\nHowever, we know that our son is not biologically my SO's. I dated my ex on and off since mid-2010. It was kind of a toxic relationship. He was eight years older than I was, and was verbally and emotionally hurtful. I stayed with him despite these things because I was young and stupid, and I didn't know how to get out without feeling guilty and placing all of the blame on myself.\n\nI found out that I was pregnant in December 2011. I was completely shocked. I told my ex, and he asked me to get an abortion. I knew that I would not get an abortion. I also didn't want to raise the child with him because I didn't think he would be a very good father or partner... so we broke up. And almost a week later, I found out that he had killed himself.\n\nI did not go to the memorial and I have not spoken to his family since before he died. \n\nMy SO and I don't know how we should tell our son when he's older. We also aren't sure if we should tell his family. I don't know if I'm comfortable with it, but I also feel bad about feeling uncomfortable with it.\n\nI guess I just want to know what others would do in my situation. How would you tell your child? Would you introduce the child to his/her biological family? I'm so confused and torn about everything.\nTL;DR:"}

Yesterday I received a call from my ex's mother and she said that he has been fighting cancer for a while now and she thinks I should go and see him. \n\nI went almost immediately. When I got there, we hugged for 5 minutes or so, not saying anything. He looked so skinny. I asked him why he didn't call me and he said that \"he didn't want to bring me down.... like [he] always [does]\". I remember in one of the last conversations that we had, that I told him that I was too good for him, that he just brings me down. We were in the middle of a divorce, emotions were running high, but I guess he must have taken it to heart. He was really upset and crying. He was also on something, I assume morphine. After that he just kept asking me to go \"please go, please go.\" Eventually he called the nurse, who came and asked me to leave.\n\nI feel horrible and I don't know what to do. I didn't speak to his doctor because I was only there for 10 minutes, if that. Later that night I called his room and after I said that it was me, he hung up. His mother said that \"this might be it.\" I don't feel right, just leaving things the way they are, but that seems to be what he wants. He doesn't have any siblings, never really had friends and as far as I know, he's not dating anyone. So it's just his mom that's there. What should I do?

I've been with my girlfriend for ~2.5 years now. Today she gave me my present, a 5x5 watercolor painting she made of me and my cat last night. Believe me when I say that I'm not an overly materialistic person, and I truly am a believer in 'It's the thought that counts.' But I guess my problem is that I just don't see too much thought in this gift. \n\nI know her work, she is a truly talented artist. This just looks so rushed and uninspired. It's small, poorly detailed, the proportions are off and she clearly made mistakes and didn't feel like starting over. She painted my eyes dark brown. My eyes are blue. There was no card or note, it was hastily thrown in a cheesy gift bag. She painted it last night and bought a small frame for it this morning. I don't want to be that guy that isn't satisfied with a birthday gift, but I can't help but wonder how important I really am to her if after nearly three years in each other's lives she doesn't even know what color my eyes are. \n\nIf it was from just a friend, I would loved to have received this (or any) gift. But she's my girlfriend, in a serious relationship, and if I plan on spending the rest of my life with her, I just want to know that she genuinely cares. Am I being unappreciative?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [39 M] with the girl I recently started dating [29 F] - How to keep a long distance relationship going?\nPOST: So I am 39, and I have recently started dating a woman I have been interested in for years. A little backstory : When I first met her, I was in a relationship and had some pretty serious drug issues so naturally she was not interested. We met again a year later, and she ended up hooking up with a friend of mine, who treated her terribly (we are not friends any longer), stalked her for 9 months, and generally made life difficult for her. Since she knew we still were talking at that time, she didn't want to get involved with me because she didn't want him to know where she lived.\n\nA year or two later I started talking to her again, and asked her out. She said yes! We went out on a few dates and got along impossibly well. We have great conversations, we laugh together often, and its been going very well. \n\nSo now we are in a long distance relationship, living about an hour apart. Our schedules are very different, so for the most part we only see each other one day a week. My job is flexible, so I can often get an extra day to spend with her, but its still not that much time.\n\nShe has told me that when my lease is up, she might want to make the move to be closer to each other. I have a roommate, and I don't want to leave him stuck so I cant get a place for us for about 8 more months. He also is very adamant against her being there alone when I am there, so leaving her a key and letting her wait for me at my house is difficult.\n\nSo my question is : What can I do to maintain this? I really want this to work out, and the more I get to know her, the more I think she is likely the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. 9 months seems like a long time to ask someone to wait, and I want to somehow be present enough in her life where she feels satisfied with this until we can be together more often\nTL;DR:"}

We rushed into things and loved our bodies more so than our minds, afaik we should have just been fuck buddies, but me being inexperienced with regards to relationships, dove in head first to get some life experience.

Again, it was only 6 months, and there were doubts along the way, so I started getting over it before the break up even came. I'm more confused about whether she's still trying to cope, or if she's trying to X me out of her life. Which is difficult in her situation seeing that we run around in the same circles, and go to the same clubs on the weekend. We're bound to bump into each other a few times a month, so I, trying to settle down the awkwardness of acting like we've never met, say Hi and make conversation.\n\nThe issue here is that she dreaaads this. She keeps saying that she can't talk to me and she needs space, but it's not like I'm actively trying to contact her, or find ways to run into her, and it's been 2 months. I should also mention that our break up was very mutual, there was no big fight, everything folded on pretty good terms, we even went out for dinner after and said we were willing to be friends.\n\nSo I'm not looking for advice as much as some of your own experiences and views on how break ups should \"work\". I feel like I don't have any past experience to draw on to get an idea of what's really going on here, so I'm left feeling confused.\nTL;DR:"}

I enjoy spending time together. We are not in an exclusive relationship yet, mainly because I'm not sure of my feelings towards him yet (he has expressed that he likes me and hopes to become exclusive but is willing to wait). I find him very nice and caring, as well as physically attractive. Whenever he touches me -- when we cuddle on the couch, when he has his arms around me, I do feel the chemistry... but there are some issues that I haven't ironed out yet.\n\nI consider myself a relatively shy and quiet introvert -- I sometimes have difficulty starting conversations with complete strangers, but yet, I thrive if the person I'm talking to is an extrovert. I can carry on conversations perfectly fine in those cases. This guy that I'm seeing, to put it simply, is a man of few words. The time we spend together, a large amount of it is in silence. While I find that the silence is quite comforting at times, I get tired of having to initiate conversations that don't last. He has met a couple of my friends, and even my friends find him 'extremely quiet' and wonder how I deal with it. (I would say that 90% of my friends are extroverts, if that matters)\n\nThis is going to sound very mean, but the other issue I have is that I find his accent very unattractive -- that, and his enunciation isn't particularly clear makes it difficult for me (and also my friends) to understand him at times.

I received an offer for an 8-week internship in another state that is paying me pretty well (for my profession), but is not providing any housing assistance (other than salary). I was accepted to a paid program over the summer that allows me to go to Rome for the first month of summer, which my internship has been happy to work around. \n\nSo I have been having a little trouble finding a place to live in the city where the internship is, but I managed to find a place and spoke to the roommates and everything looks great! The only problem is that because I'm staying only 2 out of the 3 months, she is thinking she might be able to find someone else to take it for the full time, but could just give it to me for the two and bite the bullet on the third month out of convenience. This is the issue I've had with everyone who is subleasing there (they are all grad students as well). I'm not really sure if there are any other affordable options there outside of temporary subleases, but I have looked around pretty extensively and this seems to be a pretty good situation.\n\nSo, I'm wondering how to split the rent with my boyfriend in our apartment and if I should maybe offer this girl a little extra to secure the apartment in the other city so I don't end up with nothing. If my boyfriend and I didn't live together I would have subleased our apartment, but that's a whole other issue that I guess doesn't even matter. I can give numbers if necessary. I attend grad school on a half-tuition need-based scholarship and take out loans for the rest (kill me now) and my boyfriend is also paying off loans. The internship is a really great opportunity, and honestly my first real job experience besides teaching for extra money at the school and the jobs I had in undergrad to pay for college.\n\nJust wondering what other people think. Thanks so much in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

It is such a relief. Let me explain. \n\nWhen she called and broke up with me, it was a shock. We were seeing each other within the week (there was distance between us). Why then? When I had a tearful call with her right after, she implied that I hadn't made her feel valued, that I hadn't \"fought\" hard enough for her. Aside from every vacation day and spare dollar I had spent on her, that is. I was gutted. While I was able to move on after about a month, I had guilt that lingered. \n\nThat was a year ago. Turns out, she had been cheating on me. She made the mistake of bragging about it online, talking about how it was fun, dangerous, and she didn't feel bad at all. \n\nIt was the grossest, most vile thing anyone has done to me. Yet I found out nearly a year after we broke up. And every ounce of guilt, every molecule of feeling for her is completely gone now. She broke up because she is a cheater and a liar. \n\nIt is ultimately, exonerating.\nTL;DR:"}

I was never a perfectionist, but I was always a dreamer. My dream was to be a famous singer. \n\nBy high school I was acting and in singing groups. I sang and played piano solo for multiple events, usually to crowds of 400 or more. It scared me but I loved the attention. \n\nIn college I finished writing an album and recorded it. I didn't really market it since I wasn't happy with the outcome. I finished college by 21 and am now about a year out. \n\nI don't have much to complain about. I have a steady job and make about $40k a year. I have an apartment in one of the nicest cities in the US. I have no debt/loans. I have a loving boyfriend and friends. I've travelled to 14 countries (and proudly can say I paid for it all myself). \n\nEveryone thinks I'm doing great but I'm depressed all the time. I'm trying to have a steady and successful life to fill the void of fame that I've wanted since a child. I'm looking to go to grad school at the university I work for since it will be funded, but it's a 3 year commitment which means I can kiss a music career out the door. \n\nI've never even tried to make it work. Something has always held me back. I get so frustrated seeing so many people have their 15 minutes of Internet fame and I can't even achieve that. \n\nI often want to isolate myself from my relationships to focus on these goals but it's tiring. I feel conflicted at all times. My dad lived in NYC for 12 years when he was younger and pursued being an artist. He put his life on hold and didn't achieve that so maybe that's why I'm afraid. Not sure. Really need some advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I liked the work, especially when something went wrong and I needed to figure it out. But, because it was a small company in a small town with no complicated servers to setup or anything, they didn't require that I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, certificates, or prior experience (To indicate how small, I also handled their graphic design, web design, and all of their shipping/receiving).\n\nI am just about to finish college, but not for Computer Science. I'm getting a degree in the humanities, but I have really good problem solving skills and I've been using a computer since I was six. I'm the kind of person that has never had any \"formal\" training in computers but who is capable of figuring out most problems if an issue comes up.\n\nThat all being said, I am considering future career options. One avenue I am looking at is potentially becoming a Network Technician or a System Administrator. My question to you all is this: What's the best path for me to consider if I want to do this that doesn't require me getting a 4-year degree in Computer Science? If I get the A+, Network+, and Security+ Certificates from CompTIA, will this be enough to get me an entry-level job? Or do most places REQUIRE a Bachelor's in Computer Science? Would I be better off going to a technical school or community college for two years after I finish my humanities BA? \n\nAny advice that you all can offer would be awesome.\nTL;DR:"}

I told him that I was so happy to hear that and I am willing to support him every step of the way. He said that being in a relationship with me has been on his mind ever since our conversation last month.  What sealed the deal was when I was there with him through the thick and thin.\n\nLater that evening, I told him that he was special to me, and told him why (because he asked me to hahaha). Right after, to my utter shock,  he said \"I love you, a_big_fool\" to me. I was not expecting to hear those words from him for a very long time to come, but it felt so good.\n\nThank you all for your advice and encouragement.\nTL;DR:"}

He was a real piece of dirt, like the kind of possessive asshole you find in those romantic films where they're engaged and you don't know why. It reached a point where he essentially told her not to talk to me or her other male friends and, wanting her to be happy (she was happy with him), I stopped talking to her.\n\nWe hadn't spoken in about a year until she broke up with him, then things kinda shifted back to how they were before. It was almost effortless how quickly our friendship just went back to what it was, but that's what I'd always liked about her, everything just felt so natural. The only thing that was different is that she was now not a virgin and I still was so that was kind of awkward, but it was no big deal.\n\nThen, about two months ago we were both at a big 'end of school' house party thing and we'd had something to drink and we just kinda made out. It wasn't too awkward and we laughed about it and things went back to being just friendly. The other night we were on skype and somehow the topic turned to sex and she asked whether I could separate sex from feelings. I thought 'yeah' because who can't.\n\nShe came round on Sunday and we had sex and it was great, but we were both very clear that it wasn't something to lead to a relationship and that it was just a one time thing. \n\nThe problem is I can't stop thinking about everything that happened and, when I do, it feels like there's a weight on my heart. I don't want to bring it up with her because I feel like it's just going to ruin the friendship that I've only just gotten back. She's going through some stuff with her own family regarding terminal illness and I don't want to interrupt what she's dealing with. How can I stop thinking about it, how can I stop feeling things and how can I get laid again?\nTL;DR:"}

After about four months of building up courage, I finally told him that I feel more than friendship towards him.

I spend the next several days believing that I do not love her at all, and am merely afraid of leaving her/loneliness, etc. I have no idea during those items if I have ever felt true love or just silly highschool love. No matter how many times this occurs, I believe whatever state I am in to be accurate. The problem is, I genuinely do not know which to be true.

But I find that halfway through my school day (I'm in high-school) my crotch starts to smell and I don't know what to do.\n\nI am somewhat active before the smell starts, so that might be it (sweat). I have tried putting deodorant on my legs near my underwear which helps a little. I found that wear boxer briefs instead of the type of boxers I normally wear helps reduce the smell tenfold. The only problem why I wear boxer briefs to school is that over the day they stretch out, and then ride up my leg making it feel like I'm wearing nothing. I really just want to know how to get rid of bad crotch smell.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, what kind of underwear can you reccommend for someone of a larger size (i.e. someone fat whose crack goes up 3 inches higher than most people). When I wear boxers, they ride down and don't fit very well. When I wear boxer briefs, they ride up and stretch out making them uncomfortable for long periods of time. I would really like to know what kind of underwear that works. Preferably on the cheap side please. I will not try briefs. They will make me chafe like a Motha****.\nTL;DR:"}

My extensive base of knowledge? I can tell you everything I'm learning in class. And that's about it. Because that's the only thing I do regularly. (But, for full disclosure, I'm just healing from a 7-year bout with an eating disorder and unproductive thoughts about my body, plastic surgery, and relationships with myself and people took up the majority of my brainwaves during that time period. I'm coming out of it realizing that my eating disorder WAS my hobby, and I have nothing else in my life to rest upon, so I just kinda picked up journalism and ran with that even though I like music better). \n\nAnyone else feel like the only thing they're good at is thinking, because they've never had something that's their 'thing?' Or, if they have a 'thing,' they lost it and/or never had the fundamentals necessary to really understand it (I don't know music theory and kind of just had an awesome voice and didn't need to learn much or push myself)? \n\nHoping this makes sense.\nTL;DR:"}

Help? Advice? More details inside.\nPOST: Here's the story. \n\nI have a 12 month lease. The lease says \"The term rent shall be $7,200, payable except herein otherwise provided, in installments of $900, on the 1st day of every month, in advance, so long as the lease is in effect.\" I signed this lease almost a year ago.\n\nLater on in the lease $7,200 is again (hand written in) listed as the term rent. The above quoted bit is all typed out on the front page of the lease.\n\nMy dad/lawyer looked over the lease in September, after I had already signed and moved in and all. I just thought it would be good to have him look it over, even if it was a little after the fact. He is the one who noticed the discrepancy. What they SHOULD have filled in was $10,800 instead of $7,200.\n\nHere I am, 8 payments of $900 later, fully paid the $7,200 my lease says that I owe.\n\nI got the call today, granted, I was expecting it. I very calmly spoke to the manager of the management company that runs my building and handles all of this fun stuff. He was basically trying to bully me into paying, threatening to get the paperwork rolling with their lawyer if I don't pay up.\n\nWhat do I do? I live in Boston, does anyone have and experience with this? Any precedent set that I can refer to?  And I know, lawyer up, like I said my dad is a lawyer, the only problem is he lives pretty far away and does not have any kind of jurisdiction in Massachusetts. He's great for advisement but I don't think he can do anything for me from where he stands.\n\nThank you in advance.

I live with my mom, my brother, and my sister in a tiny apartment. I sleep in the living room, brother in one room and mom and sis in another. I get woken up by people needing to get food or drinks or go out the front door because the living room, dining room and kitchen are all pretty much one open room. While my brother does take into consideration that a bright light will wake me and uses the light above the stove to avoid it, he tends to leave it on. This always ends up waking me and then I have to get up and turn it off. Once I get up it is very hard to go back to sleep. I've talked to him about it, along with various other things, yet nothing happens. He still makes messes, not cleaning up, spilling e-cig juice on my pillows and blankets, leaving his hoodies and socks where I sleep, eating and leaving crumbs where I sleep and so on.\n\nI had enough this time. I unscrewed the stove light bulb and went into his room and turned the extremely mild hanging light on in his room. I didn't turn on the super bright one. I knew that it wouldn't wake him immediately. About half an hour later he wakes up pissed off. I shrugged. I will continue to turn that light on until he learns to turn the other light off.\nTL;DR:"}

We were very close, we clicked on alot of topics and she was pretty much my best friend. But I think we work much better as friends than in a relationship. We had lots of fights and I considered breaking up with her on several occasions but couldn't because we had grown so attached that we isolated many of our other friends.

The house I sold was purchased for 170k, sold for 212k will have about 40k cash after the transaction. My other house, I have rented out making $1,100 a month and the mortgage is about $950. It was purchased for 123k, I still owe about 110k on it. I have a 2013 F150 which I still owe about 20k on however the loan is 0%. The payment on it is about $650 a month. I have federal student loans that total about 10k at 6.8%, 4.something% and 3.5%. \n\nMy salary is 95k /year which after taxes, insurance, 401k, stock purchase program ends up being about $4,400 /month. My 401k is valued at about 15k. And probably only about 5k in my bank account. No other debts or anything other than what I have mentioned here. \n\nMy question is, what should my next move be? I am thinking I take 10k out of what I make off the house and pay off my student loans since those have interest. This leaves me with about 30k. What should I do with this money? I am not interested in buying another house for myself for at least a couple years so I am fine with renting an apartment. Ultimately I would like to be able to buy a 300k house with 20% down as my family house, however I am pretty far from that. So my biggest question is, what is the smartest thing I can do with 30k to help me get closer to that goal? I have thought about buying another rental property, a townhouse for 100k with 20% down, to build wealth however, the most idealistic return I can see is a profit of 2,500-4k a year on it. This would also leave me with another mortgage and make it harder to buy a house for myself if I needed one.

The doctors figured it had been there for a few years because it was large enough where the doctors thought my heel would collapse in the near future becuase the bone was \"as thin as an eggshell\" after which I probably have had to undergo massive reconstruction surgeries and probably would have never walked normally again.\n\nFast forward a few months, they put a big needle in my heel, sucked out the stuff that makes a cyst a cyst and injected my heel with someone elses bone marrow or something to make the bone grow.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?

It's just annoying to have to deal with another guy like that.\nTL;DR:"}

Dealing in Stolen Property\n* 2. Defrauding a Pawn Broker\n* 3. Grand Theft\n* 4. Petty Theft ( I violated my initial probation for this with new theft charges so I was adjudicated guilty for this charge.) \n\nI have no other charges other than these. I have a valid driver's license as well. I'm 25 right now and my last arrest was in June 2013. Once again the adjudication was withheld on the felonies and some of the charges were even completely dropped/abandoned by the state attorney. I'm in Florida as well and for those who do not know, Florida is a right to work state where the employer can fire you for any reason they want. I was offered the position on Monday and I start tomorrow at 9 am. Both of my future bosses chose to hire me over 25+ other applicants and both seemed to really like me and told me I was exactly who they were looking for to join the company. I am completely nervous about having my offer rescinded when this background check reveals my arrest record, but it's not like I robbed a bank, raped someone, or has multiple DUI's and a suspended/revoked driver's license. Am I over thinking panicking for no reason or should I count on having this offer rescinded? Please do not troll me on this topic because I have tried so fucking hard to find a job over the past year and I just finally found a career worthy one and I really want solid, good advice on what to do right now. They are rapidly expanding and have told me that more than likely I will be offered my own company site out west and I will be relocated at no expense to me.( I get the fuck out of Florida, THANK GOD.) So Reddit please tell me how I approach this when I'm asked about it by my boss. This job already means the world to me and I haven't even started yet. Thank you guys.\nTL;DR:"}

He's going out with his friend the day I leave to some bar and has told me that the night is going to be \"legendary\"  and won't tell me what he is doing other than \"guy things\" and getting really drunk. Obviously this all pisses me off on its own... \n\nHe's asked me not to text him at all while he's doing this. I think that's unfair because if he's going to be doing stupid shit like it seems, I feel like I should be able to check on him and make sure he's still alive and made it home safe, etc. Not calling or anything, just checking in, as I usually do when he goes out. He always gets so mad when I do this though, but I just worry when he doesn't answer for like 8 hours and I haven't heard a thing from him. I don't think my request is unreasonable, especially when I said that I don't expect answers right away, just a text or two a night. \n\nAnyways, now he said that he understands this is wrong, but given that I've been upset with him for doing this a couple times in the past, he will just turn the phone off all night. I'll admit, early in our relationship I was too clingy and was kind of bitchy and annoying with him being out, but I've seen my errors and corrected them, only texting maybe twice to ask what they're up to or if he needs a ride. \n\nI don't know if I'm wrong here or if he is, so I would appreciate any other opinions.\nTL;DR:"}

What should we do?\nPOST: My mom drives a 2004 Honda Odyssey which has been having some transmission problems for the past 6 months. She had been taking it in for regular maintenance at a local (Austin, Texas) auto mechanic shop for about 3 years and went to them for transmission help. The mechanic attempted to fix it numerous times before ordering or building (not entirely sure) some part for which he had provided a guarantee/warranty for. \n\nAbout a few weeks after this repair, the transmission problem came back with a vengeance. She returned to the mechanics for the repair as it was under some sort of warranty and found that the mechanic that was assisting her had passed away. The owner had no record of any repairs for her transmission for these past months as the mechanic had been pocketing her money (turns out she wasn't the only one, too).  After returning with receipts and the warranty, the owner offered to take her car into a Honda dealership (on their dime) to see what part they needed to order to fix her car.\n\nThe owner ordered the part and told my mom it would take about a week to arrive. I do not believe she has any documentation that they would be repairing her car after receiving said part. \n\nTwo weeks pass and the owner had not returned any of her calls.

I've been trying to climb the restaurant ladder for about a year at that time the traditional way (start as a dishwasher and learn hands-on). I had already learned a lot, and also being a bit of a narcissist prick, I loved to show off my new-found culinary chops to my layman friends. \n\nSo we had planned a barbecue one night and I had been drinking a fair amount. Eager to assert my perceived mastery of the kitchen, I offered (i.e. demanded) to be allowed to prepare the whole spread. My friends agreed. And so, I self-styled master chef, set to work. I began with the mashed potatoes first; dicing each spud into easy to boil cubes. This procedure had the additional benefit of showing off what I thought were my ninja-like knife skills. I began to carry on a conversation with one of my buddies (who was in another room) and began to focus less on the razor-sharp hunk of steel I was irresponsibly wielding. Until I felt a sharp pain shoot up from my left thumb. Apparently while talking, I continued dicing and had added the tip of the digit to the potatoes for that extra kick. The cutting board was covered in an astounding amount of Jack Daniels ridden blood, and there on the board was the piece of the thumb, complete with a tiny clipping of the nail. SHIT. I mopped the blood up the best I could and slipped into the bathroom to patch myself up. I left the thumb-tip on the cutting board. \n\nBy the time I staunched the bleeding, I found that someone had finished cooking for me. The alienated piece of flesh was no where to be found. Later on, however, somebody did encounter the nail clipping in the potatoes...\nTL;DR:"}

The bill comes in my name, so my roommate has to pay me for his half. I don't like having to ask for money from people, but he makes me ask him for the rent every single month, and I often have to ask several times.\n\nI always make it really clear when rent is due. I put the bill right on the kitchen counter where it's impossible to miss. I'll casually mention it's coming up. After it's due and he inevitably hasn't paid, I'll say, \"hey dude, rent was due yesterday.\" And his response is always like, \"oh, ok, I'll pay you back.\" Some time will pass, he will pay nothing, and I'll have to ask again. So far, the only way I end up getting money from him is asking him to literally write the check, on the spot, so I can immediately take it to my bank.\n\nWhat should I do? Or is this something not worth being annoyed by? He always pays... he just makes me ask multiple times. I'm sick of having to ask so many times. At any given moment, he's often somewhere from $1k to $2k in debt to me, depending on how many bills he hasn't paid me for yet.\n\nAlso, to be clear, there's no issue at all about him actually having the money. He makes a shit ton of money (we both do) and doesn't spend it on anything. He carelessly leaves his bank statements around as well, so I actually know his life savings and random crap that I shouldn't know. He just has this bad habit of not paying until asked, usually several times.\nTL;DR:"}

From the beginning she revealed how attracted to me she was and how much she liked talking to me. I also enjoy talking to her and she's quite attractive. Seemed like it could be a fun thing for awhile at least. We even setup a second date this weekend, no problems up until that point.

Looking forward to seeing you!\" etc etc.\n\nBut this week I told her that I didn't drive or have a car and she pretty much slowed down the texts to a crawl but not canceling the date. I asked if she wanted to go to a certain restaurant and she said \"Let's keep it casual and get drinks.\" I haven't yet told her that the reason I don't have a car is because I was in an accident and felt that I was going to die, so I stopped driving for awhile and eventually felt it just worked better for me not to drive.\n\nThe thing is, I kind of just want to cancel the date. If she's already pulling away, I don't want to waste my time and go on an awkward date. It's not a big deal either because it's only been two weeks and one date (even if we did sleep together) but it's just really bugging me. I feel offended. Am I overreacting though?

In her post, she mentioned she was in a long term relationship but that her significant other was cool with her having casual relationships with other people. Although I'd have preferred someone unattached, her interests lined up with mine and so I messaged. \n\nLong story short, the conversation turned to dirty chatting and eventually video calling where we both stripped down. She wanted to meet up but I've been busy until this weekend. Being bored after work, I decided to see if I could find her on FB (she didn't give a last name) and when I did I discovered her \"long term\" relationship meant marriage. This was quite surprising since I asked her point blank if she was married and she said \"just in a long term\". \n\nComing from a religious background (now dropped) with strong morals, I am ambivalent about hooking up with a married girl. I'm actually cool with it as long as her husband is but it still seems like a line is getting crossed. Moreover, I don't have experience in the sack (she's cool with this) which ups the nerves. \n\nAnyway, we've been texting and she is making it very clear that she wants to have sex with me when she visits town this weekend. Being clear means saying things like \"can't wait to undress you\" and \"we'll be going back to your place so soon\". So I'm really torn as I want to end my virginity so badly but her being married throws me off. \n\nGranted most of you aren't virgins, but how does the whole situation sound?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [22 M/F] of 1.5 years, she is changing a bit; How do I cope?\nPOST: So my girl and I have been together a year and a half. Honestly, we've never had a fight. Ever. Not once. If there's ever been even a slight disagreement, we've had a discussion and come to a conclusion.\n\nAs of late though her life has changed a lot. Her dream career path came to a crushing close, she's going back to school for something else at a different university, meanwhile I'm also going back to school for a trade program, we both work full-time so time together is scarce. With all the stress, she wanted a pet bunny. I bought it for her. Three days later my throat closed I was so allergic to the thing. I got a test done and it turns out I'm allergic to just about all fuzzy pets.\n\nSo without a pet, now today she wants a back tattoo of wings and to dye her hair blue. This is entirely out of nowhere, she's always drawn wings and angels and whatnot in notebooks. She's also got a bit of an artsy side where she writes poetry. But she's never once given the impression she wants tats and alternative color hair. She's always been a blonde with a bubbly jokey personality, but since the stress hit I've seen that change into a bit more serious and somewhat pessimistic personality.\n\nSo this led to our first fight. We fought back and forth from about 5pm until 10pm on the issue, and it ended with me telling her that it is her body and to do what she wants. The issue resolved bittersweet because I know she can tell I am not happy with the change, but I want her to be happy.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: Mixed feelings about giving up a German shepherd\nPOST: My girlfriend and I adopted a German shepherd together about 1 year ago. We got him from a family that had taken him out a neglectful/abusive situation. He wasn't getting along with the new farm animals so they put him up for adoption on Craigslist. According to this family, he was malnourished and hid behind their couch for over 3 weeks. They thought he was around 6 months to 1 year old, which makes him about 2 years old now. \n\nHe was terrified of everything when we got him, but he has come a very long way in terms of progress. We treated his heart worm, got all of his shots, and had him neutered. He started playing with us and actually acting like a puppy. His behavior has improved dramatically, however, he has nipped/bit two people. He didn't draw blood but they were certainly tense situations. \n\nMy girlfriend has an anxiety disorder that the dog picks up on very quickly and he starts crying, whining, guarding and barking whenever he senses that she is anxious. We have been considering giving him up for some time and we just met recently with a GSD rescue who might be able to take him. \n\nAs far as training has gone, we've met with multiple different trainers that have given us some conflicting advice. We've taken a scared dog class that he did well in, but it's different outside of the classroom. \n\nBasically, I have a couple questions/thoughts:\n\n1) Will a dog that is this anxious be able to adjust to a fourth home?\n\n2) Will he be able to trust other people again or will he feel that we abandoned him?\n\n3) Is his situation going to improve or might he be worse off after leaving us?\n\nOverall I'm just unsure about keeping him or giving him to a more experienced owner. I do want what is best for him, but I'm not sure what that is. We do live in a city with a high crime rate, and it's nice to feel safe with him in our house. However, it is also very stressful not knowing if he will react aggressively around our friends and family. \n\nThank you for any help or similar stories.\nTL;DR:"}

I'd love to hear them!\nPOST: Here's mine:\n\nToday I was at the dog park doing my homework in the corner. Whenever I heard dogs fighting I'd look up to make sure my dog was ok. Everytime there was a fight my dog was in the middle of it which was really disappointing and shocking. \n\nAfter a while I realized the other dog owners never shooed my dog away or yelled directly at her. Then one time I got to see a fight beginning to unfold. As soon as the two dogs were starting to growl and bark in a serious manner my dog rushed toward them and wedged herself between them, shoving them off of each other. Then when they were separated she would bark loudly right in their faces which, though they'd just been fighting, they took like shameful children.\n\nSoon enough, I realized my dog was only in the middle of these fights because she was trying to break them up. She probably was the only one that could break them up too, since the owners couldn't truly get involved like she could.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by riding a razor scooter barefoot down a hill\nPOST: This happened about 10 years ago when I was 14 or so. I was visiting my grandparents in Atlanta and they live at the end of cul-de-sac at the bottom of a hill. It's a fairly steep, winding hill that cars seldom drive down. There are only 4 houses on the whole street. \n\nI was riding a razor scooter around barefoot when my uncle and I thought it would be fun to ride from the top of the hill down. Bear in mind that this is something I did often, however never barefoot.\n\nI walked to the top of the hill and began to cruise down the hill in a crouched position, building up as much speed as I could. (yeah, total daredevil, I know) At the midpoint of the hill I recognized that I was going too fast. The trees were whipping by in a blur. Instinctively, I pushed my bare heel down on the metal brake. The brake works by creating friction by pressing the metal against the spinning wheel. The friction rapidly heated the metal brake up to an unbearable temperature and it burned my heel. I cried out in pain and the panic set in. \n\nI couldn't stop because the brake was too hot, and I was moving too fast to simply hop off. I aimed for my grandparents' grass in their yard, but I would have to hop the curb to make it. I jumped at the right time and landed on the grass, but unfortunately it was muddy. The scooter's front wheel plunged into the mud and abruptly stopped. Thanks to newton's laws of motion, I was flung over the handlebars face first into the mud. I picked myself up, dripping with mud, when the pain really set in. \n\nI looked at the bottom of my heel and the sight of it made me start crying. (I was 14, so still not much of an excuse!) The skin was blistered and peeling. I ended up with a second degree burn on the bottom of my foot that took weeks to heal. Walking was a painful endeavour.\nTL;DR:"}

So that means the lady behind us had to wait until we finished ordering. We will call her the \"land whale\". \n\nJust as we were finishing ordering, she honked at us. Yes. Honked.

Oh boy, Adrenaline coming! I push the middle of my steering wheel and let loose the longest honk probably ever. A good 1-2 minutes sounds right. We stopped when she GOT OUT OF HER CAR and started SWEARING AT US LIKE MALCOLM TUCKER ON WEDNESDAY. I swiftly backed up drove back in line, paid for my food and gave her the finger driving away.

We always talked and spent time hanging out.

They eventually moved in together, and I was happy for him. I thought we had both moved on and that life would go on normally.

When it started we were all lovey dovey and couldn't get enough of eachother for a good few months, then I messed up and we fell out but quickly got back together again, we argue a lot but love eachother, as friends and more and these arguments are usually over her getting upset by silly things.\n\nWe've tried being together but we both change and decided that it would be better to stay as we were. Over the two years, she's went off with multiple people (we've stopped for the time) and then whenever something went wrong with those I was there for her and took her back. This year it started to go a bit downhill, I suppose we were both bored and needed something different and broke up not long after our 2 year anniversary while still staying as best friends.\n\nA couple of weeks later she got a new boyfriend and started to spend all her time with him and I got upset and told her about how I felt, she got mad and we argued but then sorted it out. I must have seen her 3/4 times (including our anniversary) over a month or two (we used to see eachother almost everyday). With her encouragement I started talking to another girl to try and get over her (the other girl has a boyfriend already and I'm not interested in her in a romantic way).\n\nThe night I started speaking to her my friend seemed a bit off with me and I repeatedly asked what was wrong for her to tell me nothing, I knew there was but decided to leave it, I tried to speak to her but because of how she was being there wasn't much conversation. Later that night she asked if I was still talking to the new girl and I was so I told her, she then got mad and accused me of leaving her out and has been like this ever since and is just getting worse, she's even told me I can't talk to her if I'm still talking to the other girl. I still want a friendship with her while continuing to talk to the other girl. What can I do to get her to realise she's not being fair?\nTL;DR:"}

We bolt out of there and head home excited to setup all the new stuffs. \n\nWell, upon getting home I realize that Moe's has caught up with me but it's late and I'm tired and the new, heavy d\u00e9cor piece is supposed to go into the bath room that I was about to use. So, not wanting to face the prospect of hanging the d\u00e9cor in the aftermath of a Moe's poo, I rush to get the wall thing out of the box and on the wall. I grab my tool bag and start in on the box. Now, this thing is heavy so it is strapped to the package using some 1/2\" thick industrial strength zip ties. The flimsy pair of scissors in my bag just couldn't cut it so I got out my 3\" pocket knife to finish the job. I slid my knife under the first tie and rotate the blade up and pulled as hard as I could. Turns out the zip ties were no match for my knife as it instantly snapped which caused my knife to plant squarely in the palm of my left hand, almost cutting my thumb off.  \n\nSo, my wife trucked me to the ER where I got 11 stitches.

We both know very few people here, but have a few people we know from back in the day that we've hung out with, though rarely because we're not that close to them. On his side is a few girls that he knew before we got together. A little back story we've been insanely close friends for 7 years before we dated and only got together in the last 6th months because we were dealing with careers, graduate degrees etc that made it impossible (we both agreed long distance would ruin any future for us). So this group of girls, we've seen only twice and I don't think he's gone behind my back or anything to see them. One of them will periodically text me about getting together for drinks. The problem is, he has slept with her in the past and he lied to be about it when I asked him before we even met up with these girls for the first time. I know for a 100 percent no doubt act that they hooked up (don't ask how, long story and it doesn't really matter). Anyway I don't know what to do...if I confront him with it I have to reveal some things that I don't want to and break another persons trust, but it is seriously making me not trust him.

We're currently long distance but that hasn't really proven to be much of an issue. Basically, he's always been an extremely quiet person and isn't in to talking that much. This really threw me off at the beginning of our relationship, I thought he was always mad or bored with me or something. I found myself holding back telling him things so we'd have something to talk about when we were together. \n\nEventually I guess I got used to it? It was certainly never happy about it but I guess I was just like 'whatever I don't have to deal with this now maybe he'll change or some shit'. He hasn't. \n\nSo we'll go to bars some times and he basically won't say anything the whole time, and I'll ask him how he is and he just responds with \"Fine, how are you?\" like it was some sort of greeting or some shit. Like I'm actually asking him how he is, why is this hard for him? And recently his brother passed away and he really has barely talked about it, and I try not to pressure him because obvs this is a really personal thing that I have no experience of. It's not like he's a stupid person or something--he definitely is thinking about things, he just never articulates them. It's making being with him progressively more difficult--it's very hard to be with someone when you can't support them (because you don't know what they need), they won't tell you what's going on in their life, and honestly I don't enjoy hanging out in silence. \n\nSo I guess have multiple questions: Why doesn't he talk? Am I ever going to get through to him or should I break up with him? Is there anything I can do to understand what's going on with him? I really love him and we have a lot in common but having a meaningful convo can be like pulling teeth, and sometimes it's like dating a fucking wall.\nTL;DR:"}

We have talked about it and we are (were) going to put both up for sale and buy a home together by the Fall.\n\nWe get along well, are sexually compatible, have fun.  I cannot explain this but I just know I don't want to be with her anymore.  For no good reason.  I just suddenly had a change of heart.  I'm 34 and I don't want kids (neither does she) but I also don't want to imagine only being with her for the next 50 years or so.\n\nShe's sweet.  She tries to please me.  She is getting set to cook a big Easter dinner for my family at my place on the weekend.  She's made Easter baskets for my nephews.  She loves my cat and always buys it treats.  She's wonderful.  But I don't want to be with her anymore and I now feel like I'm living a charade.  I don't want to have sex with her anymore and I sure don't want to eat Easter dinner with her.\n\nThis makes me feel like an evil person.  She's going to be heartbroken.  She's so excited about us and our relationship and the fact that we'll be getting \"OUR\" place soon.  She is always baking me cakes and sending me little texts.  I want to date and screw around, and yes I know I'm already in my 30s but I'm not ready or interested in this anymore.\n\nHow do I do this?  Do I just sit her down and tell her and then go no contact?  I'm a bit scared that will terrify her.  I'm really her rock in this world.  I can't even imagine doing that honestly.  It feels so fucking cold.  But I also know she will cry and beg and want to discuss it forever.  Help.\nTL;DR:"}

When we met he could have been considered a chunky guy, not really overweight, but at the wider end of normal BMI. \n\nDuring the first year, he went through a tough phase in life and he gained a bit of weight. I never said anything about it, because honestly I did not think it mattered. The tough phase ended, but his eating habits did not. \n\nI have not asked him, because I am afraid of hurting his feelings, but I am sure that right now he would be either considered obese or really overweight.\n\nEven though he can afford eating good food, whenever I come over I see wrappers of cup noodles and fast food lying around. I don't consider him being lazy, so I cant really explain this kind of behavior.\n\nHe himself does not feel good about his body, yet he is making no real effort in changing it. Right now it is starting to affect our sex life because he will leave his shirt on most of the time.\n\nI don't know how to approach this issue. I love him very much, but it is hard to see his self loathing and I cant understand why he is not taking control of his eating habits.\n\nWhat are your suggestions?

What do I do..?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I, who met through mutual friends, have been dating about 1 year now. About 6 months ago, we broke up for various reasons.\n\nThe breakup was definite. It wasn't just \"time off\" or \"we'll think about it.\" We both had decided it was time to end.\n\nSome mean things were said on both of our accounts, but he told me he didn't really love me, and had just said it to keep the peace.\n\nWe didn't talk after that.\n\nIn that time, I was very hurt because I did love him. I suppose I went on the rebound, and had (protected) sex with two different guys. Each guy it was only once and I have never spoken to them since. I didn't know either of them very well.\n\nI freaked out and went and got tested a couple weeks later. I'm okay. \n\nAbout a month later, my ex and I got in contact again. Long story short, we worked things out and now have been dating again without incident.\n\nWhen he asked if I had done anything with anyone while we were broken up, I told him no. In my defense, it meant nothing with those guys. I don't care about them in any way. I knew telling him the truth would only put an unnecessary wall between our relationship that was already being mended. I would not want to know if he did things with other girls, because I know that we were broken up, it wasn't cheating, and I'd rather not dwell on that information.\n\nDid I do the right thing? Some days I feel entirely justified in what I did. We were broken up and I truly never expected us to get back together. Some days I feel very guilty, but I know telling him now wouldn't help anything, and I wouldn't be doing it to make things right, but rather to extinguish my guilty conscience.\nTL;DR:"}

Her last relationship got done in December, after a two year relationship (she was dumped by him), and according to some of the things she's posted on her tumblr account she's having trouble getting over it. She's admitted her previous boyfriend was a bit of a dick, but I've seen her post that she worries about what he's doing now with other girls, sometimes seems depressed posting about it.\n\nIn the time I've hung out with her, she hasn't been depressed, she's been very happy, and wants me to hang out with her sometime this week to watch Firefly (one of my favorite shows). I plan to hang out with her probably Wednesday or later this week.\n\nHere's my simple question: What should I keep in mind with this possible \"still getting over him\" situation, should I be concerned about it, or just keep moving forward in my own way and not let it affect me?

Part of her compensation includes medical/dental/vision benefits and school teacher's retirement through the state (state pension).\n\n* Like any other job, her paychecks are of course **deducted tax** (state and fed). In addition, each paycheck is **deducted union dues**  (enrollment into union is optional), **deducted the cost of enrolled benefits** (enrollment into benefits is optional) and **deducted her share towards CalSTRS**  (state pension for school teachers). All normal and expected. \n\n* However, in addition to these deductions, she's also being charged a considerable % of her paycheck towards the district's *'Employee Retirement Trust'** (*MANDATORY*). Note, she already pays towards a retirement fund through the state.\n\nI'm curious to see what you think about a fund that every district employee is required to pay into. Personally, I find it fishy that employee contribution into personal retirement fund and medical/dental/vision benefits is optional, yet this 'trust' is forced on everybody. \n\n* This account is specifically for the district and **does not follow**  the teacher if they leave. \n\nYoung teachers especially seem disadvantaged because the unlikeness that you'll remain at one district until you retire. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any insight or knowledge.\nTL;DR:"}

He got a discount to go to university in our home town, so we agreed that long distance was the best option. So we have been long distance for a total of two years. These two years have been plagued by the single problem of communication. He hates technology to the point that he probably wouldn't have Internet if he didn't need it for school, so he obviously doesn't have a web cam or a phone with face time capability, leaving talking on the phone or texting as our only real communication options. \n\nOver these two years we have had multiple fights over him never calling or, when he does call, only wanting to stay on the phone for a few minutes. The culmination of these fights is that he wants me to text him and remind him and to tell him when I want to talk longer. This seems like a fine compromise, but now he treats talking to me like an immense chore. He rushes conversations, starts talking to other people, or makes up excuses about why he doesn't want to stay on the phone. He says that he just hates talking on the phone because \"it isn't personal\" or \"It's uncomfortable to carry it around against my head\"  but if I suggest him buying a Web cam, he will agree but never get around to doing it. \n\nAfter two years of this, it just makes me feel like I have no priority and that I'm not interesting enough to want to talk to. But every time I go home for breaks things go amazingly with no communication problems and this makes me so confused as to whether I should make a problem we only have when I'm gone a deal breaker. \n\nSo my question is, should I just give up the nagging and wait it out until I get home from school, or is this a problem big enough to bring a break up over?\nTL;DR:"}

I think she may be interested in me too, but we are both super busy in grad school and basically see each other when we're both out with a larger group of friends/classmates.  We have great chemistry and are both fun, attractive, single people.\n\nI picked up on something has been happening for a while now - she is one of those girls who hugs a lot of people so this is a source of confusion, but any time she enters she seems to make it a point to greet/hug me last out of the other people I'm with.  When she says goodbye is even more noticeable.  The past 3 or 4 times we've all been out she seems to first tell everyone else she's leaving then give me the final hug / goodbye.  \n\nAlso, she seems to ask me at times to take an Uber with her, or occasionally we give each other rides (just us two)... but I get mixed signals here.  One time I tried walking her to her car in a very seedy area of town and she didn't want me to at first but was fine with it (ended up walking with her up to 50 feet from her car).  Another time I said I would leave the bar where our other friends were to share an uber with her to get to our cars, but she did not want this.  Yet, two days ago, she asked me to share an uber with just her to get back in the same exact situation.  Very confusing to me.    \n\nI don't know what any of this means, if anything.  But it's certainly a pattern and something I have noticed.  Thanks for any insight.\nTL;DR:"}

In a couple cases, they got busy. While they did have more on ther plates, the reasons for their busyness (e.g. classes starting) didn't keep them from hanging out before.

I understand hanging out less often, but they would stop initiating contact or not ask to spend time together months after getting busy. \n\nI would love to date, but can't because of my family/their culture. So sex is the most intimate thing I can offer. Some wanted more and moved on when they met someone, but others weren't interested. Is this all I can reasonably expect?\nTL;DR:"}

It's not even on my radar.\nPOST: I feel like my girlfriend and I have a pretty good thing going on. We get along great. The only the we fight about is marriage. And lately these fights are coming up more and more frequently to the point where it's putting a real strain on the relationship and has me flirting with the idea of ending it.\n\nHere's pretty much the timeline:\n\n* Two years ago we meet and hit it off\n* Almost year after we meet, she gets a job in a new city, tells me she loves me, asks me to come with\n* I was ready to try a new city and I valued our relationship, so I moved in with her 3 months after she left\n* After only a handful of months of living together she brings up marriage for the first time. \n\nI tell her I'm not even thinking about marriage. I may want it some day but I can't guarantee that I will. Everytime she brings up marriage I try my best to make it abundantly clear that I love her and value our relationship. And I feel like I'm truly not ready for marriage and don't have a timeline and when or if I will be.\n\nShe seems to take great offense as to how I feel. She thinks she's not good enough for me. I believe she's really self-conscious when this is truly a \"it's not you, it's me\" situation. She also feels there's no point to us even dating if marriage isn't the end goal.\n\nMy GF also brings up the point as to why I would move in with her if I wasn't barking up the marriage tree. Which makes me feel kind of stupid. I totally understand moving in is \"advancing\" the relationship considerably but it doesn't make me think of marriage. \n\nI also really feel for her as her friends are from a small town and are all getting married. So of course they are all asking her when it'll be her turn. As a guy I feel fortunate I don't get nearly half the amount of pressure as she does.

We both go to the same university, which is how/where we met, and started dating towards the middle of 2nd semester. Everything was great during that time, we always hung out, talked, went on dates, the usual.\n\nWhen summer came she was going back to her hometown, about 5 hours away, while I was staying at the university. Neither of us were too concerned about the distance we would have because it was only going to be for two and a half months. And at first things were just fine, we talked every day and were making plans to visit each other over the summer. \n\nI never had the chance to visit her, but she came back one weekend and visited me. Leading up to said weekend I was excited to see her again but when she got here something felt off. It didn't feel like our normal relationship anymore, we both seemed a little distant towards each other.\n\nAfter she left things stayed the same, we stopped really talking anymore. Maybe a text or two once a week at most. She came back for the summer a few days ago and I was again excited to see her and we planned to go out to dinner when I was done working, but when I did see her, she didn't seem to really care and told me she had already eaten and didn't want to go to dinner. I feel like in a normal relationship, and call me out if I'm being crazy for it, both people would be excited to see the other and show it to them. She just sort of seemed like, \"oh you're here, cool.\"\n\nNow we're a few days past her coming back and she hasn't really made an effort to get together and she leaves at the end of the week for 10 days before classes start. I could just be overreacting but I wanted to get some feed back.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dogs\nTITLE: Dog aggression questions\nPOST: Hi Reddit, \n\nMy wife and I just (today) rescued a 10-month old lab/beagle mix who is showing unusual behavior we were hoping we could get some insight on.\n\nWe previously had a lab who passed away about a month ago who had aggression issues with other dogs (kill or be killed mentality) and we fear somehow re-creating those habits with this dog. \n\nAbout the rescue: The humane society said they found her with a jug over her head (as though they caught her in the middle of fetching something out of it or someone put it on her head).  She's very timid around males, so we know there was some abuse. Whenever I raise my hand, she cowers. The trainer there told us that she's very submissive to other dogs, and we saw this for ourselves tonight, but then she did something that surprised us.\n\nWe brought her over to a friend's house who has a beagle. When they met in the front yard (both loose-leashed) our dog rolled over on her belly to submit to the beagle.  We then went inside and they got along, sniffing each other, licking etc. Our friend then brought out treats to reward them, and the friend's dog ate his and approached our dog (not to steal her treat but to play).  Our dog snapped at him, so we corrected her.  She didn't seem interested in the treat so we took it away so it was no longer an issue. \n\nFrom that point on, she was not friendly with our friend's beagle.  Snapping at him once, showing teeth when he got close in another situation.  She stayed away from him for the rest of the night, as did he (our friend's dog) since he was scared. \n\nSo my questions: By our taking the treat away, did our dog think the beagle took it and  then she had it out for him?  Has anyone seen this behavior before?  How would you go about correcting this?\nTL;DR:"}

Of course, I didn't use the hand I was casually sticking out the window - nahhh. The one hand holding my ice cream smacked right into my face, sending my glasses flying right out of the window.\n\nI couldn't fathom what just happened for a few seconds. And to make it even worse, as the ice cream was dripping down I saw the remnants of a butterfly, still covered in icey goo and twitching its broken wings as it lived its final moments.

To reach out or not to reach out?\nPOST: As a disclaimer I'd like to start by saying that I'm not currently seeking a relationship with this girl, as she has had a boyfriend for the duration of our break up, which is kind of the reason we fell out in the first place. For some background: She lied to me, and we were both extremely immature about the situation.. I got worked up and angry, and she just no longer wanted anything to do with me out of the blue. It ended very badly, with me quoting her exact words from not two days before she hooked up with her current boyfriend (\"My depression has got to the point where I need medication, and my doctor at home is the only one I trust with my diagnosis.\" and \"Can you please stay longer and just hold me?\" and so on..) and calling her \"a selfish, lying, manipulative cunt.\" \n\n---\n\nNow, there was another reason behind that outbreak of anger: We both have HPV and she believes she got it from me, and I know that I got it from her. I spent 2 1/2 years being single, the girls at my previous school had mandatory jabs for HPV when they turned 15. She, on the other hand, never had the jab, and slept around a lot before we were an item. \n\n---\n\nMy problem is this: I can't stop seeing her everywhere. I have friends in the fraternity of the guy she's dating. I see her on the way to my classes and she pretends to read her phone most of the time she sees me. When we do make eye-contact, it's whenever she sees me with a new girl or just in passing. \n\n---\n\nI'm sure I'm the last person she wants to talk to, but it has been a very long time and the dust has certainly settled. There's just awkwardness whenever we're in the same place. I just feel like sending a simple email saying something along the lines of \"Hey, X, it's been a while since we've talked. I hope you're doing well\" to show that I have no hard feelings anymore. What do you guys think? Sorry for the wall of convoluted story..\nTL;DR:"}

Feedback and evidence are welcomed.\nPOST: So this an anecdotal but here it is. I was talking to one of my aunt who works for the HR department in a  university. She informed me that since thousands of grads and incoming students try to get jobs, there is no way they have the manpower to read all the applications. The solution: outsourcing the resumes to countries like Pakistan and India. If you don't fulfill all the requirements they are looking for, the real employers won't even see your resume.  This leads me to wonder if this is an example of the larger trend in the workplace. It makes sense, it would take a whole department to just sort through the resumes for major corporations like Starbucks or Walmart\nTL;DR:"}

I'm looking for advice on getting him back, not getting over it. I love him very much and I can't just give up like that. I don't know how reddit can possibly help but I'm desperate. Please help?

When he asked me to leave he did so politely and calmly, he stated his reason and although I disagree that it warranted kicking me out, it wasn't a bad reason and I found it to be fair from his perspective. The only issue I had was that he wanted to take the car and my phone back. Now when I lost my job he told me (I was still living there at the time) not to worry about it as I was planning to go into the military. Sadly they rejected me due to asthma and then he kicked me out. So by taking these things (which are 100% his to take) I felt he wasn't considering my well being and I asked later on for an apology. Now, he did let me keep these things but I feel that the fact he wanted to take them means he didn't even give a thought to what that meant and as he is my father I felt very hurt by this. \n\nAm I just an entitled kid who needs to understand that I'm not owed any of those things by anyone?

They were given custody and so began the cycle. When i was 19, I graduated high school and his excuse for not being there was he didn't have a ride. I offered to give him one but he refused. In the past ten years, I have had to be the one to call him if I wanted contact with him or if I wanted to see him. \n       To make matters worse, he began seeing someone less than six months after the divorce was finalized and I feel like I was replaced by his \"new\" family. I am so angry and so hurt by all this because he never has once called to tell me happy birthday or anything. It might sound silly to complain about something as silly as this but I can't help but think about all the birthdays he has celebrated with all of them and cannot find the time to make one simple phone call. \nThe last thing i have a problem with is the fact that ive been with my boyfriend for  the past three years and I have been wanting to introduce him to my dad. Everytime ive tried it's i dont want to meet him because i dont need to. I just wanted some kind of approval from him because I am his daughter and well, it's self explanatory from there. It seems like he wants nothing to do with my personal or external life whatsoever and it just really hurts.\n      I love him, don't get me wrong. I mean, he is still my father but I wish he would start acting like one towards me.\nMy question is: when do you just quit trying? How should I move on from here in the best case scenario?

She says that she has sexted a lot of guys in the past, but now she refuses to sext with me because she says that it reminds her of those other guys she's sexted. Personally, I interpret that as the same as saying \"I don't want to engage in a certain sexual act with you because it reminds me of guys that I have previously engaged in those sex acts with.\" It bothers the hell out of me, and I've told this to her. I'll never force her to sext me of course or dump her for it, but do you think this is a legitimate reason for me to feel insecure about our relationship? Or am I being silly?\n\nIt's not the fact that she won't sext me that bothers me, it's her reasoning for it that it reminds her of other guys she's sexted. I would understand if she didn't want to sext because she didn't want the photo to leak somewhere, but that isn't the case at all. I mean, what if in another context she refused to kiss me for the same reason; that being she's kissed a lot of guys in the past but kissing me reminds her of all those guys that she's already kissed and so she refuses to do it. It's the reasoning that bothers me... The thing is, all the guys she's sexted, she was never even dating.

This morning bf randomly checked his receipt and noticed that the tax charged to him was 10% of the subtotal. Checked on my bill and the tax was 10% also. We then double-checked and confirmed that the sales tax rate in the area is actually 9.5% (6.5% state plus 3.0% local/county).\n\nWhile we're sort of peeved that we got overcharged, the difference in tax on both our bills is laughable ($0.03 and $0.21) so there's no desire for personally suing for compensation. I'm just concerned that the place may be \"skimming off the top\" sort of speak; overcharging everyone on tax and pocketing the difference.\n\nWe've been to this bar a few times before but this is the first time we've noticed this issue (I usually either throw away or crumple the receipt in my pocket and wash it in the laundry days later). No idea at all if this has been going on for a while. Haven't notified the bar yet because we just discovered it and the bar's not open yet today. \n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n* Is there any possible legal justification for \"rounding up\" or otherwise charging more in tax than what the state specifies? \n\n* Should I be nice and notify the bar first of this discrepancy? I guess there's a possibilty that their registers are set up wrong and they haven't noticed yet.

Personally I think she is absolutely perfect the way she is, but she wants to get back to her weight/figure from when we first started dating. To preface, she was only that weight because she worked out daily to vent all of her stress from her previous relationship.\n\nShe has tried to lose weight many times during our 5 years together, but has always given up when the going gets tough. Her best attempt was when she did weightwatchers after it worked for her mom a few years back. So this past christmas I bought her a membership to Weightwatchers online and she has been doing amazing. Keeping track of her food like a champ and losing weight the first month. But after that initial start up loss of weight she started to stop keeping track of her intake since she said she knew it all by heart and ate the same stuff anyways which then led to her being too scared to weigh herself weekly since she didn't want to see if she had been gaining any weight. I should also add that she is in graduate school and has a difficult time finding free time to work out.\n\nBasically I am at a crossroads here. If I push too hard I feel that she will think that I care too much about her getting back to her old figure, in a bad way. But if I don't push then I feel that she will give up like every other attempt and get into a slump because of it. \n\nWhere do you all suggest I go from here?\nTL;DR:"}

I work on a team of three people, and my other two co-workers always leave me out of the loop. They make decisions without me, have meetings without me, go to conferences together without telling me. They're close in age and have become good friends, whereas I fall behind by about ten years. They're both very creative minded and I'm more business minded. Whenever I voice my opinions they don't seem to take them seriously. \n\nI scheduled a meeting to voice my concerns with my director about a month ago. He apologized and told me he would make an effort to make me feel more included. However, nothing has changed since that meeting. \n\nI'm so torn. I really love the work I do, but I'm having trouble working with my team. I feel as if they don't respect me or my opinions and it has been really difficult to stay positive. I'm tempted to look for a new job, but I'm scared I would regret leaving such a great gig. Fulfilling work isn't easy to find, after all. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this?\nTL;DR:"}

In these 3 years I've tried so hard to better myself.

My girlfriend, however, seems to be doing the opposite.. \n\nShe doesn't care about anything. She's always been sort of like this, but we started dating at 18 and I chalked it up to her just being young, but as time goes on I see I was wrong. She dropped out of high school because she was just too lazy to wake up at 3pm, I saw this at a problem but I loved her! She's currently working on getting kicked out of college.. Her GPA is a .75 (no, that isnt a typo) and she hasnt been to class in 3 weeks. She's gaining weight, knows it, and doesn't care, she doesn't wake up until 5pm now and hardly ever even gets ready. She's developed anger problems and everything I say to her is misconstrued as mean. The other day I said \"I wish I heard from you before 6pm today, everything is closed now\". This started an arguement and her giving me the silent treatment and asking to be taken home (she doesn't have a car).\n\nI'm emotionally in love with her, kind of. I'm physically not in love with her at all anymore. She's just let herself go so much that I cant even see her as attractive anymore. I know the advice people give will be \"break up\", but I'm just wondering if anyones experienced this for themselves\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by singing at a speaking exam\nPOST: This was actually years ago.\n\nI was attending to a English course which gave certificates at the end of the course if you pass the exams. So it was the exam day. Writing, grammar and listening exams were held in classrooms. After those, speaking part came along. Speaking part of the exam was a bit different. They divided us in groups of 6 and put each one of us in different small rooms that were only intended for speaking exams. It was a small room that only one person and the computer can fit, and the doors were shut. We were supposed to make a video conference with an actual foreigner. We put the headphones with mic on, and waited for the connection to happen.\n\nThere was a technical difficulty, and the waiting time was a bit longer than expected. I was bored, and there was a ridiculous pop song popular at that time which somehow got stuck into my brain and I kept singing it without even realising. As I was bored, waiting to be connected, I started to sing that ridiculous song. The doors were shut, I was alone in room and the connection weren't ready, so I didn't keep it down. A few minutes passed with me singing the song, and the connection was finally established. I stopped singing, got serious and took the exam.\n\nAfter we all got out of the room, I realised the strange look of the people on me. I didn't mind though. One of the guys from that group of 6 was my friend, I approached him to ask how was his exam and the moment he saw my face he bursted out a huge laugh. It turns out, the headphone mics from all 6 rooms were connected from the beginning. All 5 of the guys just sat there and listened to me serenading until the exam starts. Also that b***ard didn't warn me at all.\nTL;DR:"}

We have known each other very loosely for about 5 years, like we went to college and had a couple classes together, became FB friends, and basically didn't speak again until recently. \n\nOur first couple dates were great: we went out, had a few drinks, went for a hike, kissed a bit... you know, the general good vibes you get after a couple fun dates. The last 5 or 6 times we have hung out though, it's either been in a group, or just with a friend or two of hers. Like, she always wants her friends to be with us when we hang out. My first impression was that the friendzone was coming, but she has increased her touching/affection while around me in front of them to the point where that is out of the question. My second idea was that maybe she just wants to show me off to her friends? I am the most non-threatening person ever, never aggressive or violent, so it can't be that she doesn't feel comfortable around me i feel like. \n\nHas anyone else ever experienced this or done this?

I dated him for only two months, about 2 years ago. Since then we've been friends. I've dated other people, and he's done his usual sleeping around and whatnot... but there's always this deeper thing between us. we've almost gotten back together before, but not quite. We love each other, but have kept our distance because of certain issues that i'll list in the cons section. Here we go:\n\nPros: He treats me very well. He's always up for adventures with me (traveling, etc). We have the same interests, short term goals and long term goals. I can be myself 100% around him. He's honestly like a best friend (that I don't sleep with). My friends and family love him, and the likes them as much. He has a good heart and is a hard worker too (things that I deeply respect about him)\n\nCons: These are things that has happened both when we were together and not:  He's an alcoholic (that caused problems last year when he ditched me at NYE for a girl at the bar, after he kissed me at midnight, and we were on a road to getting back together.). He's also an attention \"whore.\" (I mean this as in if a girl comes up and flirts with him or touches him, he doesn't back off, he just says, \"well she started it. I didn't do anything!\"). And the sex with him is pretty horrible. \n\nI feel like letting him go, because he's a really good friend of mine, would be a mistake. But we actually can't continue being friends, because the feelings just run too deep. It's either in or out. I know people would stay in worse situations, or even leave even if they were better... but realistically, I just hope I'm not asking for too much, or about to let someone go if it's only bad in my head? ... it sounds bad on paper though too, at least to me.\nTL;DR:"}

I spend the night at their house a lot, and lately it seems that I've become part of \"the pack,\" insofar as that our friend has started treating me as shitty as he treats everyone else in the house.\n\nExamples: Slamming doors and stomping around the house early in the morning, breaking dishes, days of silent treatment, sarcastic comments, general assholery. He passes out drunk a lot and leaves things going in the slow cooker or simmering on the stove, and yells at the whole house in the morning because either A) nobody turned it off, or B) somebody turned it off. If this was occasional I don't think anyone would mind so much, but it's almost every day. He wakes up angry and stomps around the wraparound porch at 7am...there's nothing to do out there, so presumably he's just trying to make sure he passes everyone's bedroom and wakes them up, too.\n\nThis morning I was having trouble starting my truck in the cold (it's an old truck that I haven't totally figured out yet, I literally bought it FROM HIM yesterday) and he came to my window and said in a nasty voice \"Gas makes it go, sweetheart\" and walked away laughing. \n\nIt ruins my fucking day to be woken up by him trying to let everyone know he's in a bad mood.

After that I've just felt like I couldn't do it anymore. Then about a week and a half later I seem disinterested and he asks if I want to I say I don't so he keeps trying and when he is not getting anything he says 'just a quickie'. I found myself really annoyed at him for saying that cause I don't see how a 'quickie' is going to make any difference to me not being interested.

I decided to vacation with her to see how I liked it.  I'm falling for this woman, she's awesome in every conceivable way.  The city is great for a bunch of different reasons.  I can easily have another job lined up with equal or greater pay.  I was pretty much sold.\n\nOne problem:  I am half retard; completely retarded, actually.  I cheated on her.  More than once, and more than I care to admit.  She found out; relationship is done. \n\nTwo years running this still haunts me.

I didn't decide on getting the degree partly into the relationship, she knew I was going to be doing it from the onset (In fact my drive to educate myself more is one of the reasons she says she loves me).\n\nHowever, it seems like every two weeks or so she gets angry at me which starts for a typically petty reason (a facebook post from one of her friends about their relationship or something I texted to her that she didn't like) that eventually turns into how I'm not taking our relationship seriously enough and not trying to improve our relationship.  She then typically says its because my ego is too big or because I'm too much of a child.\n\nI don't feel as if that's entirely fair because I text her throughout my day and try to talk to her on Skype every chance I get (1-3 hour conversations ~3 times a week) and I try to make them as meaningful as possible to learn more about her or to plan things for our future together.  This is all while spending about 12-16 hours at day at my lab doing research or class work.\n\nShe says I need to change to be the boyfriend that she wants and that nothing in the past has shown her that I care about improving myself or our relationship.  I of course do not feel the same way and feel like I'm bending over backwards trying to be the person that she wants me to be for because I love her but what I do to improve is \"not enough\" or \"too little too late\".\n\nIs it healthy for us to constantly have fights over the same thing and for me to try to change to be more of what she wants without asking her to change anything about herself in return?\nTL;DR:"}

He could find one anywhere, probably making more money that I can with mine.\n\nI've talked with my SO about what might happen when I get offered a promotion somewhere else.  Would he move with me? Should we be looking for a certain location? We are not looking at starting a family and I do not intend to just \"not work.\"  The city we are currently living in only has about 60k people in it, and is an hour and a half from anything worthwhile. I have already stated that I don't want to stay in our current city for more than 5 years- I really don't think I'd be happy there long term.  The best answer I can get out of him is \"I will move if I need to. I'm comfortable here without moving.

I know everyone here is going to say to be honest, but then I'll lose her and honestly she's the only girl on earth I want to spend the rest of my life with.\n\nIt gets a little more complicated because my ex hates her and is pretty crazy and I know it's likely she'll tell her what happened just to break us up if she finds out we're back together.

After the vacation I made up my mind to stop pursuing the other girl, but maintained a flirty friendship with her, which was wrong on my part. Later my girlfriend found out I had slept in a tent with this girl for two nights and made out with her, although I never went farther than that. To this day I'm not sure if she believes me.

Our relationship never really went back to normal, of course. Recently she told me that she is unable to trust men she dates. What can I tell her?

Her mother was diagnosed years ago with schizophrenia and I like most people really didn't know a lot about it and mistakenly thought it was multiple personality disorder.

Her mom is fine for now and is fairly calm so we both think she'll be okay but are keeping an eye on her.\n\nAs the possibility of marriage seems very plausible as things between us are doing great I was curious if people knew about tax breaks for people taking care of someone with a mental illness? I ask as I know her mom was in a Federal Care home (not mental institute) and my girlfriend feels they are really inadequate. Her mother is a fantastic person and I would help regardless of tax incentives but as neither of us is rich every bit does help. We both live in Canada and are Canadian citizens as is her mother. \n\nIf someone could recommend a subreddit for further info it would help too.\nTL;DR:"}

I honestly don't know why I did all that. I can't really explain. \n\nShe also knew I was lying about some minor furniture damage, but I didn't tell the truth because I was afraid of what she would think of me because my mother had been and is emotionally abusive. I remember that I wanted to tell her that it was me but couldn't. I also lied about being on my period because at the time, I was ashamed of it. \n   \nHer daughter didn't like me, and her son was little but said I was ugly. And that sort of impacted me I think because I felt unworthy, so I guess that made me want to hurt weaker animals and myself.\n\nAlso related is that my mom tells her everything, so she knows two instances that make me look even more sociopathic. Specifically, that I brought a weapon to school and that I made threats online that lead to a police investigation. She may or may not know of my self harm. \n\nRight now, to everyone, it looks like that I cleaned up. I go to an Ivy and I have an internship with a tech firm in her area.

Also, throwaway, because she knows my Reddit username. Once she went on vacation, we began to talk less and argue more over text.  \n  \nOccasionally, we would be happy with each other, but it wasn't as prominent. Two months of arguing goes by and, at the end of last month, she decides it'd be best to leave me. We talked for a few days afterwards (which was a bad idea, I know.) And she says that she \"still loves me\" and she \"always will\".  \n  \nI tried to keep NC, but she texted me once more over kik. We just talked about how we'd been. She was great, which bothered me. She told me she already started crushing on a new guy. Fast forward a week later, I see one of my facebook friends like her new relationship status. She's in a new  relationship with the guy she was crushing on (and, coincidentally, ALSO was crushing on before our relationship) and it hurts me. It took her one month EXACTLY to \"get over me\", yet I still find myself thinking about her everyday.   \n  \nCan someone help me get over her?\nTL;DR:"}

Yay. :p I'm 17 and I've been dating this guy for six months. He's incredibly important to me and we get along very well. About a month ago he was arrested for possessing marijuana and was released on bail. \n\nWhile my boyfriend was still in jail, his friend (we'll call him Thomas) approached me about helping to pay to get my boyfriend's car out of impound. I have a part time job in fast food and usually have a decent amount of money in the bank so I agreed. I gave Thomas $260 and he agreed that he would pay me back in installments.\n\nI didn't think about it until recently when my boyfriend told me that Thomas expected him to be collecting the money and giving it to me. Which he has not been doing. I'm not sure if I didn't understand what Thomas meant but now my boyfriend is upset about it.\n\nAnd insists he owes me the money. I feel very uncomfortable by this, even though my boyfriend recently got a job. I've never had anyone owe me money, let alone someone that close to me. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want money to be an issue between us. At the same time, it's not a particularly small amount of money for me.\nTL;DR:"}

Earlier this year we decided against starting a relationship \u2013 never been a fan of long distance relationships plus had we started seeing each other we would only be six months into the relationship before he left. So for the better half of this year we have just been keeping in touch and talking throughout. \n\nI've been in one relationship previously but never felt such a strong emotional connection with anyone - I guess that's why I've kept this window open for this long. We have lots of common interests, similar career aspirations. The problem started about two months ago. I got tired of waiting to be with him and told him that I wanted out. I thought he'd try to reassure me but instead two weeks later he came back to me saying he wanted out too. I haven't heard from him in about a month. I still really like him but am scared to recontact him and thought he needed time to cool off. He's leaving in about two weeks and I didn't really see the point of creating an issue now. I have no idea what to do \u2013 not sure whether to leave things till he gets back from exchange and then pursue things again.\nTL;DR:"}

After I turned 18,he wrote to my mom that he would only keep in contact with me if I wanted to.

So my contact with him kinda died off after a round of 3 or 4 emails. However, it was about two or three years ago that my mom told me that he really cared about me but he thought it would be better if he tried to stay out of my life as much as possible, since he had married afterward and had another child. He thought this would cause me less grief, I wish he hadn't(I tell you if I could have seen him even once a year I would have been a much happier child). \n\nI'm now 23 and getting a passport to go to Japan but I need information from him but I don't want it to sound like all I want his information.

I've only seen this side about 5 times in my lifetime. \n\nSounds fun, huh?\n\nOnly thing is...I do NOT want to go. I have a fear of vomiting, so any kind of activity that vomiting is a possibility, I avoid at all costs. Yes, there is medication, as well as procedures that I can do to prevent motion sickness, but these aren't 100% failsafe. I can even get a prescription for anti-anxiety, but is it really all worth it? I wouldn't even be able to drink...I was on a small ferry the other day, and even though I took Dramamine, the first ride I felt a little funny. \n\nAlso, I have big plans to relocate next year, where my funds should really be going to, and to be honest, who knows if I'll even have the time for the cruise?\n\nI feel as though I have made up my mind, and decided that I will no longer participate. However, I need your help with letting my family know my decision. It obviously sounds crazy, and they won't understand. They will say, \"you're being ridiculous, stop being a worrywart, it's a family reunion, why wouldn't you want to go...\" And THEN I'll even be the laughing stock of the whole group, and I'm already kind of, or on my way to becoming the black sheep.

He constantly walks all over her by promising \"i'm going to quit drinking\", and he never fucking does.

Anyway, he's now sleeping in his new dog bed after returning from a long walk and everything is all good...except...\n\nI started researching what is actually up with his eye - it seems to be cherry eye. I'm unsure whether it's truly just a cosmetic issue or whether this is something that needs to be corrected immediately. I'm a bit upset that I'm now reading that this \"cosmetic\" issue may cost upwards of 1k to fix. I have the money, but this was just a bit unexpected and I would have preferred to know this ahead of time. I will not be giving him back even if the surgery cost 5k, but I am feeling an extremely slight tinge of regret.

It's still early in the relationship but I feel that the relationship has serious long term potential. He is smart, funny, kind, and loving. We also have many life experiences in common.\n\nBut, that is also the downside to our relationship. The things we have in common, are the things that could tear us apart. I have struggled with an anxiety disorder for years and have also gone through clinical depression. My boyfriend has experienced depression as well. I believe that to some extent depression is still present in his life. \nAnother thing is, both of us have strained relationships with one or both of our parents. In my boyfriend's case has a very critical and detached father, and I believe that as a result his self confidence is extremely shaky.\n\nMy boyfriend is college educated and recently started taking courses again in the hopes of pursuing a new career path. He does have goals. I just think we both have doubts that he is going to make them happen. It's not that I don't believe he can do it but sometimes I don't know if he's driven enough to get his career off the ground in the near future.\n\nI've overcome my own past in many ways, I know it is doable. I'm in graduate school and planning to graduate in the spring. I have been very depressed with no hope at all and I eventually realized I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself and take action. I just want him to see the light. I can give it time but I just hope that he will figure it out for himself before I lose patience and start losing my cool about it. I just want to know is there anything I can do to help him, or should I just wait and see?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

A few hours later everything's done so I head home to help my SO with dinner, kids, and general house stuff, I figured my day was over.... NOPE.\n\nWell, while I'm painting our kitchen (remodeling is hell!) I have an epiphany, I never turned off the coffee pot at the office! I jump up grab my keys a head that way. I make it in the door and turn to the kitchen to see that the pot had already burst into tiny pieces and next thing I know the security alarm is going off.\n\nSo I call the local PD and let them know the situation, they tell me to call the security company. So I call the company, and now they basically tell me that they don't believe I am an employee at this location and are sending the police. FUCKING GREAT!\n\nThe police show up and have a nice chuckle once I explain the situation and then proceed to tell me that they have to call my boss to inform him of the incident and also to let him know there is a fine of $100 for coming out and conducting a security check. \n\nI have a meeting Monday morning with my boss, either I will have $100 withheld from my check to cover the fine and/or I will no longer allowed to make coffee.\nTL;DR:"}

Worried we may be moving too fast.\nPOST: First I should say that our relationship is going great and we are madly in love. We are extremely compatible and she has everything I am looking for. The only \"problem\" is that we are already talking about getting married and having kids. I say \"problem\" in quotes because I'm not sure it is one. I do want to marry her and have kids, but is it normal to feel that way so quickly?   \n\n  We met at work and were immediately attracted to each other. Neither of us wanted to cross that line at work though, so we just flirted here and there. It was about 6 months before we actually started dating.   \n\n  In the first few weeks of dating I felt an immediate connection with her. I really had to fight saying I love you because I didn't want to scare her off. Eventually I couldn't hold back and we have been professing our love since then. At some point while we were making out, we started talking about wanting babies. That really turned us on and now we are doing that a lot ;). This past weekend we starting talking about marriage, again kind of in the heat of the moment. I think it made both of us a little uncomfortable after the fact, but we were happy to get it out there. I think it had been on both of our minds, and we seem to be on the same page with all of this.  \n\n  Neither of us are that experienced in general so I worry that might have something to do with how quickly things are progressing. We've both had relationships before, but not that many. Neither of us have had one where we felt this way though. Also, we both hear the biological clock ticking and have been wanting to have kids since before we met. I know that is probably influencing us a bit.  \n\n  Not really sure what I am looking for as far as advice. Mainly I think I am just hoping for some re-assurance that this isn't all too good to be true?\nTL;DR:"}

Living across have created it's own problems. Nothing major just what you would expect in a 2,500 long distance relationship. We've seen each other 8 times in 12 months ,which is awesome. Now, we've planned for her to move to my city. First within 8 months, then a year, now in 4 months (16 months total). She works in the same field as me, in marketing, but makes less money and less work. I make good money, but have much more bills. Higher rent, more home bills, I have a child...so our spending money is nearly the same. Which she refuses to believe. Also the cost of us seeing each other have been covered mostly by me. Which becomes costly, and a bit counter - productive, since we are/were suppose to be saving money to move in n together.\n\nNow it's been a year, and she has no savings at all. And is behind on her bills. Which I have helped with in the past. But I'm at the point where, I feel I'm being used. I have my own bills, and need to be the one saving for us to move in.\n\nA little back story. She was abused mentally and sexually when she was a child. Was kicked out her house. And stripped from the age of 17-21. Which I'm okay with. She did what she had to do to survive. I'm actually impressed that she made it out that life, and hs become such a great all-around woman.\n\nBut, now when times are hard. She wants to go back to that life. Which to me is a deal breaker. I refuse to date a currently stripper, and deal with all the emotional/mental rollercoaster it brings. I thought she left that life in the past. What happens in a year if money is tight?\n\nHow should I approach this? How do I figure this out? Am I wrong? I really want to be with her. But I just can't take part in that lifestyle.\nTL;DR:"}

Made a throwaway just for this.\n\nIn my junior year in high school, we had this classmate who we liked to pick on - I'll call him Remy just for the sake of clarity. Although he was friends with all the guys in our class, we enjoyed picking fun at him and he never got pissed off at us, so it was all some good, friendly banter among us.\n\nOne day, one of the dudes in our class decides to try and pull on Remy's hair. A good few strands came off, but not too much to alarm us. I join in on the fun and pull a bit of his hair out, too, and one of the guys makes a joke saying that he might have cancer. It became a regular thing after that, pulling out his hair and suggesting he had cancer.\n\nFast forward to around three years later, and I get a text from one of our mutual friends. Remy's in the hospital after doctors discovered a large tumor in his head. I'm told Remy already has Stage 4 cancer, and the tumor was there for a few good years but wasn't found until that time.\n\nI'm hoping it's a cruel joke, but word gets around to people from our school that he indeed does have cancer and his health is going downhill at a fast rate. Some benefit events get organized to support him too, and our mutual friend gives me updates all the time about how his health is doing. Remy eventually comes to a point where he doesn't know some of his friends and stays in the hospital for an extended amount of time. I never got to see him during this time though.\n\nFast forward a few months more, and he finally succumbs to it. I go to his wake, and the first time I see him in years is when he's dead after battling cancer.\n\nFelt a little bad, and some people joked that he died because my classmates and I made fun of him. I know it's not my fault that he had cancer, I don't blame myself for that, but I wish I knew better than to make a joke like that.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm currently working in a restaurant and making $9/hr, so a little above minimum wage. But I'm lucky if I work 4 days a week and with shifts that are usually 4-5 hrs long it doesn't add up to very much.  \n\nHere is the problem: my older sister wants me to get a loan from my bank and lease a new car like she did and have monthly payments. She thinks it would be better having payments and a reliable car that will not break down on me. I feel like having a car payment and paying for insurance would just be too much of a financial strain on me right now. I want to save as much money as I can for college, she already convinced me to take a semester off college to save money and I think that was a good idea but I feel like leasing a new car would be foolish at my age and the little amount of savings I have. I'm just looking for advice, any help would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nI would also like to add I'm as dumb as a rock when it comes to things like this. I know how to budget and not spend when I don't have enough money so if I said something wrong or there is an option I'm over looking please point it out to me.\nTL;DR:"}

But I thought it was worth sharing!\n\nI (19 then) was looking to move closer to campus for next quarter so that I could walk to class and not have to deal with my messy housemates. I was desperately searching for a spot on craigslist when I found a great townhouse room right next to school. It was in off-campus student housing, so I had seen others with the same sort of houses and they all looked the same. I wanted to get it over with, with finals fast approaching, so I told the guy I would go through all the paperwork as quickly as possible. I asked about his roommate... he said he wasn't around much because of work but was a nice guy. So I thought as long as he's a student and the reason for this guy moving out was to get a house with his buddies, I'll be fine. \n\nSo I signed everything. Even though my Dad (really busy guy) had yet to open the email and sign the docs, the tenant handed me the keys for the deposit. This was all done at the leasing office of the complex, and instead of looking at the place I  went home, packed my stuff, and went to drop it off before going \"back home\" for winter break. I go to unlock the door, fumbling with the keys a little bit as it was my first time. Suddenly, the door opens and I'm standing face to face with my new roommate. A large guy who's easily 45 and kinda gives me the creeper vibe. We exchange pleasantries and talk about how we BOTH just moved in, and he tells me about some of the holes in the wall he was fixing up. Also kinda teases me about not having seen the place yet. Yeah. During all this, the sour stench of the place hits me. I dropped everything I brought with me into my room, said goodbye, and left. I was still processing my fuck up on the drive home when I realized my Dad hadn't signed anything yet. I frantically called him to keep it that way. I also received a well deserved lecture and, seeing as I couldn't handle the simplest of adult duties myself, he told me he would handle the rest of this.\nTL;DR:"}

She had the libido of a twelve year-old boy and I got to explore more of my sexual self than I ever thought I would in my lifetime. We broke up about six months ago, and even though it was clearly the right decision, it wasn't an easy one to make and the fallout has taken me a long time to deal with, but I think I might be ready for something new.\n\nI met a girl on OKC last month and we hit it off. She was living in another state for the summer, but now she's in my area because of school. After a few weeks of talking, she expressed interest in me sexually, but the first time it happened, I just kind of freaked out and abruptly cut off the conversation. Surprisingly enough, she was still interested in talking to me, so we kept going and avoided sexy things for the most part, until one night I got tipsy and we sexted each other (she was sober). When we were done, I felt really weird about it and told her that I didn't think I was ready for a relationship (which is what we both want, ultimately). We stopped talking for almost a week, but then I picked it back up because I found that I missed talking to her. \n\nShe's back in town now, and we have a date set up for next week. Last night we actually started getting pretty flirty and talked a bit about our sexual views, but nothing actually happened. Toward the end, she told me she was mostly naked because her room was hot, but I purposefully changed the subject and the conversation ended kind of abruptly.

My boyfriend and I brought home a 9 month old Jug last night (pug & jack russell). Her family just had another baby, and they couldn't take care of her anymore. She's not a barker, and when we were taking her home, she was fine.  Unfortunately, a couple hours later, after taking her for a walk, she started freaking out badly, seemed like separation anxiety for her family and the shock of being somewhere she doesn't know with new people. By freaking out, I mean she started running around the apartment like a maniac, to the point where it looked she was going to hurt herself, and started almost biting us. Now when we picked her up from her family, she was running around a lot, and \"mouthing\" but not biting, so this is clearly behavior she was allowed to an extent, but is now to the extreme because she is terrified. We've had to keep her in her crate when not on her leash because she will not calm down in the apartment when free. Is keeping her in her crate too long a bad idea when she may hurt herself throwing her body around the apartment? Should we just let her run around like a maniac until she tires herself out, and then praise her? I'm confused because I don't want her to think the behavior is okay, but I do want her to start getting used to her new home. Please help, I appreciate any advice on how to get her to calm down,we can't keep her in the crate forever!  Were trying to make sure we're always calm with her.  Taking her for a long walk this morning as well, where she will be made to heel.  Do I let her get away with a fair amount of bad behavior for the first few days while she adjusts?\nTL;DR:"}

Here's some background on my relationship. I have dated \"George\" for almost a year. It has been great, he's very caring and attentive and we've always had a good time together. \n\nHowever, the farther we get into this relationship, the more commitment he is expecting. We are already monogamous, but occasionally he has joked about the topic of marriage, and I am clearly not ready considering that I am in high school. \n\nAlso, over the time we have dated, my attraction to him is slowly decreasing and I don't know how to change that. \n\nThis is his first relationship and I don't want to hurt him. He already knows that we are going to talk today, and he is upset because he knows that we may be breaking up, but I'm not sure to address him or explain how I am feeling. \n\nPeople of Reddit, do you think I should break up with him? Also, how do you think I should address him and explain how I am feeling about him?\nTL;DR:"}

When we first got together she was overweight (which didn't bother me at all). Now, a year down the line, she's put on a lot of weight (I'd guess around 3-4 stone) and would probably be classed as morbidly obese. She's self admittedly addicted to sugar and most days will go to the shop and buy bags of sweets/chocolate/sugary treats and probably eats McDonalds about 3 times a week. She tends to blame it on her past and says she uses it as a crutch. Admittedly, her mum's ex-partner wasn't a very nice guy when she was younger but surely that's no reason to continue eating a bad diet for the rest of your life ?\n\nShe lies about a lot of things (including her eating habits) so I kind of have to take what she says she's eaten with a pinch of salt. She's said on more than one occasion that she's going to join a Weight loss club but this has never materialised. My main concern is that she's so young and she's putting her health at risk. I've tried dropping hints about not eating so much sugar and have recommended on her cutting down. Each time I do this she'll either snap at me or get emotional. I feel like a d-bag each time I try and mention it but I'm worried about her, especially has her family have a history of Diabetes. Another thing that worries me is that I'll stop being attracted to her. I'm by no means a guy that would leave someone for putting on a bit of weight but the amount she has put on is so drastic and I just feel like there's no helping her.\n\nHow do I go about getting her to clean her diet up/tell her I'm worried about the future consequences ? The way things are going I'm really struggling to carry on as it's really hard to watch someone put their life at risk and feel so helpless at the same time.\nTL;DR:"}

I am currently friends with my ex and she says she has no feelings for me. She's with a new guy but still sees me multiple times a week. Enough to make me question if she really does have no feelings for me. I think the relationship she is currently is a rebound relationship. Her new boyfriend has openly said her new guy complains that all she does is talk about me.  They just fought the other night because she has been seeing me so often but she continues to do so.\n\nMy question to all you is what do I do to get her back in this situation? I have heard many things. We had our initial no contact period. She came back and was visibly upset at how well I've been doing and how I completely turned my life around for the better. I am currently acting like I've completely moved on and am unsure of what I can do at this point.  Do I confess my feelings for her apologize for my fuckups and throw my whole heart on the line? Do I go no contact again to make her miss me. Do I continue being friends with her and hope she can realize she does still have feelings? I understand our relationship would be different and we've talked about it and mutually agreed to what we did that was wrong in our old relationship. She has openly said she still has a very strong sexual attraction to me.\nI need help getting her back, what do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

I have met some of her friends when I have visited in the past (and I visit somewhat regularly). I know my partner and her friend has a little 4-person study group going, so that there is two women (my girlfriend and her friend) and two men, with my girlfriend's friend dating one of the guys in the study group.\n\nI am fine with this, I trust my partner. However recently the single guy in the group (let's call him X) asked my girlfriend to get brunch one morning while they were skipping classes, and my girlfriend didn't realise it was just going to be her and him, so hung out with the guy one-on-one. She told me this 24 hours later and assured me nothing happened and it didn't mean anything - this didn't phase me too much as I trust her. However, what bothers me is that my girlfriend's friend said after the 'date' \"so... what did you think of X?\", as if she knew she knew it was date yet knowing my my girlfriend and I were still in a relationship.\n\nI guess I am getting more and more bothered that my girlfriend's friend would rather her date X so that they would have this two-couple study group. Am I right to be bothered by this, or should I just let it go? I know a lot of advice on here is \"it doesn't matter what others think, if it bothers you then it bothers you\" but I am curious if it would bother anyone else.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half.  We share an apartment together and work opposite schedules, so we don't actually see that much of each other.  In fact I have kind of gotten used to being by myself.  As time has gone on I have become less and less physically attracted to him, to the point where I don't even want to cuddle or be cuddled by him or even hold hands.  Obviously this is not acceptable and not fair to him, so about a week or so ago I tried to break up with him.  I did not focus on the lack of attraction, but instead on other true elements of our relationship, such as that we no longer have much in common and that I have zero sex drive and that we rushed into living together.  He said he was blind-sided even though I had been noticeably more quiet, depressed, and reserved for the past month or so.  He pleaded with me not to throw the whole relationship away.  I told him I would \"sleep on it\" and ended up agreeing to give it more time.  I emphasized that I couldn't make any guarantees though.\n\nNow it has been a little over a week and I think things are even worse.  He is acting like nothing happened and wanting to go out with me to dinner/movies and long walks.  I feel like everything I said was just glossed over and he thinks I was just having a bad night or something.  I can't handle the pressure and I know he is expecting me to be affectionate again.  I should've just stuck to my guns and not said I'd give it more time.\nTL;DR:"}

The last 6 months of which were long distance.\n\nThe reason for breaking up was that I had moved away for a better job and she was unwilling to move to this new city. I was also unwilling to return back home. Nothing to do with cheating, no drama in particular. The breakup was amicable and respectable, I would say. However, one day we just stopped talking and we haven't talked since.\n\nI understand NC is an important part of the healing process and I don't want to re-kindle or give the impression that I want to re-kindle. I believe, (and I believe she does too) that it's better to move on. \n\nThe only reason I want to contact her is because there's certain things of mine in her possession that I would like returned at some point. Nothing that I gave to her as gift or anything, just personal objects that I left there last time I visited (a wood-cut print, an old passport, a book...)\n\nWhat is the protocol?

I'm sitting here wallowing - maybe it will help to write out my situation.\n\nMy GF who I deeply love just told me that for the entire length of our 5 year relationship she's never been physically attracted to me. It's gotten so bad that she can't take it and she wants to break up. Obviously this hurts tremendously and I feel like I'm dying. I'm also extremely confused. How could she have kept this bottled up for 5 years? Why didn't she end this sooner? How can she claim to still \"love\" me, but then feel no attraction? Isn't physical attraction a necessary ingredient for romantic love?\n\nWhat's confusing is that she's always been extremely affectionate towards me. Loves PDA, snuggling, and kisses me constantly. Our relationship is very good, we don't fight, we're always laughing and talking, I was ready to propose and even went to the ring shop. The sex has never been great or frequent, but when we do make love I always felt like she was enjoying it. It always seemed like she had a low sex drive, but for me that was never a big deal. I loved her so much and I know that no relationship is perfect.\n\nWhat's going on? She insisted to me that she isn't a lesbian and that she's attracted to other men. It's just that she never ever felt attraction to me. She kept waiting for it to happen cause \"I'm such a great guy\" and she thinks \"I'm good looking.\" Hearing all this hurt even more. She waited 5 years?! I'm utterly devastated. I was really ready to ask her to marry me.\n\nI don't know what to think. Is she lying? Is it really possible to be in love with someone, but feel nothing physically? Should we really break up if everything else is perfect? Should I be madder at her? What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Katy was with him the ENTIRE time he was staying, and he was never left alone. He also did not know there was a gun in the house, and neither did Katy. Neither of them likes guns and won't be around any because he was on parole, and some other personal reasons. She actually moved out that day, and was moving out prior to this incident because her roommate drinks too much. \n\nAnyway, dude has been in county lockup, and hasn't bailed out because he doesn't have the money. His PD told him the best idea was to take a deal, because he is a prior offender. He told him that no one would believe him, and that even without evidence of theft (there is none) that he would be most likely convicted. The gun is nowhere to be found, and the old roommate constantly has people in her house that are her friends and her 20 something son's friends are always there too. She and I both think someone else took it. \n\nMy question is, can he really go down for a crime that there is no evidence for? Or should he request a new public defender or attorney and fight it?

As I didn't attend, a default verdict was given and I now owe \u00a3330, which is a \u00a3200 fine and \u00a3130 court fees. I can't tell the court that I didn't get the letter due to leaving home because obviously not notifying the DVLA is an offence in itself and carries a heavier fine; so I'm electing to just pay the fine any try to move on.\n\nProblem being, I don't have \u00a3330, and I won't have for another month, though the fine is due in 2 days. I want to ask if I could perhaps pay an amount this month, as a gesture of good faith, and then pay the rest next month once I have been paid.

I've had health insurance in the past, but it was so crappy that I ended up paying more than what I would have to if I didn't have it. They made me pay the copay and then I got a full doctor's bill for the check-up. I argued my face off but didn't get anywhere. (cigna)\nEven despite this, the poor treatments I have received in this no-one-gives-a-shit city has left a bad taste in my mouth with the medical industry. So I gave up. I still have some of a hospital bill left over to pay and they ended up telling me \"we don't know what's wrong,... no idea. But you're a young adult so you'll get over it.\" (their response to someone bringing me in because I was having a seizure)\nTrust me... it's bad here. Most people with life changing problems end up in another city. The ones that don't... die.\nSo I am reluctant to even try to put effort into this.

I'm not cheating and I never wanted too.\n\nBut since that talk we've been fighting a lot about unrelated things but deep down I know I'm picking fights with her because of that.  I don't trust her like I did and she just seems different to me now.\n\nI don't know if I'm being mean by holding her responsible for her past, but doesn't what you did in the past reflect who you are today in some respects?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Mega Millions Lottery money making scheme?\nPOST: Ok, so the Mega Millions lottery is currently valued at $540 Million.  that's over half a billion dollars.  The odds of winning is something around 1 in 176 million.  Thus, if I were an enterprising rich billionaire, or investment group, I think investing 176 million dollars to buy every possible combination of numbers would ensure I would win the mega millions lottery.  I doubt I'm the only one to notice this and see this possibility.   Chances are there will be a couple winners at this point which would cut the prize down from 540 to 270 million.  Even if you invest 176 million, you'd still walk away with  over 90 million dollars.  Actually probably even more since your purchase of 176 million would add at least 80 million to the 540 million jackpot.  so you'd probably walk away with 130 million if there were 2 winners.  That's a tidy sum.\n\nSo my question is:  Is there some system in place that prevents people from doing this?  I'm assuming someone rich enough is going to try this. Maybe I'm crazy, but if I think this is a legit way of making a quick 100+ million dollars.\nTL;DR:"}

The dog mainly just has a bad temperament and can be difficult to handle because there are things he doesn't like, and if you were to push him he would probably bite. This extends from things like petting when he doesn't want to be pet, to taking care of wounds. He also has to be told to get in his crate in a certain way or he will hide under the table, where I am quite sure he would bite if we tried to pull him out. He's a very particular dog and there are things that he is very sensitive to, and we would like to learn the best way to handle this and reduce his sensitivity.\n\nI live in San Diego and was very excited to learn Kikopup from youtube lives here as well, since the industry is not very well regulated. I emailed her and we talked back and forth, and she said it is a difficult issue but she can help us work on it. I asked whether she had any certifications, however, and she said no. She gave me a link with people in the area who are certified and have been vetted by person who made the list, so there are those as options, however since I have seen her work on youtube I feel decently comfortable with her.\n\nAnyone have advice on who to hire?

I'm sure most of you are familiar with the man and his church, but Louie Theroux has an excellent documentary about them where he lived with the family and attended Westboro Baptist Church. You can catch that [here.] As most of you know, the church is notorious for picketing funerals of dead soldiers and generally causing emotional havoc on mourning families. While this is probably the most disgusting excercise of the first ammendment ever, it has inspired opposers of the church (non-believers and believers alike) to ban together and drown out their hate. This is the only bright side of the Phelps family. They have united people on a basic human level regardless of religion or politics to stop them.

She clearly isn't having any of the same thoughts I am. I've been feeling this way for a while, but I've just never been sure what to make of it. I remember feeling like I wasn't into her anymore while we were apart, but when we got together, those feelings completely subsided. We hung out tonight, and it's the first time I've ever felt that way while hanging out with her. I'm about to go to college, and I'm really wondering if it's just time to break up, but I have no idea how to just spring on her that I don't feel the same way about her that I used to. I've never given her reason to think there's something wrong, and I really don't want to surprise her, especially since her birthday is on Tuesday (the same day I leave for college). I have no idea what to do right now. Should I break up with her? If so, how should I go about it?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My (26f) boyfriend (28m) lied to me about going out to lunch today\nPOST: This all sounds sort of silly...\n\nMy boyfriend and I just moved out together and got a joint bank account. I take care of paying all the bills and it was easier to have one account rather than two. Anyway, today he came home from work and told me how good the lunch I made him was. But I was just looking at the account checking to see if bills came out and it said there was a sale for a local fast food place for today. He's at a league thing tonight so I texted him and just asked if he went to the fast food place for lunch. He fessed up immediately and said he forgot I made him lunch. \n\nIt really kind of hurts me that he lied to me. Not only that, we've been talking about eating better and more healthy. We are both a good bit overweight and the amount of money spent on food from restaurants is a little ridiculous (a good bit is from him going out to lunch). Also, I'm actually working towards getting weight loss surgery, so that's something that is going to definitely change MY life and life style. He says he will change with me, but sometimes I question it because he doesn't seem to be making any efforts to actually decrease the amounts of food he eats or the types of food he eats. I admit I still screw up with food a good bit, but I'm doing much better now that I'm on my way to get the ultimate tool to help me with my weight loss. \n\nI guess I really don't know what to do. I don't know if I should be as upset as I am about it. We are generally really good with communication (or so I thought), so for him to blatantly lie to me about something so stupid hurts. Plus he's spending money we could be using for something more important and showing almost no efforts to change his lifestyle with me. \n\nIs it reasonable for me to be pretty upset about this? Or am I just getting butt hurt because he didn't eat the meal I made him?\nTL;DR:"}

A week ago today he was on break and was just sitting by himself eating when his manager gave him a dollar and said he needs to give it to some other girl at work. So after he's done eating he goes up to the girl and she is busy making pizzas so her hands are covered in dough and stuff. He gently taps the dollar into her front pocket and jokingly says \"last night was great.\" Everyone laughed thought it was funny even the girl did. Only problem is that my friend is 19 and the girl was 16. The rest of the day goes by and nothing. All of Saturday goes by and nothing. On his break on Sunday another manager comes up to him and says I need to talk to you. He goes to her office and she asks him what happened on Friday. He says he has no idea what she's talking about. His manager says that the girls parents contacted her and wanted him fired because of sexual harassment of a minor. He's worried that even though he was fired that the family could still take legal action. How worried should he be?\nTL;DR:"}

He always apologizes after, but when he is explosively yelling at me or another member of my family a few times a week then his apologies are pretty hard to accept. It's always a \"I'm sorry I yelled\" but nothing ever changes with his attitude or behaviour. He has never hit any of us, but I am sometimes afraid that he will kill himself. I think he may suffer from depression or some other mental condition, but he won't go to counselling or therapy.\n\nI am a student with another couple of years in university.

She started hinting at this last fall and I have been blind to it as I do love her and tell her that still to today.  Here is my dilemma;  She found an old high school fuck buddy on Facebook.  He too is in a failing relationship but has not had the talk with his wife. To keep the level of scrutiny he is under down he had her create a fake profile on Facebook as a member of the opposite sex so their most innocent of daily banter is hidden, less obvious.  She came clean to me about 6 weeks ago about him when I caught her chatting him (I am a service technician and turned screen sharing on on her CPU). He has 4 children with his current wife and a previous; so that she can surreptitiously be part of their lives he has pushed them to friend her fake profile.\nWhen we, as a family, took our children to a Sox game this past week, I posted an image of us on Facebook and tagged her.  The following morning he went off on her and she unfriended me. I love this woman and want her in my life (loser) but she is killing me.\nTL;DR:"}

I am confident that infidelity is not an issue.\n\nWe have two kids, youngest is age 2. Raising young children is tiring and at the end of the day, my wife understandably would much rather sleep, so nighttime romance doesn't work. Morning sessions are also out because my wife likes her sleep. \n\nThe sex itself has been pretty routine pre- and post-kids. I've suggested different positions and locations and to her credit, she has been receptive (no pun intended) but finds missionary the only comfortable position for her. We use lube when necessary, have plenty of foreplay, and I am -- ahem -- average sized so that's probably not an issue either.\n\nIn the past, we I've expressed to her my desire for more frequent sex, her solution was to schedule it (Friday and Saturday nights), which I find somewhat undesirable because it lacks spontaneity. However, I've given it a try over the past 3 years and, well, you know how successful it was in 2014. 2013 was worse but that's because we had a newborn. 2012 wasn't much better.\n\nI feel pretty despondent about our marriage when it comes to sex. I can't find another partner (we both firmly believe in monogamy) and I feel like I can't bring myself to ask for sex because it feels like begging.

Would you buy a 2014 Nissan Leaf (~$30k financed, all-in) in this situation? Can I deduct the ad valorem tax imposed on new car purchases in Georgia on my tax return?  How well do you think that electric vehicles will hold their value in the future?  Is this plan a good idea, or am I missing something here?  Thanks for your help!\nTL;DR:"}

He is amazingly kind, sweet, caring, and supportive of me. He loves me so much and would do anything for me. Although we're young, we are both very mature in our relationship and have already gone through a number of bumps. In October of 2013, I started feeling really distant from him and I felt nothing for him for a few days. I decided to wait it out, treating it like a phase or a mood or something weird with me.\n\nAfter a while, some of my feelings came back but things didn't feel the same as they had a few months ago. I know I still love him, but I have gotten so bored... we never do anything, we spend every weekend at home watching a movie. I realize I'm young and there are other people out there, and I'm scared I am going to cheat myself from having experience with other boys (Others have put this in my mind). We do fight from time to time, and things get nasty sometimes but other than that, we are pretty normal.\n\nI have been trying for months to make sense of all this, but I just can't. Sometimes, I feel incredible with him, that I love him more than anything, and other times I feel mad and annoyed at him for really small things and also bored.I am torn... my heart and mind are confused.

We're practically married already, just no documentation. He recently said I had to propose to him because he asked me out. He said it jokingly, but it got me thinking... Why not? I love him, and I want to spend my life with him. Why should he have to make that move? Why can't I? I know he loves me, and we've talked about getting married once I finish college. Why can't I have the fun of planning an awesome proposal? I even have his \"engagement ring\" picked out lol. It'll be the one Ring from Lord of the Rings. So my questions...

He is now 5 years old and still fighting as best as he can.\n\nI want to add a little extra incentive to this because, well, [I need a haircut.] I haven't had a haircut since June, so, for every $5 donated I will shave 1.75 square inches of my head (that's the width of my clippers). With the average 140 square inches of scalp on the human head, that comes to $400. It would be cool if fellow redditors gave a few bucks to this, and would be awesome to get $400 so I can shave my whole head instead of just part of it. I'll probably do the shaving a couple of days before we get on the road for Duke and **I will post pics** of the shaving and screen caps of the final donation count, so you will see how much I shave according to how much is donated.

I want to be respectful, and as a fellow introvert I really really do not at all feel comfortable risking the anxiety of an unmerited approach for a girl like this. I also find that my type of girl is pretty well read and often very actively interested in current online feminism, and the notion that she might have a slightly quicker trigger to label me as a threat is really intimidating.\n\nTo go even further, I highly doubt one of these types would respond very well to an approach even if they were interested.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [26 F] with my ex [27 F] (together on/off for 2.5 years)--she just told me she has cancer and I don't know how to react.\nPOST: Hi, r/relationships. I've lurked for a while and have seen the wonderful advice you've given to other people who've posted here, so I hope I can get some wisdom from you too. \n\nAs it said in the title, my ex recently told me she was diagnosed with cancer (stage II cervical). She and I were together on and off for about 2.5 years in a VERY toxic relationship. I haven't seen her in almost a year, but we've occasionally spoken since (I'm not a believer in permanent NC, though sometimes I wish I were). Obviously there's a lot more detail to tell, but that's the gist. \n\nI've been with someone new for almost five months now and it's quite serious. But when I heard from my ex, it threw me for a loop. She messaged me out of the blue with the news, even admitting herself she didn't know why she felt the need to tell me. I did respond to acknowledge the message and offer my condolences, but now I don't know how I'm supposed to react as she continues to send me scant updates and also to ask how I am (usually also taking the opportunity to ask about my new relationship). Add to that, she doesn't have a great support system in general. \n\nSo...do I ask her how she is every now and then? Offer to be there? Ignore her? And if I did ignore her, would I be wrong to do that? I guess my bottom-line question is, how would you react or feel if an ex from a toxic relationship told you he/she had cancer?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] of 3 years, she made a new guy friend and for the last week, she has constantly been texting him. What signs should I look for if our relationship is going to fail?\nPOST: My girlfriend and I are both full time college and we live together. I have a full time job and she works part time. Everything has been great for the past 3 years up until recently when she made a new guy friend in one of her classes.\n\nFor the past week, she has been constantly texting him, from the moment she wakes up at 6 am up until 2 or 3 am at night, even when I fall asleep. When im at work, she texts me a couple times, but I got to read her messages and she is texting him every couple of minutes, when she could be texting me.\n\nShe has let me read the text messages and swears that its nothing and they are just friends. She also said that she feels lonely when I am gone and just needs someone to talk to and fill the void. Overall, the conversations they have are pretty school specific with a little bit of flirting both ways.\n\nI have been direct with her and she cries and swears that its nothing and I have nothing to worry about. Is this just me being jealous and over reactive, or does this seem like the first sign that our relationship is falling apart?\n\nI really have no idea what to do besides let time sort things out. I love her so much and she says she feels the same way but I have no idea how to tell based on her actions with this new friend.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: I'm a doctor and I'm broke. Help wanted.\nPOST: I don't like to ask for help. Like ever. I even hated asking my parents for anything all my life. I like being independent and self-sustained. I am a scientist, and have wanted to be one my whole life. I got my bachelors in microbiology (100K student loans), and my PhD in cancer biology (paid stipend by University, so no loans). My dad always said he would pay for my college, but then he died. And I mom can't afford it; she just lost her job about a year ago. So I'm here in my first real job (postdoc scientist) making a government sanctioned 42K a year regardless of location (I live in Boston, not the cheapest city in the world), and I can't make my loan payments. I have done forbearance for about a year. But that will end soon. I am paying my bills, then living off about $200 a month for food and life. I have credit cards from my stupid college years I feel like I'll never be able to pay off, and I'm tired of not making friends because I can't go to dinner or grab a drink with people. Even outdoor activities cost money. Maybe there is nothing I can do, maybe there are better job opportunities with more pay for my expertise, maybe there are financial ways of reducing or deferring payments. Maybe you can offer just a \"it'll all be OK in time\", because maybe that's all I really need right this second.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by locking myself outside without my phone, in winter, while working at home.\nPOST: Let me set the scene.\n\nIt's cold, below freezing cold, and windy with hard snow on the ground. I work second shift, afternoon to midnight, and today was my work at home day. This morning I locked myself outside when I took our puppy outside to relieve himself, I called my partner because he needed to run some errands and was about 15 minutes from home. Luckily we were smart and buried one of those rocks with a key hidden in some mulch under a rock, unfortunately the rock, snow, ground, and mulch were all frozen together. I was able to dig from the side and found the fake rock, and fished out the key using a small twig wedge between the false bottom and top of the rock. Because I couldn't properly dig up and replace the false rock with the key, I left it inside.\n\nFast forward to about 8pm at night. It's cold and dark outside, and our puppy is whining to go outside again, I take a break, and hurry outside, with just sleep pants, a t-shirt, and a coat. I forgot my keys, phone. My partner went to lunch downtown with friends, and I had no phone to call him with, and I had no idea when he would be getting back. The leasing office to the apartment is closed. I do not know any of my neighbors. And I have a cold puppy that just wants to go back inside. I check the backdoor to make sure it wasn't unlocked. I debated walking 15 minutes to work to call my partner or parents to help with the situation. But I decided to knock on my nearest neighbor's door with a light one. They were nice enough to let me use their phone, call my parents, and let the puppy inside. Luckily my partner was about 3 minutes from home, on their way back. It could of been a lot worse, freezing, with a whining puppy, missing work.\nTL;DR:"}

Let's call him 'John'. We both have grown up a lot in the 5 years and I have changed as a person and changed my views in what I want in a relationship. We have conflicting views on many things so I decided it would be best to part ways, and we ended it. \n\nA couple weeks ago, I had been introduced to his best friend [M21] and we ended up finding a lot in common and got along really well. We've kept in touch since then, we text everyday, sometimes Skype and talk on the phone. My ex, John, has told me how uncomfortable he is with the fact that his best friend and I are getting closer. He thinks it might lead to something more based on the amount we talk. It's true, it could lead to something more but at the same time John and I aren't together. So it's not like I'm being unfaithful. \n\nJohn has a best friend that is a girl and they are very close, so I didn't think he had the right to tell me I couldn't have a close guy friend.  When I brought it up to him, he said the main issue is that he's uncomfortable with it as the guy I'm talking a lot to is his best friend and it's pretty much violating 'bro code' and that it hurts him. John has told me he still has feelings for me, but I can't see us being together, at least right now. The situation sucks because his best bro and I really get along as we have common interests that John and I never had. \n\nIf we were in a relationship I of course would respect him enough to not let myself get close to his best friend if it made him uncomfortable...but we're not together...\n\nAm I in the wrong for getting close to his best friend? Even though we aren't dating anymore? Is he being controlling?\nTL;DR:"}

He was on the road to get put asleep, due to his survived aortic dissection (I'm not quite sure whether this is a proper name or not, however he couldn't eat anything that was in solid state, he could swallow and digest liquid foods only). \n\nSo I took him, paid $2,000 for the surgery, I still feed him in standing positing until he fully recovers, but most importantly, now I have the best, most loving 10-weeks-old puppie I could ever imagine. \n\nThe thing is, he just won't sleep alone. When he naps during he day, he just has to touch me or my fiance, even by the toe and then he falls asleep right away. Although, he likes to just lay full on our laps. \n\nWe took him to our bed for last 3 nights in a row, because we had guests and when he sleeps with us, he doesn't want to go out entire night - just sleeps 8 hours straight. \n\nTonight we wanted to put him back to his place (blankets and pillows, where he keeps his toys and where he sleeps when none of our laps is \"available\" for him). But he just didn't want to leave us, he started barking and howling and crying so loud my fiance started crying as well and it was really heart-breaking.\n\nI would manage to wait until he gets bored of it, but he howls so loud, our neighbors 4 floors above could easily hear him and it's long after 1am right now here in Poland. \n\nThe question is: what can I do to make dog sleep alone?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [23F] with my Boss [late 30s?F] how to deal with the potential fallout of quitting?\nPOST: I've been working at Boring Ltd since November when I was hired as a contractor on a 3-month temp-to-perm contract. Initially things were fine and I was made permanent from the middle of January. Within a few weeks I hugely regretted this and signed back up on all the job sites with an updated CV.\n\nI've also been severely depressed and anxious for at least the past five years (that's when the severity became doctor-verified), so I don't deal well with personal stress like this. I'm fine professionally since I can be detached, so it doesn't affect my ability to work.\n\nYesterday I took a day off to go to an interview (and sort out a bunch of other life-admin crap) and was offered the job that afternoon. Since then I've felt sick and panicky because I've got to tell someone that I don't want to work for them and it should really be my current boss.\n\nWhat makes this worse for me is that my boss since hiring me has made a huge deal about how she wants to \"take me under her wing\" because this is my first \"proper\" job (i.e. potential career move rather than crappy temporary stuff) and how she argued up my salary (which is high for a junior job like this) and how she needed *committment* from me to go permanent. She's also the only person I work with or report to and micro-manages me incredibly closely, which is part of me wanting to leave.\n\nBasically I can see her losing her shit and I know if she comes at me with it I will burst into tears. It's shameful and pathetic, I know, but stress from other areas of life have left me with effectively zero energy to hold back tears when I get overwhelmed right now.\n\nWhat I need is help with a script I can stick to for the inevitable anger and how to cope with working my week notice period with someone who hates me.\nTL;DR:"}

Please Help!!!\nPOST: Been a longtime lurker, but I've got to say that a lot of the changes that i've made to my seriousness in education is because of this subreddit. \n\nI was forced to leave my previous school because of my own stupidity. I smoked everyday, drank everyday, girls everyday, etc., to the point of it becoming the priority of me being there. I left with a GPA of 1.95 (Yea) and the look of shame that a GPA like that brings. I took the next semester off and figured out what I need to do to become a better student. Went to CC for 2 semesters and got pretty good grades (Mostly B's, a couple of A's, and a few C's). I was able to transfer to my current university and i've been there for the Fall and Summer semesters. \n\nThis new university has a forgiveness policy that doesn't take into account my previous GPA's, and from the 21 credits that i've taken so far, I have only 1 B, making my GPA a 3.59 at the university. While i'm very happy about my accomplishments so far, I can't help but feel like my past work might eventually catch up to me when i'm applying for gradschool, post-school jobs, etc. I wanted to see if anyone from this sub has any information on what chances I have to still get into a good gradschool.\nTL;DR:"}
