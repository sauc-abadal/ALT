Her name is Bonbon and she's a big sweetheart. She gets along with everyone and loves to play.\n\nEver since I brought her home, my aunt and uncle kick her, spray her with the hose, stomp their feet and shoo the dog whenever she gets remotely close to them (which really spooks her, since she's a shy dog). We have two other dogs, but those belong to my aunt and uncle, and they're pretty spoiled.\n\nI confronted them a couple of times about how they're treating my dog, but they literally could not care less about what I say, but always mention that my dad has also been 'mean' to the dogs as well. (To be honest, he has chased them out of the house when they come inside [dogs are not allowed inside], and has spooked them by chasing them while scraping a random item on the floor because he thinks it's funny. I've talked to him, and I still do, I don't want this behavior to continue). They seem to be doing this solely for revenge, even though the dog is MINE, not his. \"He's mean to my KID'S DOGS though\" is her excuse. Read text in parenthesis above.\n\n(I've talked to my dad about the situation and he said he talked to my aunt about it, but this is still going on. My aunt and uncle are very stubborn and my dad is easygoing and avoids confrontation, so it doesn't go well.)\n\nNo matter WHAT I say, they won't listen, and this situation is stressing me out incredibly, which triggers heart palpitations (I'm getting it checked out, it's not only triggered by stress)\n\nHow can I get them to stop being mean to her..? She's only a puppy, and the last time this happened (with my other uncle, who used to live here), our old dog got aggressive, and we got reported to the shelter.\n\nPLEASE HELP\nTL;DR:"}

Usually it is just normal cat behavior, like she is letting off some steam or whatever, but sometimes she acts violent when doing it, her ears are back, her eyes are huge and is you approach her she will growl and try to slap you in the face/claw your eyes out. And she runs around the house (she has 3 of those cat-trees, and all of them get climbed in like 30 seconds). Sometimes she has to stop to catch her breath (heavy panting with mouth open), but then she starts again.\n\nAnd since I am a worrier, I have started to get worried. I dont like the crazy running around part, but what worries me is the aggressive behavior. Is that normal?\n\nIf it is not normal, I have a couple of ideas of what could be causing:\n\n- We have recently started training her with a litter kwitter. It goes really well and when she is doing her business she seems just fine with the new \"arrangement\". \n\n- Two out of her three cat-trees are recently bought second hand, so they might still smell of \"other\" cats. \n\n- We have been traveling a lot recently, leaving her with friends and family. \n\n- We have started to take her out on a leash and she LOVES it.

We've been together for 3 years now and we work at the same place, we also have our own place together as well. We both suffer from depression and we both are very very bad procrastinators. And we are currently laid-off from our job.\n\n  Last night I get back from a night out with a friend and we just started talking about how we both currently feel.  He is struggling with a few health problems as well as his depression. His father passed his senior year of high school and it left him pretty messed up as that was his world at the time, and every since then he's been surrounded by a abundance of people, wether it be friends or family.\n\n  He told me he's never had time to learn to live on his own and just be by himself. He also said he's terrified of losing me like he did his dad. He also feels that if im gone there will be no one to be there for him but just him. So hes using that as his motivator. that's why he just wants to be on his own and ship me back to my moms.  Plus he thinks it'll help me with my struggles. But he told me this isn't a break-up it's just something he needs to do.\n\n  So right now I'm a living wreck writing this, this guy is my best friend, my one true soul mate. I don't know how I can just leave or try and convince him that I just want to help .\nSo should I try and talk to him since this all happened last night or should I just pack up and head to my moms.\nTL;DR:"}

Recently, she got a bladder infection and had to go to the hospital.  After meeting with the doctor and all that jazz to get treatment, she went to the bathroom.  My grandpa let her go to the bathroom.  By herself.  Now, being at her advanced age, that was not the smartest thing to do.

We had not had an opportunity to do so in the last few months, so I guess we were stupid and desperate. We didn't have a condom and only an hour. Instead of going outside for 20 minutes to get it, I asked her if it'd be okay since it was the first day of her period. She said yes, and we had unprotected sex.\n\nAfter a minute I thought this was fucked up, so I pulled out and stopped. She agreed and we showered. She was in a hurry to get somewhere, so she left soon.\n\nShe called later during the day, crying. She was worried that she might become pregnant, and more importantly disappointed in herself that she let that happen. I consoled her saying that it was stupid for both of us, and that we learned that it just isn't worth the worry and regret, and that we'll never let it happen again.\n\nAt this point, I'm not really worried about pregnancy. She was on Day 1 of her menstrual bleeding, I didn't come even close to coming inside her(precum something something, but still), and she took plan B within 12 hours. But I've still been feeling pretty terrible. I can't stop thinking about how much I hurt her because of an impulse, and that I should never have asked her. I keep thinking I'm a terrible person, that maybe I allowed it because we had already discussed abortion and she agreed to it.\n\nI'm not sure if it'd be appropriate to talk to her about these feelings since she seems to have recovered emotionally already, or at least it seems that way from the way she acts. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, and I feel like if someone else thinks so I might have an easier time getting over this event with a lesson learned. What do you guys think?\nTL;DR:"}

I realized then that I was capable of more than I let myself believe. Have you ever experienced something similar?\nTL;DR:"}

[20 F] of 5 months, I went home for summer and meet a girl who became my girlfriend.\nPOST: So I am a [21 M] college student who goes to school out of state. I had a [20 F] who I was dating at school for a while, 5ish month, but we were never official just fooling around and hanging out a couple of times a week. When the semester ended last spring I told here I that we should keep talking but I wasn't looking for a relationship, but that I would consider it when I got back to school. \n\nSo I went back home for the summer and a month later I saw my now [21 F] girlfriend of 4 months. We went to high school together and I finally got the courage to ask her out on a formal date. All the mean while still talking to my S.O. at school.So she said yes and we clicked almost immediately and I had feelings I never had before. So after a month of hanging out and dating I finally ask her to be my girlfriend cause I felt so strong about here. All meanwhile I'm still talking to my S.O. at school and she slowly stops talking to me, not knowing about my girlfriend, which is why I decided to stop talking to her and focus on my girlfriend. \n\nSo I came back to school for fall and I have seen my [20 F] friend/ S.O. a couple of times this semester, I assume she knows since its on facebook and all, and she didn't look at me let alone talk to me. I don't see her that often and its not like I'm avoiding her either, but every time I have she just walks away. \n\nOther Background Details: I love my girlfriend and the long distance is working out well. The other girl was too much of a \"bro\" for me to commit to. \n\nSo basically I just want to know what you guys think. Am I a bad person? Should I talk to her?

They are all false, it's a long story but it should be going to trial in November 2011. \n\nI graduated from college a month after he was arrested. I was supposed to move to Australia in May 2011 but I rescheduled my move to December because my Dad got bail. I stayed not only to support him but to spend time with him in case the jury found him guilty (he's facing 20-40 years). \n\nPros for leaving:\n-My Dad discussed with me that he wants me to leave to take pressure off of him. \n-I will be relaxed back in Australia and not under so much stress.\n-I can always come back right before the trial and go back when it's complete.\n-The trial might not happen in November for various reasons(it's the justice system, wheels turn slowly). \n-I'm living at my uncle's because I don't speak to my mother (after some things happened with my Dad's case.) My uncle and aunt don't sleep in the same room, and I'm taking their spare bedroom. It's a lot of stress on them to have my Dad and me here. This would be removed. \n\nCons for leaving:\n-If this goes badly for my Dad, I might not get to spend time with him... well... ever. \n-My family (mother, mostly, maybe others who I'm not close to) will accuse me of \"running away\" from the stress of what's going on.\n\n---\nI'm very torn between staying and leaving and need any advice or thoughtful perspectives.\nTL;DR:"}

Things didnt end the greatest and we no longer talk, see each other etc... In fact, I have her blocked on FB. I have no desire to talk to her. Before we broke up we, we talked about doing an Ironman triathlon at some point. After we broke up, I kept wanting to do it and still trained for it. Well, apparently my ex did to. She called me very briefly last december and chatted for 20 minutes or so and it turns out we both signed up for the same one. \n\nFlash forward to January, and I've met this wonderful new girl and we started dating. My current GF has mentioned that she has a problem with me going to do this out of state triathlon because my ex will be there. I have really enjoyed training and really want to go, and I absolutely do not want to see or talk to my ex. I can see where she is coming from, but at the same time, I signed up for it before I even met her and it was very expensive ($600). I've offered to have her come too, but that doesn't seem like it is an option. My GF tells me that if I go she feels like I am choosing me ex or going to this triathlon over her. I understand her feelings, but no amount of communication has lead to any kind of resolve. \n\nPart of me just wants to throw my hands into the air and just say fine, and not go. It would be the easiest route because I have a very busy grad school semester. But then I might resent her in the future for giving me, what I feel like, is an ultimatum.

At this point in my life I don't have any super close female friends. I'll list below who I have to choose from. Numbers don't really matter to me, but my FH will have 3 most likely.\n\nOld best friends: H and J- these two were my closest friends for about 7 years. Towards the end of college and within the past few years we kind of grew apart as we moved to different places, ect. We have stayed in touch and do see each other from time to time, but I just don't feel as close to them as I once did. (Side note: I was not chosen as a bridesmaid in J's wedding)\n\nCollege friend: CR- she is maybe the only person I feel confident in choosing at this point, but we haven't known each other that long and are not currently living in the same place. I have probably seen her the most in the past few years and she passes my arbitrary \"have I had a sleepover with this girl\" test.\n\nFH's sister: CL- I know this is kind of required, but for the sake of this discussion, I'll include her in here. Basically, I've only met her a handful of times and she's quite a bit younger than me (7 years).\n\nNew friends: E and S- ok first off, S is a guy, but he is probably the closest friend I have here in NYC. E is the only girl friend I really have here, but we're not really at the point where we would ever do things just the two of us. I think if both E & S were in my party it wouldn't be weird since we are part of a larger group of friends, but again, I have only known them for about a year and a half.\n\nMaybe this seems like a no brainer to someone on the outside, but I have been stressing out trying to put together the perfect combo of people. I'm also thinking of not have a clear \"maid of honor\" mostly because I don't know who would be one.\n\nAny and all help/advice is appreciated! :)\nTL;DR:"}

The relationship is pretty serious and, as of now, heading steadily towards that \"forever\" thing. \n\nI get back and start looking through the computer history to find a video I watched before leaving to visit family so I could send it to a friend. All I find are pages upon pages of what he went through while I was away. I know I shouldn't have but I looked through it anyway. It was tons and tons of porn. Don't get me wrong, I watch porn but not this much. I look further and find where he has spent hours browsing pictures of girls on facebook, which bothers me a tad since we actually know these people. There were also multiple chat conversations on pay to chat sites and even a few links where he looked into billing options for it. On top of that, he spent a significant amount of time browsing girls on OKCupid, which is actually how we initially met. \n\nI'm normally pretty easy-going and open-minded about things but this is really eating at me, especially since this is how he spends his time while I'm away. Am I the only thing keeping him from doing this more often or pursuing another option? I would normally just ask him about it since our communication is pretty excellent but I'm worried he would get defensive, leading to a fight. And even worse, I'm worried it would continue and he would just make more of an effort to hide his tracks, leaving me completely in the dark about the girls he is talking to. \n\nAnd as a bonus, many of the chats are for transvestite women.

Being about 11, maybe 12, I really wanted one as a souvenir commemorating that experience.\n \nThe shirt said, \"We did it,\" referring to the parasailing.\n\nI wore the shirt to school a few times when school started back, and didn't understand the snickering every time I wore it. It was just a shirt, right? Maybe not the coolest shirt ever, but soaring above the ocean was awesome.\n\nSo fast forward a few months later, and I was selected by my guidance counselor to attend a conference for young girls about abstinence. \n\nAt that conference, I got another shirt that said, \"I'm worth waiting for.\" Again, being so fucking innocent at the time, I wore that to school as well, proud that I'd been selected to represent my school at something and not  realizing that the guidance counselor selected me for that because of shirt #1.\n\nLater in life, I looked back on that, and put together why I developed a sort of \"bad\" reputation in middle school that I never understood.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by Going Offroad\nPOST: Hello TIFU readers, this is my first reddit post using this account. This fuck up actually happened yesterday between 10 and 11 AM.\n\nSo to start off with, my friends and I were in the beautiful island of Gozo. Us being tourists, did not know the way around the small island, so we resorted to a GPS. A friend of mine, just bought a car, an Opel Astra G to be precise. Great car, mint condition (up until yesterday). So basically I purchased this app on my mobile phone which has TomTom maps. I thought it would be a great opportunity to make use of this app. \n\nAt first all was plain sailing, little traffic, 'smooth' roads, beautiful view and quite peaceful. Then the GPS said we should go onto a narrow, unpaved side road. Through the side road, all seemed promising. We could already see our target location, it was a jaw dropping view, lots of greenery surrounded by blue sea. Now my fuck up began by selecting the wrong target location. Instead of selecting, the appropriate location, I tapped on a nearby medieval watch tower, thought that they would make use of the same road. \n\nSo what happened? As we travelled further the roads got rougher, more dangerous and more offroad-ish until we finally found ourselves in an open field, out of road. To be fair, my GPS stated that there was a road, clearly there wasn't, only fields with crops.\n\nObviously we had no other choice but to turn around and go all the way back. Here is the thing since the car is not cut off for offroad, it got stuck, we managed to get it out, by scraping the car's chassis, poor thing.\n\nEventually, we found our destined location, the promised land and 'enjoyed' the rest of the day.\n\nNow the car is in need of repair so we will see how that goes, the holiday ended up in a long guilt trip (from my pov).\nTL;DR:"}

Throughout pretty much the whole duration of our relationship I have been incredibly insecure, and have on many accounts checked his history to see exactly what he's looking at.  Typical OAG, I suppose, but mostly harmless.\n\nSince I was 18 when we first started dating, I grew to understand and be okay with the fact that porn happens.  Shit, I even enjoy it.  So in the last year or two I very openly laid down ground rules that I'm COMPLETELY fine with him looking at porn, so long as it isn't my friends, his friends, or someone he has contact with on a regular basis (this was a problem in the past.  Again, mostly innocent, I am 100% certain he has never cheated).  He seemed to be very on board, and things were going well.\n\nRecently I found pictures on his history again of a girl he works with, and I'll admit it's one of those \"she's gorgeous so of course im jealous and will automatically hate her\" type of things.\n\nSo my question:  do I bring it up (calmly and rationally)?  He will no doubt be angry that I've been snooping around in his history, but I feel like there will be more damage done if I set it aside and let it stew and grow into more hurt and anger.\nTL;DR:"}

I know the official recommendation is rear facing until age two, but I'm curious how often people stick with that advice, or make the decision to switch to front facing sooner in their child's case.\n\nMy guy's still fitting in his infant seat, and I wouldn't consider switching any time before one year, but I have friends who made the switch for their kids at that point.  I wasn't fully in the know about car seats when I was stocking up for baby (he's my first), so I have the rear facing infant seat for up to 35lbs / 32in, and a front facing convertible that goes up through booster seat stage, but I don't have an in-between.\n\nShould I bite the bullet and invest in a third seat, like the ones that go from rear to front facing / up to 70lbs? It would overlap with the two I already have, but offer that bit of functionality I'm missing. \n\nI know baby's safety is far more important than pinching pennies, but as someone without the experience I'm wondering if it's still common to switch to front facing earlier than two years (since he'll almost definitely outgrow his infant seat, lengthwise at least, before that point).\n\nAdvice from more experienced parents?\n\n(\nTL;DR:"}

I decided to cut my salary expectations down a bit and have been offered two jobs. They are both temporary options until I find something with better financial growth. \n\nThe first is pet sitting and dog walking. The nice thing about this is that I could keep it on the side once I found a full time gig. It pays $10.60 per half hour visit. I could get up to 20 visits a day plus the perk of being out and about and dealing with mainly animals and not people. I've verb told clients also like to tip and give gifts. So I'd have that going for me. Only issue here is that it's not guaranteed to be a full book all the time and I'd be an independent contractor. So I'd owe money come tax season. But the hours are flexible and I created a schedule around my daughters life so it's nice. \n\nThe second offer is at a convenience store. The hours are guaranteed full time but the schedule is awful. I'd have to find someone to take my kid to school every day and to watch her on the weekends for full days. No fun. It does have great benefits, but I've heard it's hard to grow there unless you know someone which I do not. It pays $10 per hour at 9 hour shifts. I've heard from many that is soul crushing and the customers can make or break your day. \n\nSo do I go with the one that's more risky but has more earning potential or the one that's \"safe\" but time and life consuming?\nTL;DR:"}

Things are going great and I have absolutely no intention of breaking up with him.\n\nToday in English class, Jeremy [not sure of his age, a few years older than me] asked me on a coffee date.

Glad I found this subreddit because I definitely could use some advice!\n\nBack story:\n\nFirst day of class, I really didn't know anyone there. This was also a sophomore level class, so looking around it seemed as if everyone already had their groups of friends. Here comes in said female, we'll call her **X**. I notice that **X** isn't talking to anyone, so I decided to sit down next to her and make friends with her.\n\nSkip a couple weeks, we are assigned a project, and she explains that she has been struggling on an aspect of it. I offer my help, get her number, and eventually help her figure it out. Hurray!\n\nPresent:\n\n**X** and I text every so often, but it is usually about the our respective course loads, and rarely starts going into other topics. We have casual conversations before and after class, but it is never lasts for that long.\n\nWhat I would like advice on:\n\nI'd like to ask **X** out on a coffee date or something of the like. I'd just really like to get to know her a bit more, outside of talking about our respective class load. How should I go about this? Should I bite the bullet and just call her up one day and ask if she wants to take a break from her work to get coffee, or bring it up in casual conversation before and after class? I hope to possibly turn this into a relationship, but I'm not entirely sure what my first step should be to take it from *friendly classmate* into dating her.\nTL;DR:"}

He told me recently he does yoga. At first, I thought that was cool. I like people who are active and enjoy doing things that are good for their body. Eventually he clarified that he goes to classes. With mostly, if not all women. This made me slightly uncomfortable at first but it was stupid self esteem issues so I didn't mention it. \n\nLast week he offered to take me to a free \"guest\" class. I wanted to go because he talks about yoga a lot. I went and I was really surprised. He was wearing a really tight outfit, as were all the women. I mean, his man parts were right there. The instructor was incredibly touchy and I just felt she crossed way too many boundaries. It wasn't for me and I didn't really see why he liked this, besides the obvious female interaction. \n\nI brought this up with him in a really light manner. Something like \"wow, they're really personal and friendly\". He didn't really get my point so I dropped it. Then yesterday, he told me he was going to a rave with a few people from the studio. Basically it was a rave without the drugs and partying. He explained it as an enlightening dance. I just picture people in dancing in a circle groping each other. \n\nThis is all too weird for me. I'm uncomfortable with the yoga, the package displays, the touching, the enlightening dances. It's not just a hobby or activity anymore. He's really into it. It's plastered all over his Facebook page. I don't know how to approach this with him without being so judgmental. I know I am being that way, especially because it's taking away a lot of his masculinity because of how he interacts with these people. He's just become very feminine. He doesn't act like he does when he's around me or his non-yoga friends. I don't like it.\nTL;DR:"}

I worked with them full time until August when I started College and had to switch to part-time work. My manager and I had agreed on a new schedule when I did start school.\n\nHowever, once school began I had spent a few weeks without working and I was under the assumption that I was waiting for the winter season (then the ski resorts open/biggest time of the year) for my new schedule to start. But I called up my boss in September asking if I was needed for increase in work, she informed me that they let me go and sent my papers into HR also under the assumption that I had decided to quit by not showing up and never formally telling anyone. I've never done this in the past so it seems odd. They did this all without uttering a word to me, my manager even has my cell that we've spoken over before and the Ast. Manager does too.\n\nThe day I found out I went and spoke to my manager and directly said that I never had the intention to quit and that I wanted to work but she told me that they already rehired my position and that they're fully staffed for the rest of the year. She also said they'll un-let-me-go and give me a call once a position in the Warehouse opens up. I really enjoyed the job and people I worked with so it's hard for me to know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

I have no regrets about this, and didn't feel jealous at all, or insecure during the act. We've been together for more than a year, and We had been discussing it for a while now anyway, so it all worked out just fine.\n\nShe gave me her phone number and I've texted her a little; turns out she's down to do it again, which I was excited about but not really in a hurry to do. I mean, it's only been 3 days.

But he's been talking about it a lot to me, and pushing me to hit her up again. I feel like 3 days is way too soon, and I want to wait a month or so.\n\nHe's just pissing me off because he keeps asking me, and at this point I'm just annoyed and tired of the subject. It sucks because I feel like we're lucky to have had it gone smoothly, and now his eagerness is rubbing me the wrong way because I hate to feel pressure sexually. \n\nIt's just making the whole thing leave a weird taste in my mouth, and even though I wasn't insecure about it at all, today I just feel like he's practically drooling over the idea of fucking this other girl. Can someone explain this logically to me or give me advice on how to chill about it? I just feel like it's become an obsession but I guess it *has* only just happened.\nTL;DR:"}

I've never been to New York and I was thinking I'd leave the airport and check out some of New York.  My question is when you're flying domestically like that (ORD to JFK) do your bags get checked all the way to the destination or do you have to do baggage claim (I think at O'Hare you have to claim and recheck your bags if you have a connection but I'm not sure if that's only when Chicago is your first entry point in the US) and recheck them? Also is it even worth it to try and go out and explore NYC for a little bit or is the TSA line going to take so long that I'll only get like 4 hours in the city.  This flight is $100 more than another flight I'm looking at that just has a layover in Berlin but that one is AirBerlin and I'm a Star Alliance member so I would ideally like to earn points on this flight.\nTL;DR:"}

We ended up just talking for two months before she came home from school.\n\nWe saw eachother all summer, went really well. When she had to go back to school we didn't really know what to do. We still liked eachother a lot, but both hesitant. So we decided to be in a relationship when she was at school.\n\nLong story short the timing wasn't great. We both like eachother a lot but we're at very different stages in our lives and a relationship just wasn't right. We made it over two months apart, but she started acting weird last week and dumped me on Sunday. But she couldn't let go and kept texting me.\n\nOriginally we just agreed to be friends, but after a few days we started talking about having sex again when she comes home over break. So basically at this point, the dynamic of our relationship is talking all day every day, still very sexual (or as sexual as you can be hours apart), but she doesn't want to date.\n\nSo is that basically an open relationship? I still want to hook up this winter and like talking to her, and I have accepted she may sleep with other people between now and then. We agreed to not ask eachother. But I know that first weekend night she goes out and doesn't text me back at bed time I'm gonna assume.\n\nTo be honest I've always been really insecure. Right now, i feel like I'd be ok with her screwing other dudes, whatever. But I really don't know.

This wasn't an average spill, I launched that shit into orbit. Glorious brown liquid spouting from the bottle (large, liter of liquid) everywhere like a fountain. A 2 meter wide diameter of sticky liquid covered the area around my desk. I have a tiny room so that's pretty much most of the room right there.\n\nThere was chocolate milk all over the walls and floor, in my hair and over my entire body and white computer chair, my bed, my monitor and my TV that's close to the desk (saved both), my controller and my speakers, the curtains and the heater, my headphones and my microphone. And, worst of all - it was all over the new keyboard and mouse combo I had been saving up for and purchased just a few months prior. A Func mechanical keyboard and a pretty fancy Zalman mouse, that are now both out of order.\n\nFor the first couple of seconds I couldn't help but sit and marvel at my moment of stupidity and the sheer damage such a simple thing caused. It took me two hours to clean it all up, saving most stuff, but not my keyboard and mouse. If anyone has any tips on how to clean computer peripherals let me know.\nTL;DR:"}

We also text (Only about school mainly!) during evenings and weekends.\n\nThe feeling kind of started when our class went out to a bar in 2nd year, we both had a bit to drink and went on the dance floor and were dancing closely for a while (too closely). I was enjoying myself and I'm sure she was as well, and when the song ended, nothing more was said or done that night. But that was when I started having some feelings.\n\nI figured the feelings would go away, but go ahead a year and a half and they are still definitely there. We still hang around each other at school all the time, and it's not because I feel in love with her. It's because I get along really well with her compared to others in the class, we're similar in our grades, and I genuinely care about her as a friend.\n\nI have no desire to pursue this in any way, but if someone has any advice on how to stop the \"love\" feeling it would be really helpful.

But when I woke up, I just opened my eyes and my whole body was shaking, I kept hearing the static noises from the game and the shaking was something like when you play with the machine that electrocutates you.\nTL;DR:"}

He has a roomate, but the roomate is 40 year old past cocaine user with absolutely horrible credit and a bad background check. \n\nThey just recently applied to move into a better apartment together, but while my Bf passed with flying colors, the roomate did not. Bf is determined to get out of the apartment he's currently living in as everything has been breaking the last couple months, like their AC and toilets. \n\nToday, Bf mentioned in a text how it is 'a shame I have no desire to move from my current situation.'  I currently live in a house my mother pays for with my brother and his girlfriend rent free.

Being so young, I should say I'm scared, I think?

Decided I'd go for a night run since I've been doing that at university. I stuck a head torch on, since I'm out in the countryside. \n\nDuring the day, my route (a winding bridleway through the countryside) looks [like this]  Pretty idyllic, right? Well, it turns out that in the pitch black, with none of the city lights I've gotten used to, it looks like [this]  Naturally, I pussied out and decided to take a detour down a shorter route that I usually use as a distance extension when I'm feeling like I still have some distance left in me. Its only about two miles but it goes through the town centre so theres lighting and, hey, better than nothing, right?\n\nSo I'm heading down this route idly thinking about a game called 'metro 2033' when my damp shoelace flicks up into the back of my leg. It was still dark because I hadn't got to the streetlights yet, and I instantly decided that one of [these things]  had leapt out of my nightmares and was attacking my calves. I squeaked a bit, jumped about 2 feet in the air and was almost sprinting for about 600 metres until I managed to get a grip.\n\nThings went a little less shittily when I reached the down centre (apart from the fact that i had a headlamp on in a thoroughly lit area and therefore looked like a complete twat to the Saturday night revellers) until I realised that it had only been 2 hours since my dinner (pulled pork in rolls with a kind of gravy sauce. I normally don't eat all day before a run but my mum made it as a treat and I could hardly say no) and it was starting to make a return on me. So I had to cut my short route even shorter and limp home.\nTL;DR:"}

It seems to be coming back.\n\nShe went on birth control (IUD (Mirena)) about 2-2.5 months ago, and started getting more emotional/moody about 1 month ago and it came to a peak when she had a panic attack about 2 weeks ago.

We think that her childhood trauma may be resurfacing and she ended up seeing a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with anxiety and depression (We live an hour apart so she went to that appointment alone, I'm not sure what else she might have been diagnosed with, and I'm also not sure if the doctor was aware that she was on birth control).  She was prescribed some type of benzodiazepines (not sure which one, but assume Xanax or Valium).\n\nShe wrote me a short letter yesterday about how she feels like change is coming and she wants to defeat her childhood trauma.\n\nI'm taking her to a basketball game tomorrow.  My question is, how do I support her? I want to be there for her, but she's been a bit distant since the beginning of the effects (about a month ago).  I don't know if I should give her distance or if I should let her know that she is loved and worth something (She's insecure in the sense that she thinks that she is just holding up people's time).

She's quiet and introverted, and I am too, so we're a good match. Last weekend, though, our 2nd date went awful. She's from a different city, has a strong accent and uses unusual phrases, and all this combined with my poor hearing meant I found it hard to understand her.

She didn't reply. But later on FB, she posted a couple of statuses that appeared directed at me, although she didn't write my name.

To go one step further, I honestly saw myself being engaged by then, but that isn't really as big of an issue.\n\nI don't know if I'm being ridiculous or not but I just think with him off in another state for 70% of the week, our relationship will be strained during a time when ideally I'd like it to be reaching a strong point.\n\nWhen he's mentioned his thoughts on the job I've brought up the whole \"but you'll gone all week and I won't see you :( :(\" spiel and he doesn't seem to think it's a big deal and that he'll be making a lot of money and we'll see each other on the weekends.\n\nI had a plan to bring it up more seriously with him today and figure out where he actually sees us being in two-years time but I'm wondering if maybe I'm overreacting about it. I know there are much worse things than only seeing your SO on the weekends but it just wasn't at all what I saw for us in the future.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [17 M] friend is in a complicated situation living in a toxic house he owns with no parents\nPOST: Let's begin with some background information about my friend, \"Kurt\". Kurt is currently 17, and has an 18 year old sister \"Natalia\" (relevant later) a younger sister and an older sister [19]. \n\nWhen Kurt was around 15 his parents broke up. He bounced between living with his father and his sisters and mother, without a real place to call home. When Kurt was 16 his father died suddenly from a heart attack, this hit him really hard and complicated his living arrangements. He didn't want to live with his mother, and his not-so-nice sister Natalia so his girlfriend and her family were kind enough to allow Kurt to live in their house. This worked, and Kurt got on well with his girlfriend's family, better than he got on with her. A few months later the relationship between Kurt and his girlfriend weakened and they broke up. He still lived his his now ex-girlfriend's family for a few months after the break up, which only soured the remainder of their relationship. This is now where things get complicated. \n\nKurt, Natalia and their mother bought a house. They all legally own this house, although K cannot technically do anything with the house because he is underage. Kurt, his sister Natalia and a roommate of Natalia live in this new house, his mother and younger sister live about 10km away. \n\nThe house is used as the 'party house' by O and all of her friends. They smoke, do drugs, party all night loudly and have no respect for the house or Kurt and make no attempt to keep the house clean. It is mentally and physically a toxic environment for him to be living in. Kurt most of the time shuts himself into his room, attempting to distance himself from the almost constant party. I'm personally unsure how bad this house is to live in, I haven't been there however a common friend has and didn't speak fondly of it. Kurt has almost finished secondary school and will be at the house more regularly.\n\nKurt has had a few rough years, and his living conditions aren't helping, what can he do?\nTL;DR:"}

The landlord even offered us a rent reduction to pay us back for lost income and property(though its spread out over a long period of time).\n\nThe problem is now we are finding mold growing on the wall of our bedroom (basement apartment).  We even had a couple mushroom sprout between the floor and the baseboard on the wall.  Our superintendent has been very helpful.  He has twice sprayed the parts of our apartment where the mold was growing.  But we have no idea how bad the situation is behind any of the walls.\n\nThe management company offered us another room in the building, but it is significantly smaller and the same price.  They said they can't do any mold investigation or removal while we are still in the apartment.  They won't let us occupy another apartment while ours is being fixed.\n\nThis is all in Bergen County, NJ.\n\nIs there anything we can do? We love our apartment and don't want to move out, but of course we can't live with mold.\nTL;DR:"}

I used a condom for sex, although she did perform oral sex on me, and I fingered her, both without any sort of protection.\n\nAfterwards, as someone who has grown up hearing about AIDS in Africa, I freaked out a bit. Within 48 hours, I went to the hospital and got post-exposure prophylaxis. When I told the doctor my story and why I wanted the PEP, she at first refused to give it to me, and asked if I needed a psychiatrist instead. Eventually, she gave me a mixture of Abacavir, Lamivudine, and Zidovudine, and I have been taking them as directed for the past week.\n\nI saw the girl again, and we got to talking. She seems to like me quite a bit, and asked if we could go to the health center together to get HIV tests to possibly avoid using a condom. Obviously, that is 100% out of the question, but I was impressed by the suggestion, which to me said she knows what's up.\n\nShe went on to tell me that she was in a monogmaous relationship with a Swede for 2 years up until 2 months ago. During this time, they each took the HIV test together, and had unprotected sex, and then once they broke up, she went to the health center by herself to have a final HIV test which turned up negative.\n\nBetween then and now, she's had sex with one other guy, and she says she used a condom. And like I said, each time that I have had sex with her, has been with a condom.\n\nBasically, the antivirals that I'm taking are destroying me with side effects.

She had an abortion last month because she thought he would end the relationship if she told him she was pregnant. She went through the whole process herself and he didn't care. \n\nIt is killing me to see her like this. She used to be a happy and confident woman, but now...she's convinced she's worthless, ugly, has no future, etc etc. I fucking hate this guy for what he's done to her. They are apparently \"on a break\" right now, but she hopes they will get back together...even though he's dating some girl he met on Tinder. Seriously.

However, since the day we've been in the apartment there has been a huge tarp covering the entire deck, along with extra superfluous tarps randomly left around. In addition, the deck itself is starting to degrade in quality (loose boards etc etc). We were told that the roof was leaking and that's why the tarp was needed and that the whole deck would be replaced. Long story short, it hasn't happened and we keep getting delayed estimates. We were wondering if there's any legal action we could take to either force them to do it earlier or reduce our rent. We live in Boston.\nTL;DR:"}

I am a huge animal and more specifically dog lover. my brother tonight asked if i would take his dog of 7 years who i absolutely love and is huge. part wolfhound. \n\nNow the problem is that i live with my girlfriend in an already too small house for us. about 750sf. We already have a 60 pound dog who is high energy and needs lots of attention. So it would be a huge change for us to take him in. I really dont want to take him, but if it came down to it i would have to. He is family! \n\nI really dont know what to do. my brother doesnt want him anymore. he is the sweetest dog and mostly behaved. his biggest complaint is that he rips of the kids stuffed animals and runs away if let out the front door. In the last two years my brother has met his wife, got married, and has two kids. I realize times are stressful, but i also feel like they should take care of the dog for it's entire life. I know if i take it or if he gives it away I will resent him for it. I also dont think his wife loves the dog very much. This dog has been loyal for 7 years and he's just going to get rid of him. It breaks my heart and makes me cry just thinking about it.\nTL;DR:"}

Ever since then, the whole neighborhood has turned from a well knit, happy community, to one that avoids that one specific household.  \n\nWhy you may ask? I won't speak for others, but these will be my experiences I have had with her.  \n\n1. Apparently I speed down the road? Ok, I will take fault if I do speed, but I always make sure i'm going down my street less than speed limit as there are quite a few kids who play on the street. One time, she decides I was going WAY over the speed limit and jumps right in front of me to yell at me. I stop, she comes to my window and proceeds to yell at me. I just ignore her and continue on home. She runs towards my house and starts swearing at me. My surrounding neighbors hear the commotion, and she began to walk back to her house.   \n2. She doesn't mind her own business. This is a long one. So for starters, I work on my car in my garage, and one time, she had the guts to come up to my driveway in the middle of the day and yell at me and tell me I was being obnoxious working on my car, and that it was illegal. She calls police, the cops come and tell her to go away laughing. Other times, she will walk by my house completely staring down at me or something, which is annoying. Another thing is, when I go to walk/run/bike around the neighborhood, she always stares at me like i'm some god damn crook. Okay. I sometimes stare back as a F you type deal, but sometimes shes like \"F** ARE YOU LOOKIN AT HOMEBOY\". I either leave it alone or flip her off and just kept walking.\nTL;DR:"}

The issue here is that i'm living at home and my father initially agreed (with hesitation) for her to stay with us for until September. Now that its September this are a bit messier.\n\nInitially, our plans were to move out together come September- I was shortlisted for a really good job and moving out was conditional on me getting it- and she was to stay with us for the summer to save money. She was previously living with a room-mate and working part-time while in school so both my dad and I wanted to help her out by giving her a break financially (plus she was over at my place alot anyways).\n\nSo needless to say, I didn't get the job and I am currently unemployed and graduating. She was hired last month full-time making $30/hour (she is also still in school until December). My father is very traditional so he would prefer living with just me, but he sees that she makes me happy so he can live with her here.\n\nThe problem-> my father doesn't want to ask her for rent money or to kick her out, but he does deep down. Her financial situation has changed since  moving in so it seems fair that she pay my father but I feel like it would be awkward for all parties involved (especially since I wouldn't be paying rent).\n\nShe is up for moving out with me, but to me it wouldn't make sense (I have money saved up but to me it would be wasteful given that I have a free place to stay and no job).\n\nHow should I approach this so that everyone involved is happy?\nWhat are your personal experiences with this?\nTL;DR:"}

I also want to add that he never once referred to himself or his personal feelings about weddings, always talking about it in reference to other people. Kind of weird. Made me wonder if it might be on his mind?\n\nFor example, talk about a project he is working on ended up in a story about a particularly awesome, nerdy wedding that he thought was hilarious and amazing. He would also do things like bring up recent weddings of friends, or tell me that so and so has a wife, ect.\n\nHe and I have a very very strong, passionate connection that is like best friends + playmates + awesome amazing sex. It's kind of perfect. But he has never once told me how he feels about marriage, not seeming like the marrying \"type\", although he has \"joked\" about marrying me before. I say \"joked\" because he could of been serious, but I assumed it was a joke because I was too shy to ask or think otherwise. \n\nI don't know. Maybe I am looking to deeply into it. He doesn't really seem to be hinting at anything, as far as I can tell, but maybe guys do this sort of thing when they are thinking about it but don't feel comfortable enough to talk about it?\n\nAnyway, any insight is welcome.\n\nAnd for the record, I would totally marry him.

I finally found one and was able to look inside the home by a construction worker that was doing some repairs on a home. I went to the rental company told them I liked the place and was interested in renting it. Well, I signed the lease on March 24th that went into effect on April 1st. I got the keys on March 31st. I went to the house, looked around and inside at everything and then I noticed in the A/C unit that there was tons of mildew, rotted boards, and black mold. I called the landlord and he asked me to send him pictures over text message. So, I did and he said he would notify the owners. Well, I moved a lot of my stuff over to the house but haven't been living there because I still have an apartment and I wanted that mold issue fixed. I e-mailed him against last Friday and he said it would be taken care of Monday (4-27-15). I went to the house today (4-28-15) and all they did was paint over the mold and rotted boards. They just remodeled the entire house. Meaning, they painted all the walls, put down new laminate flooring, new stove, new sinks, new refridgerator, and new toilets. After seeing the mold around the A/C unit, I'm afraid the entire house might be covered in the mold and they just covered it up and that it's probably not safe to live there.\n\nIs it possible for me to break this lease based on unsafe living conditions?

I was exited, and she seemed happy to see me as well. We got to talking and things seem to have been back to normal. Ever since we have been texting periodically but two problems \n1. I have always texted first.\n2. I am socially awkward and have a hard time keeping conversations going, so the texting would sometimes just stop\nEver since seeing her again it reminded me of how great she is, and the crush has come back.

I don't think he realizes just how loud his music really is. If I can hear his music through a concrete floor... then it's too loud. It fills the hallway and the stairwell. I'm not asking him to turn it off... just turn it down. I have work I'm doing in my apt and I don't understand how he doesn't respect that. I feel like even if I message him, he just ignores it now. What can I do? I'm not trying to be a killjoy or a bitch... but it's an apt... Other people live here too. I would imagine that after so many times of asking him, he would realize that he's really too loud. It's usually just during the day and I don't have too many problems with it at night.

But for what. After losing only 4 pounds in 4 months, its a little upsetting and frustrating because i truly feel i should weigh much less then this. It's upsetting to know that i went from eating whatever i want, to being miserable watching everything i eat all day every day for no reason. \n\nI'm considering Jenny Craig and even considering getting these crave cutting shots someone i know is getting.

About 7 months ago she moved out to a city that is about an hour away from where I live by train/subway (we previously lived 15 min from each other by car). Because of this we can only really see each other on weekends.\n\nThe amount we see each other has always been a big point of contention for her. I am her first real relationship, but before her I was in a LDR so I'm used to the whole rarely seeing each other thing. Currently we see each other almost every weekend because we both love to ski and always ski together- her parents have a little condo near a mountain, so we'll spend the weekend together. However, before the winter there would be some weekends where I needed a relaxing do-nothing weekend, or I had other plans that prevented me from coming to see her. She was NOT OK with that and it caused fights, and was often brought up in other discussions. Really, as soon as we started seeing each other nearly every weekend in the winter things have been peachy.\n\nNow I'm starting a project that I fear will bring back the same fights. I've always wanted to build and race my own racecar and I've finally gotten together the cash to do so in a small way (autocross), but I know how much time it will take up and it's mainly on the weekends. I've warned her of this and while she stated she supports me in my passion she also stated that if she does not see me because of this project she will not be happy. She didn't say we will fight but I understood what she was implying.  \n\nSo Reddit, what do I do? Am I an ass for not feeling the same way about seeing each other as she does?

Couldn't really focus on what our driver was saying or anything really. Walking back to our room was difficult, as we needed support from leaning on things to make it back.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/GetMotivated\nTITLE: That moose moment.\nPOST: Two years ago I was driving home, just after sunset, with my three kids in the backseat of my car. Driving through a wooded section of road I had seen several deer standing beside the road and was keeping any eye out for them. They were easy to spot because of the tan color. Coming around a turn I saw a huge mass suddenly appear in front of my headlights. It was a huge moose with a full rack. What I remember from that point was like a slide show with associated thoughts. \n\nSlide 1 Moose running in front car and trying to turn around. My thought process, Oh Crap that's a moose!\n\nSlide 2 Hitting brakes. My thoughts included the realization that I am going to hit this moose, quickly remembering that I have seen on mythbusters what happens when a car hits a moose.\n\nSlide 3 Hitting the moose in the back legs it sits down on the hood of car and rolls towards me. This is the moment I remember thinking, \"so this is how I die, I never would have guessed' and remember praying that my body would stop the moose before it hit my kids in the back seat.\n\nSlide 4 Moose hits windshield and fills my view. No my life did not flash before my eyes, but I do remember thinking or feeling that I was ok with what I had done with my life, no regrets.\n\nSlide 5 The windshield is cracked but held together and the moose has rolled up on to the roof. At that point my only thought was \"huh\", because I did not expect to still be alive or at least not have a moose in my lap.\n\nLater on when I was having the windshield replaced I was told that the original windshield had been installed wrong and the only thing holding it in was the weight of the glass and air pressure.\n\nThe biggest thing I learned from the moose, is that at any moment our lives can come to an end. You may not have tomorrow, the only time you are guaranteed is the moment you have now. Everyone should have a moose moment it will really change your perception of things.\nTL;DR:"}

In my professional experience as a personal injury attorney, that's simply not true.\n\nTort reform is a product of insurance company lobbyists.  People need to realize this.  \n\nThis is my premise:  If you can sue a doctor, hospital or third party for injury or wrongful death and obtain a jury verdict against that person for millions of dollars, you probably deserve it.  Why?  Because you were actually hurt by this person and the jury recognizes that.  There is nothing about limiting the amount of a verdict that can possibly be good for our society.  Juries, by the large, don't award large sums of money to people who aren't hurt, instead they find against them and plaintiffs owe costs to the defendants.\n\nIt is extremely difficult and expensive to litigate most medical based matters.  Try this:  Go to an attorney and give them a factual scenario that you believe is both bogus and commonly litigated.  Ask this attorney if he or she will litigate for you on their dime.  I guarantee they won't.  Most medical malpractice actions cost absurd amounts of money to get the ball rolling.  There are very few attorneys who are going to repeatedly throw large sums of money in the trash and risk their bar license to litigate bogus claims.  Why?  When you have bogus facts, you are going to lose at trial, EVERY SINGLE TIME.\nTL;DR:"}

Do I tell my friend?\nPOST: I have always been a lurker on reddit, so I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place, but anyway, I really need advice! \n\nWhen I was younger I always slept at my best friends house, and a couple of times I woke up to find her dad was touching me inappropriately. I never acknowledged him, just rolled onto my stomach and tried to get back to sleep. \n\nI never told anyone, and I think I was just so ashamed and I was afraid I might ruin my best friend's life. I never even told my parents, because I know they would have gone to the dad and flipped out. I just kept it a deep dark secret and stopped hanging out with my friend. The poor girl never knew why we stopped hanging out, but I just couldn't see her anymore.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I met a girl who also spent a lot of time with my ex-best friend, and she got drunk and mentioned that the dad was creepy. I pushed and pushed her to explain what she meant, and she eventually described the EXACT same situation to me. She had also experienced my old friend's dad molesting her. I don't know why, but it was like a weight lifting from my shoulders. The shame went away and I could really talk to my family and close friends about my past experience. It wasn't just me and this guy was just a pedophile. \n\nBut now my ex-best friend has a 5 year old daughter. And I feel almost responsible to protect her. My friend never did anything wrong, we just stopped being friends because I couldn't face her. But this might turn into a vicious cycle, where her daughter brings friends around and loses friends and doesn't understand why. I see pictures of her posted online and I feel so guilty. \n\nSo, do I tell? What should I do? I just can't do nothing, can I?\nTL;DR:"}

Do I have legal grounds to fight it?\nPOST: I was seen on 11/28/2011 for a concussion at a hospital in Indiana while I was attending school there. During my visit I was handed a single form, which I filled out in its entirety. Upon being treated I left without being asked for any more information and then was never contacted in any way regarding billing, so I assumed that I had given my insurance information on the form and everything had been covered. \n\nJune of 2013 I checked my credit score and noticed a strange company listed--I looked it up and it turned out to be a debt collector, who also had never tried to contact me. They informed me that I owe $1600 even though I was never contacted or given an official bill. Not only could they not provide an original bill, they couldn't provide me with the original hospital I saw. They claimed the hospital hadn't had enough information to contact me, even though I filled out the only form that I was given. If that form didn't have enough information, why wasn't I given a more comprehensive form so that the hospital would have the appropriate amount of information?\n\nAccording to the collections agency, the hospital had turned the bill to collections on 1/11/12, which is about a month and a half after my visit. I didn't think they could put a bill in collections so quickly, I thought they had to wait a certain amount of time before doing so. \n\nDo I have any legal grounds to fight the bill? I don't even live in Indiana anymore, I'm in Arizona, which was my forwarding address at my college so if they had sent something there I still would have gotten it.\n\nAccording to the collectors there was no insurance information filed, so they billed me as uninsured. My insurance company would have easily covered the visit, but I'm sure it's much too late to file a claim with them now.\nTL;DR:"}

I fully support what she does, taking care of the minors who've been pulled out of bad situations and trying to give them another chance in a better environment. She takes her job very seriously, and will without hesitation push me to the side (I know not intentionally), or may do a few things to make them more comfortable but makes us more stressed.\n\nIt takes a huge emotional toll on her. I've seen her get attached to many of the children, cry and go into a depressive state when they leave, and the cycle seems to repeat. She's a very emotional and compassionate person, which is a reason why she took the job, but I don't really think it's in her best interest (or emotionally healthy) for her to allow herself to become attached like that and then fall into depression until the next kids come. \n\nWe still spend time together, and she talks about taking the relationship to the \"next level\", but I feel like if we're going to start becoming more serious I want her to consider something...giving up fostering. So we can focus more on the relationship.\n\nI suggested this to her and she gave me the most disbelieved face, which was replaced with by far one of the most angry faces I've seen her give me. She told me I can't just expect her to give up something so important to her, and I'm starting to feel guilty, because I know she's probably right. But I just want to spend time alone with my girlfriend, I want her all to myself. I know it sounds selfish but it's the truth. \n\nRight now there are 3 teenagers, and 2 toddlers that are with her, and by the time she gets around to me she already seems too emotionally drained for anything...\nTL;DR:"}

This one is about kids. I (25m) have been with my wife (25f) for only a year, but it's important to think ahead.\n\nWe both have clearly agreed that we aren't yet ready, and won't be for years. l know she definitely wants them at some point. I grew up under the impression that I would marry and have kids, it's just what you do. And we went through the course of our relationship understanding that we would have them someday. Since being married, I feel like the idea of having kids gets farther and father away from my vision of the future, whenever I think about it. It feels horrible that my idea about something like this may have changed.\n\nOne of the big worries that I have is that I will inevitably delay my decision to have kids until it doesn't happen and we move on or it accidentally happens and I have to accept it. Nobody is ever ready, and I hear all the time that it ends up being the best thing to happen to them. Yet, it's not just me not being \"ready.\" I'm terrified of the thought.  l fear that neither of us are mentally fit for a child. I'm uncomfortable around kids, from age 0 to 14 or older. l don't have any sort of instinctual drive to carry on my family name.  The way that we handle rough times now (and we've had a lot) makes me seriously fear raising anything more then a dog.\n\nAre these normal fears for young couple that doesn't want kids *yet*?

I've tried really hard to stop it from bothering me, as I'm not the jealous type at all. It hasn't been a major problem until last week \n\nWhen with a group of friends, he went through my phone and read my messages. He then started questioning me on \"who's this? Why are you messaging him so late?\" And I was mortified. He embarrassed me so much in front of everyone, and he made his jealousy everyone's problem. I left immediately, and we had a conversation about boundaries and privacy\n\nEver since then, I've felt different. It caused alarm bells to ring in my head! He's texted me when I've gone out telling me to \"be careful\" and to \"not let other men hit on me\" and it's a very ugly quality in him I don't like. I told him his jealous is pushing me away, and he says he's terrified of causing issues between us and wants to change \n\nI've also started to get feelings for another guy, although he's a lot older then me and I don't think anything will come of it, just the fact I've started to get strong feelings for someone else for the first time in our relationship is causing me real problems\n\nI care about him so much, but I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore. I don't know how I'd be without a boyfriend, as I've never really been without. I'd like to also add I'm going to university in September, so that is also going to add strain and possibly make his jealousy worse. I don't know whether or not to end it now, or wait it out and see if he changes or I feel differently\nTL;DR:"}

I've started seeing some sides of him I don't like, but I still love him.  I'm not sure if I want to be with him, but I do care deeply about him.  Which is why I'm so upset about myself for what happened last night.  I ended up having sex with a guy ten years older than me.  I found him insanely attractive and was very drunk, and it just happened.  It didn't help that my boyfriend and I had gotten into a fight earlier and he left without saying goodbye to me.  Obviously that is not an excuse for my actions.  \n\nI really don't know what to do though... my roommates know and I'm sure they think I'm a slutty, disgusting person and I'm sure they hate me now.  My boyfriend does not know and I don't think I want to tell him.  I know that he would hate me and break up with me and never ever forgive me.  I just feel so guilty and terrible and I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

Fast foward to 2011, i'm starting my applications for fall 2012 transfer. I'm intending on studying EE, since it's still somewhat connected to my profession now but still broad enough to open plenty of other doors. \n\nI aced physics 2 (electricity and magnetism), but it didn't interest me in one bit. I barely went to class, and just went over problems the night before the tests. What I do love is just plain ol math. I've always said if I was younger, I'd be a math major and go for the PHD. The only reason I'm going for engineering is kind of a safety net. I've done IT for 6 years now professionally so I have professional experience (in the event I say fuck it with school and i'll just go find a good paying corporate IT job). OR I can get an engineering degree and get an entry level engineering job and move up the ranks. I only chose engineering as it seemed like it's the only degree out there that one could get a decent paying job with only their bachelors.\n\nNow having gone through the entire physics courses, I hate it. I love the concepts and why things work, but just the coursework was a bore. I find just straight up math much more endearing. Linear Algebra was tight as fuck. I romanticize the day I work for the NSA, building components for a radar jammer, but in reality I'll probably be overlooking a manufacturing plant making stupid little bluetooth headsets or something.\nTL;DR:"}

A place like this leads to fun parties after work, and a lot of friends. \n\nI started dating a colleague, which of course spread through the workplace, I think we saw eachother for a month or so, before we decided it didn't work out.

I live with one of my colleagues from that job, and I regularly see some of them all.\n\nHere is the hazzle. Shortly after I left, this new, astonishingly beautiful and sweet girl started, lets call her Carla. One of my ex-dates friends. I really want to date her (or atleast talk to her), I know she is single and is currently having a boring life (her own words to my roomie) so I know there is room for me to fit in her schedule too. She knows who I am, especially cause I slept with her friend over a months course, and that is a common joke still - but we haven't actually met. I don't meet Lisa anymore, but we are 'friends'. There is no way of getting her to introduce me (which is also a bit weird in our circle of friends), I can't casually add her on facebook or anything, and also, I have no clue if the chances of me getting to know her are ZERO due to me and Lisa, or if she is not bothered by it. Roomie tells me she is picky and that is why she is not seeing anyone, or haven't for a while, but that he thinks I can go for it - IF I find an appropriate way to meet her.\n\nAny way to spontaneously meet a girl on purpose, for the sake of getting to know her, without her knowing you really want to date her?\nTL;DR:"}

A friend of mine brought his boston terrier over and after introducing them slowly, they ended up playing together in the snow for almost an hour. I've had him for a week, and I've already thought him a few tricks.\n\nThe problem is, everytime I leave the house, he becomes destructive. I tried keeping him in the basement with his toys, but he was able to climb through or jump over every gate I used. He is an escape artist. I also left him by himself in the house a few times to try it out, but he destroyed tissue boxes, sponges, bags and curtains. Just me taking a shower is enough for him to go through a few garbage bins around the house. Today, he was able to get the fish food off the top shelf and he ate it all.\n\nHow can I make sure he stays calm and chews on his toys while I am gone? I feel like I am doing something wrong, or maybe he is scared.\n\nHe is a 3.5 years old lab mix and he is very small.

But, he's supposed to be going out with some girl he met through tinder this week and it is making me nauseous thinking about it. I'm afraid to say something to him. If he doesn't feel the same way about me, it will make for an awkward remaining 9 months on our lease. Plus if he doesn't feel the same, I don't know how that would change anything, its not like he won't still go out with other girls. And I can't move out early, I've moved 4 times in the past 2 years and I really need to stay in one place for a year. \n\nAdvice would be greatly appreciated. I'm uncomfortable with tinder so I can't really see myself doing that as a distraction.

We're both strongly pro-choice but she seems very inclined to keep it. She's told me that I'm free to leave if I don't want to be involved and that she'd care for it independently.

I'm also not sure though that this is someone I want to be with my entire life, or if we would have a stable and healthy relationship for the child. So far it's been great and we've said I love you to one another (and meant it) but no matter how intense things have been I wouldn't have expected this decisions at six weeks.\n\nFinancially it's feasible as we both make good money but I wouldn't have done it for at least a few years if I had the choice.

How over is it?\nPOST: This girl (we'll call her Liz) and I have known each other for almost 4-5 years now, and have been flirty but good friends the entire time.  When I first met her, I was in an LTR and she (despite being attractive) was way too young to date. I could tell she really liked me so I kept in touch you know, just to keep that candle lit in case things went bad with my gf. (this sounds worse than it is.. I wasn't like dating her behind my gf's back or anything, we were just good friends.)\n\nWell things inevitably did go bad with the LTR, and I've been single for a while now but up until lately haven't been ready to date.  Liz and I had hung out here and there, actually she pulled me away to make out on two occassions at parties I invited her to (even as recently as December 2012) so I could tell there was still something there.\n\nAnd so I've been thinking about it a lot, trying to debate whether I wanted to date someone that young and finally last night I laid it all out to her via texting.  I asked her what she thought of me and dating me and her reply was that in the last few weeks she started talking to someone else, and that she had liked me for a long, long time but didn't think I liked her back so she moved on.  Also that she likes our relationship how it is now.  \n\nWell i was stunned but not too surprised, kind of my fault for never taking the initiative, but my question is this:\n\nHow over is it really?  When girls finally decide enough is enough and they move on is that permanent friend zone level?  I'm kind of assuming if we ever both become single again we might be able to get together but I want to see what Reddit has to say about it.\nTL;DR:"}

It was a very terrible situation and they were very close, hence my girlfriend is understandably having a very difficult time. I am doing my best to be there for her emotionally and physically (we are long distance and see each other every 2-3 weeks). Lately it seems that I am at a loss for words sometimes. She'll have a particularly bad day, and I'll tell her that I am sorry and ask her to tell me about it, but all I really know to say is stupid stuff like \"in time this will get better\" and things along those lines. I've never really been in a position before in my life where I have to be so sympathetic, and I really do care about the situation and my girlfriend, but I am just having trouble expressing my emotions. We are starting to fight because she says I'm the one person who should be there for her and I'm not, and it's really killing my self esteem because I know that I'm doing a poor job even though I do really love her.

He text me after it happened, I work nights, and he couldn't sleep he said that's the worst thing he's ever seen me being upset like that and he's so sorry. I told him again he'd done nothing wrong and please don't apologise, and that my reaction was just shock, I wasn't upset with him at all.\n\nAlso, it does feel a little sore still, almost like I'm bruised inside, I'm not so worried about that as I can go to the doctors if it stays sore, or if it ever happens again.

We've kept in touch during this time, and she knows how I feel about her (well, somewhat. She knows I have feelings for her, but doesn't quite know the extent to which I'm in love with her). The truth is, I've never felt this way about someone before and I sincerely feel like she is *the girl* for me. I also get the sense she feels similarly.\n\nFor about the past 6 months, I've been in contact with a new brewery that wants me to serve as their VP of sales and distribution. However, that opportunity seems unlikely now that the brewery is experiencing some initial troubles getting opened. Until this recent development, I've been extremely excited about moving to Seattle, being in the same city as her, and then seeing where things end up - all while not having to force her hand and ask explicitly if she harbors the same feelings as me.\n\nThat being said, with this new news, I'm still wondering if I should search for employment out in Seattle. It's highly unlikely I'll find an opportunity out there as enticing as my previous prospect, so I would like to know if there's a chance of things working out between us before I make a serious commitment to move.\n\nWhich brings me to my question.

We get there and she immediately introduces me to her best friend[21F] that my friends have just referred to as the Sasha Grey look alike. My crush starts dancing with a random guy and her friend tries to dance with me, but I decline since it would not be a good idea to show interest in my crush's best friend and I \"left to find my friends\" (I just went for a walk and told my friend about my predicament).\n\nWe get back and my crush and her friend got mad at me for leaving them and we went for some late night food.

I told her that I would if my crush is coming.\n\nI asked my crush to dinner today, and she said that she had to work, so it wouldnt work. I then asked her about tomorrow and she said that she might be visiting her family, but if not, then she would. Now she is going to see her family. I have to ask her out before next Sunday if I ever want to date her, because my roommate is gone until then and he will stop at no length to keep me from dating one of his friends.\n\nHer best friend is gorgeous, but so is my crush and she is one of the most kind hearted, funny people I know.\n\nShould I ask her to dinner again some time this week and tell her how I feel, or should I give up and move on?

I was only there from 7am-8am and they only thing they did was run a test on my urine to determine what antibiotics I needed. I came in promptly at 7 and left promptly at 8, went to a pharmacy, bought my medication (of the three they prescribed I only needed one) and went home. Since then I have received several hospital bills and most of them have a different charge on them than the others (the first was $300 and something and every one thereafter has been $800 and above but usually not the same amount). I'm a college student who doesn't have insurance and cannot get financial help outside of my job and loans (very small loans). The latest hospital bill I received states that I was in their hospital from 10pm the night before until 8am that morning. So my question is, can I sue for this? I planned to pay them back when I financially could but now that I have all of these random bills and now this one that is just false I don't know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been dating with my now ex girlfriend for three years since we were seniors in Highschool. We were on and off with the distance since she went nearly 500 miles away for college, both of us never had another relationship in the mean time, we would hook up when we weren't together. \n\nThis year when we decided to date again instead of just hooking up between school breaks we decided we would make more effort( this was mostly on my end, imo) to strengthen things. The distance sucked. When we were together everything was great. When she went back to school I would always just think that things weren't good between us and I don't know why, like I couldn't give her enough emotionally. I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression from school this year also. \n\nI finally decided that she was such a sweet and loving girl that I really couldn't reciprocate what she was giving me, and that she deserved to find someone that could treat her better and broke things off. I definitely know that I love her, and she is crazy about me. I'm young and I've been in love once with my first girlfriend(I was 16), but I don't feel the same this time around and this relationship has been 2 years longer. I don't know if I'm supposed to feel more or if this was right or if that prior relationship was a first love thing.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I have (what I think is) a great idea. I wanted Reddit's help/advice in bringing it to fruition.\nPOST: Basically, my idea is this. A lot of people in the world are employed at a level where they have slightly more than enough money to get by, but not enough to puruse their dreams, buy anything extravagant, go wild with spending etc.  \nI thought it would be cool to set up a kind of 'community lottery' project. Collect signups from a thousand people, and every week the members would contribute a dollar into a 'pot'. We then randomly select a participant, and that person is awarded with the thousand dollar pot.  \nAt only a dollar a week, that's only fifty two dollars a year - probably more than affordable for most people. And with the chance of being gifted a thousand dollars - I feel that's a substantial enough amount of money to make someone's week feel pretty awesome.  \nI wanted your guys' help because I realize there are a huge amount of logistical problems with setting something like this up. Ensuring a regular payment schedule from each participant doesn't waiver... finding a reliable way to collect funds in the first place... impartially judging the random selection for each week... all those and a host of others. I think it's a cool idea in and of itself; a way to donate a dollar a week to make another person in the world extremely happy, with a chance to wind up with a thousand dollars for yourself.  \nSo basically, I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions on how to make this work. The complete list of problems as I see it;  \n* **Ensuring authenticity of the program (eg. making sure people can guarantee it's not just a way for me to take their money and vanish)**  \n* **Ensuring a reliable method of regular payment - making sure that people feel their money is safe and going to the right place**  \n* **Setting up an impartial manner in which to judge the winner for each week**  \n* **Just in general, ironing out kinks in the system - would be more evident if I had done something like this before...**  \n\nSo... what do you guys think? Is this doable? Suggestions?\nTL;DR:"}

My bowels decided to howl and churn just as I passed the last exit to civilization there would be for another 20 miles. After a few minutes of holding it in, of course, I snapped and decided to pull over to try to find a nice patch of grass behind my car to gush my lava.

We've had our ups and downs, but all in all our relationship is great and we're really happy with each other. We live together too which is great. \n\nThere's only one thing that bothers me.\n\nMainly it's that my boyfriend is super into 'assholes'. I'll admit I can be a dick at times and that's one of the main things that drew him to me (his words, not mine). \n\nI don't mind acting like that. It turns him on and is what I'm used to doing anyway. The issue is, he's pretty insecure, with a lot of ghosts in his past, anxiety, depression and other problems. I really love him so I've done my best to work through that stuff with him, and it's really paid off. He's started to come out of his shell and socialize, which he never used to before. Thing is, when I help him with this stuff by necessity I have to be nice and tolerant (for example, not jokey about his quirks like I am usually). And I don't mind doing it. \n\nBut I've noticed he really acts less interested during those times - his libido's lower, he gets annoyed at me more easily, etc. I don't like that. The moment I get back to teasing him and being a dick he goes back to his usual lovey-dovey self.\n\nI guess overall I'm wondering whether I should act nice to help him overcome his issues at the risk of him getting cold with me, or continue acting how I'm used to.\n\nI don't want to be abusive or take advantage of his insecurities but it really seems like it's what he wants sexually/romantically. But at the same time I don't want him to be struggling with his issues forever. It can make him really clingy sometimes. \n\nI'm supporting us until he gets a job, and I'd get him a therapist for that stuff but it's not something I can really afford right now.\nTL;DR:"}

After about five minutes of that, my room mate replied that there is no way I would believe that if I had ever had a loved one die of cancer. This time I got the hint.\n\nNot.

I understand that attraction to other people is perfectly normal; however this is not something that has happened often to me before whilst in this relationship.\n\nSome context regarding the relationship: We do not have sex regularly anymore. This is a culmination of many things for which we are both at fault. We have not had sex for over a month at this point. My partner recently lost his job and is now home all of the time, usually playing games. I must admit that I do feel like he could be doing more to find work \u2013 he has experience in IT and I know that there are positions going. I think that my feelings stem from wanting freedom. I am a person who prefers alone time and solidarity. I am scared that these feeling of resentment may not fade?

I'm looking for a little bit of advice. \n\nRecently, I've been talking to a 30 year old college grad. (We'll call him B).\n\nWe're friends on Facebook, and I, feeling silly, posted one of those To Be Honest status on Facebook. He, to my surprise, liked it so I honestly told him I'd like to get to know him better.\n\nHe responded positively, stating that we should meet up sometime and gave me his number. \n\nI, being a young, inexperienced in dating 21 year old, got really excited and we've been texting a little ever since.\n\nOver the course of our conversation, he said that we definitely need to meet up and we'll work something out. This weekend's a no-go, because I'll be out of town on Saturday and the Super Bowl's on Sunday. I also learned that he isn't seeing anyone at the moment and he asked of my status as well.\n\nI think he's showing interest by asking these things, but then again, I'm young and not really experienced in dating. My last 'relationship' was an emotionally abusive one, and it was long distance.\n\nAlso, I know I'm a clingy texter, but I really don't want to come off that way to this guy, especially me being this young. I don't want to seem like a \"little girl,\" to him. I'm going to try to see if he'll say hi tomorrow.\n\nI really don't know him too well yet, but he's very smart, very handsome young man on his way to get his PHD. I'm still an undergrad who's unsure what to do with my life and degree. My mom thinks I should pursue this, I just don't know how.\nTL;DR:"}

After NYE, day 2 of 2015, after 5 days without even texting me, she says she wants to break up with me and I ask why and she doesn't want to answer. After a lot of questions, she finally admits that she got drunk in a party and kissed another guy there.\n\nI just say to her that it's okay, I can forgive her since I really love this girl but we are going to get through a LOT of conversations and \"therapy\" to go back to what we were...She says she doesn't want to \nbe with me anymore and won't respond my texts.\n\nAll I am asking to her is to talk to me, explain why, have a \"nice\" break up, not just a text like \"it's over\" after three years that we are together, I say to her that it's not fair and to not worry about cheating, we can talk about this, but she didn't answer anymore and blocked my number. Not before I text her that if she is going to ignore me, I will go to her house as soon she gets home.\n\nWhat I want to know is: I am being a idiot for acting like this? I never thought I could forgive cheating, like she did, but I love her so much that I'm willing to get through this. And after all I said, she simply dumps me without a reason after 3 years together? I'm really so stupid to care about why she is doing this or why se won't talk to me? I still thinks she still feels something for me, otherwise, she wouldn't ignore me like this, I remember when she once said that she'd rather end things with me than make me miserable...

Advice?\nPOST: My first boyfriend of a year is moving away... not even that far. He's moving approximately 30 miles away, but currently he lives 30 miles out. That's a 30 minute drive, and our parents are typical dad strict. Currently, our dates are (or were, I guess) 2 hours per Saturday per week, and that's iffy because my dad is never concise about if I'll be able to go see him or not. It's always a struggle, it's always last minute, but every weekend I make the half hour drive to go see him, and we meet at the mall and hangout. Now, that time is precious. I don't have a doubt that this is love, it's definitely not teenage lust, either. But here's the problem I'm having with this- he's moving 30 more miles out in the opposite direction of me... that would be an hour drive for the measly time that I do get with him, (2-3 hours) and I've talked to him about that. He says he doesn't want to try to make it work, that it's too far and we should just end it... but I'd really like to try to make it work, especially since I just got my license and I am supposed to be getting a vehicle soon for work. I guess what I'm wondering is, how do I deal with this? Do I just let him go? How do I cope with it when my significant other isn't willing to make it work...?\nTL;DR:"}

He's intelligent, funny, well-read, dry and sarcastic when he wants to be, loves silly things on the internet, loves animals, he's also an Aquarius.... He is also very very good looking (objectively speaking). The only problem is - he's of the \"next\" generation i.e. nine years younger.\n\nI don't even know in what way I like him. We get along so well, he says the age gap between us doesn't bother him. He was calling me Ms. ___ (we know each other from a very formal setting) and then started using my first name, and it came so naturally. I have this weird vibe of protectiveness towards him but also wishing he felt more, and then feeling silly that I imagine that I like him.  I mean he's way younger than I am and I am always having a crush on someone or the other and maybe this is my latest target.\n\nThe legal age in my country is even older than 20, so yes, he may be a voting adult at this point but it'll be a while before he is a consenting one. Anyway why am I even thinking like that, he's just a kid! I don't even know. I just needed to ramble. But he's the best thing in my life right now, and I wish there was a way for him to know that. I wish he knew I care more about him than I do about most people. And I wish I knew to what level he cared - or if he did at all.\nTL;DR:"}

A couple years back, current gf asked who former friend was, and for some insane reason I told her she was my ex (not going into that now). \n\nFormer friend/fake ex is now studying for a semester in the small university city I live in on the other side of the world, go figure. They have actually met but the topic of relationships didn't come up. A few other people know that she is supposedly my ex.\n\nNow it turns out she will be at the same party as the gf and I in a couple days and I am worried the whole thing will blow up in my face (current gf has issues with me lying about things and would get very jealous indeed if she knew.)\n\nIs there anything I can do to avoid word getting out or will I just have to face up to my lie?\nTL;DR:"}

She ended up going to a different college our junior year which is only about 45 minutes away.\n\nThe first day she moved in things were weird and with in a week she said she needed a break to figure out what she wants. At first I thought that this was just a weak excuse for a full break up but things have changed now.\n\nI didn't see or talk to her for a month but this past weekend she asked for a ride home. I took her home and we ended up going and seeing her little brothers football game together with her family.\n\nAt first it was fine, just like catching up with an old friend. Then we fell back into the relationship. We spent most of this weekend hanging out holding hands and acting like nothing changed.\n\nShe tells me that she still loves me. She says that she just needs time to figure out who she is as an individual. I do honestly believe her when she says that she doesn't want to hurt me, and that she misses me but I don't know what to do.\n\nDuring that month I was doing really well. I wasn't thinking about her as much and when I did it was all fond thoughts. There was no anger or sadness but when I saw her it all hit me and made me realize how much I lost.

What are things we should look out for when selecting a body shop?\nPOST: Just some background..\nThe first time I put my car in the shop, it was in Tampa, FL. To make a very long story short (I can elaborate if necessary), they backed my car into a fence and destroyed the rear end. Afterwards, it took them over 3 weeks to fix the damage that they caused when they told me it would only take 1. Not only did it take a lot longer than planned but the work was also really shoddy.\n\nThe second time, I decided to get a paint job on the entire car (along with some other modifications, i.e. Clear Bra, PDR, and regular dent repair, etc). I was leaving town for a month so I decided to put the car in the shop when I left. The body shop owner reassured me that the car would be ready when I returned. It has now almost been a week after I was supposed to pick my car up (almost 5 weeks total) and it still isn't ready. The reasoning is that they ordered some parts from the dealership 2 weeks prior and they still haven't arrived. The clear coat and final polish isn't done and the Clear Bra hasn't been installed yet.

He says he can see himself spending the rest of his life with me; that that is what he wants. He has been very sweet, too. But now, the lack of \"I love you\"s is killing me, because I love him and he means so much to me. My feelings and pride are hurt from this, to the point where I'm starting to lose feelings. What a cluster fuck. I feel like I'm trapped in a bad movie.\n\nHas anyone had this happen to them? I don't know what to do. Do I wait and see if he falls in love again? Do I leave him?\nTL;DR:"}

He has several kidney stones and cysts in both kidneys, including a stone that is over 8mm (which is too large to pass). If he doesn't have the surgery to correct this very soon, his kidneys will fail, and he will need a transplant. I found an estimate for each surgery, and the procedure to remove the stones and cysts would be about $30,000, and a transplant would be about $400,000. We would have absolutely no hope of paying $30,000, let alone $400,000, but at the same time, we can't afford to wait for very long.

We have not defined the relationship yet but that talk is probably coming up in like a week or two.\n\nHowever, there is a clear difference in or level of sexual skill. Generally when I start new relationships I am nervous so it takes me ages and considerable effort to come. It's not a big deal to me I usually expect not to climax my first couple times with someone new. I usually try to make up for this by complementing them and being extra vocal. But I could tell she was distressed. Despite my initial problems I know that what she is doing now is not going to cut it later when I am more relaxed.\n\nI also seem to have a very easy time getting her to come. I guess I am lucky that my usual routine is what she needs. But I can tell this is kind of adding to her stress.\n\nMost of the time I am open and direct but I feel that telling her how I work may overwhelm her with intimacy. We started out fast and I don't want that to be more of a problem.\n\nI happen to think I know exactly how she could change what she is doing to make things work for me but I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel inadequate.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: My sister is being targeted by some sort of strange scam, and I can't quite figure out what their game is.\nPOST: Hey reddit,\n\nSo here's the deal. My sister is in college at a small state school in the US. She got a handful of scholarships and through those her school is pretty much paid for. She has received a scholarship that is sponsored by the state and actually given to all qualified graduating high school seniors in my state, but she has never gotten a government grant, nor has she ever applied for a grant or been involved with a grant at all. Yesterday she got a letter in the mail that says something about how the \"HEAA State Grant Funds are being delayed from being disbursed\" and the letter said that she had been refunded $100 dollars. In the letter was a hundred dollar bill. I'm no expert on counterfeits, but it looks like a legit hundred dollar bill to me (it has the little colored strip, it has the phantom face when you hold it to the light, etc.) The letter itself is quite obviously fake. It has a ton of grammatical errors and general non-sense and it's not on official letter head. In fact, it looks like it is a photocopy or scan of a letter. \n\nThe weird thing is, they don't ask her for any further info, they don't ask her to take and deposit the money at a specific bank, or any of the usual scam stuff. It seems like it's just a really poorly written letter with a large bill in it. My sister is off to go talk to her bank, the school, and the post office right now but I'm really curious if anyone has ever seen this before and knows what the game plan here is.\nTL;DR:"}

The disease itself isn't so bad. I've received treatment and haven't had a break out for about 2 years. The worst part is the title; the stigma everyone gives it. I've lost friends. I've lost opportunities with girls who might have otherwise stuck with me. I nearly lose it or have a panic attack every time I tell a girl that I'm about to be intimate with.\nI had my heart shattered last weekend. I was hanging out with a girl that I've had a crush on since high school. She didn't know that yet, but anyway.....we were talking and she told me that she's had a crush on me since high school! I was beside myself. This is the girl that I could see myself spending the rest of my life with. We spent all weekend together. We didn't have sex, so I didn't tell her about my condition. After the weekend, however, she told me she thought we should just remain friends. Crushed. So crushed. I guess I should have maybe seen this coming because here's the kicker: I dated her sister last summer, but the thing is, we only dated for maybe 3 weeks. It wasn't a good relationship and we never even considered being in love. It was purely physical. \nSo I'm thinking that either this girl REALLY STRONGLY feels that she would be disrespecting her sister if we dated, or she talked to her sister about us dating, basically asking her permission, and her sis being the cruel-hearted person that she is, told her I was some kind of horrible monster with some horrible disease. This hurts so bad and ever since the girl said she just wants to be friends, I've been losing sleep, I haven't been eating like normal, I've been losing interest in many different aspects of my life, and I have a sickeningly real feeling that I will actually be forever alone. I'm running out of ideas here.\nTL;DR:"}

Still not great, since both are very hyper pit mixes, but w/e. \n\nAnyway~\nDuring all the times I've seen Tiger out and about (even when she's home she keeps them usually in her bedroom with her), if he goes to drink some water after about literally 4-5 seconds she says \"TIGER STOP THATS ENOUGH WATER\"\nIn a very serious manner, not joking, sometimes she even moves the bowl. \nThis seems really really weird to me, but, she's not the kind of person I could just be like \"hey what's up with that?\"\n\nNo, she doesn't ask Archie to stop drinking, or Beau (the other dog). Tiger doesn't seem to drink excessively at all. Anyone know why she does this? Or if it's kind of a bad thing?\nTL;DR:"}

I took it to the dealership and of course it was covered under the warranty, so no charge.. The problem is that when I picked it up, it had been driven 83 miles. It was in their possession over the entire weekend because they had to order a part. When I confronted them about the miles, they were surprised and offered me 3 months of satellite radio to make it up for it.... Um No. I told them I wanted the extended warranty added onto my truck at no charge, and after a few phone calls up the management chain, I was granted my request. Now, here is where I need your help. They asked that I come to the dealership this week to sit down and make sure the terms are agreeable for both them and myself. Is there anything I need to be mindful of or any advice that you have??

Best friends, family, girlfriends, etc.  If the dishes aren't done the way I want them to be done, it annoys me.  If a person is late 5 min, it annoys me.

No plans were solidified, and she waits until 30 min before dinner to call people, and of course, dinner didn't happen.  I found our friend eating easy mac on his birthday, and it just plainly aggravated me.  Why wouldn't she solidify plans at least a few days in advance?  Why would she wait 30 min before dinner to call people?\n\nYes, I freely admit that I am RIDICULOUSLY egotistical and in general, very cocky.  I know this, I'm working on it, somewhat.\nTL;DR:"}

I have always wanted sleep with one, even date one if I could.  However, I never had any luck finding one interested in me.  I have tried every where, bars, gym, coffee shops, etc.  I have even looked online, (okcupid, craigslist, gocougar).  Never had a ounce of interest.  \n\nI figured it was because of my looks. I am not in the greatest of shapes.  I am not obese, but I don't have wash board abs either.  Plus most women want white or black, not Korean.  \n\nI decided to try an experiment.  Using what I would usually say on a craigslist post, I responded to a post of a older woman looking for a younger guy.  However, I used a picture of a white guy rather than my normal self.  \n\nThe next day after work I received several emails from the woman stating how she liked my reponse the best.  She enjoyed the fact I spoke like a gentleman and she thought I was handsome.   She wanted to meet me for some coffee and would like to get to know me better.  \n\nI tricked a woman into thinking I am someone else.  But I don't know what hurts more, I deceived her or the fact that physically, I am nothing that is desirable to these women.  Maybe it hurts because I can have a phone conversation with this person and possibly hit it off.  But I cannot see her because I am not the type of person she physically desires.\nTL;DR:"}

The lady on the phone sounded utterly uninterested, and when I finished, she merely asked \"So...you want to file a complaint?\" Yes. Yes I do. She then told me that the city's Fire Inspector would be coming out the next day to look at the property, which was good enough in my book.\n\nFriday. I'm at work, just about finished up at roughly 9am when I get a phone call from a local number. I answer, and it's the inspector saying he'd be there around 10:30am. Perfect. I grab some breakfast from taco bell after work and head home to meet him. His first comment when he walked in the house, even though it was absolutely freezing and gusting wind outside, was \"Man, it's pretty cold in here\", to which I agreed. \n\nWe walked through the house, he cited relevant codes and took pictures as we went, and concluded the meeting by getting my Slumlords phone number and said he would be issuing orders to get it fixed immediately, which, because it was Friday, meant it would be Tuesday at the latest.\n\n...\n\nToday: I get a call from the same HVAC company that did the inspection last June, saying they would be over tomorrow to bring 4-6 space heaters and measure up the radiators for replacement, which would happen on November 2nd. I'm still not sure that it's legal to simply supplement space heaters when the city code specifies that the heating system in the house needs to be capable of heating the unit to 68 degrees 5 feet above the ground, but hey, at least it's something. The Fire inspectors will be coming back out to re-inspect the unit sometime in the near future, and hopefully my landlord will get his act together.\n\nThanks /r/legaladvice !!\nTL;DR:"}

Don't judge me, I know it wasn't right and when I woke up the next morning I intended to try to fix it. I woke up early and walked my injured self to the local market and purchased items for a wonderful breakfast omelet.  Eggs, sausage, cheese, red onion and jalape\u00f1o and her favorite orange juice. I was gonna make her the best breakfast in bed. When I arrived home I got to work. Chopped up the veggies, cracked some eggs, browned some sausage and brewed some coffee. I threw everything into the pan (except the coffee) and washed up very well and a few minutes later we enjoyed a delicious omelet and some bagels. After breakfast we were both awake and a little giddy. One thing led to another and eventually we ended up naked which led to some fun for each of us. After a few minutes my girlfriend asked me if I had in fact washed my hands after cooking because she was \"having a burning as if she had gotten jalape\u00f1o in her eye only not in her eye.\"\nTL;DR:"}

We met sophomore year in college, and although lived two hours away we constantly visited each other. A few days ago she tells me she \"doesnt feel the same anymore\" and my chest just about imploded. I can't help but think of all the memories, all the time, all the great moments we shared, to just end. I am having a very hard time coping at the moment and dont know what to do. I want her back, but she wants space. I have to accept that and not cave in to the 10000 thoughts in my head to talk to her. \n\nThis was my longest relationship, my strongest, and I honestly thought she could be the one. I have recently started a post grad shitty job, and all I do is sit in my cubicle in sadness thinking about her. I think about every memory we shared, the nights we spent playing video games and the nights we went to baseball games. \n\nI dont know what to do with myself right now.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [26M] don't get in any relationships - is something wrong with me?\nPOST: I'm a young professional. I go on dates a few times a year, usually concentrated around the times when I'm feeling like going out. Usually these dates don't work out, sometimes they do but I still don't pursue them for more than say 2 months. I never call any of these girls my girlfriends, or consider these to be relationships. This has been going on for about 5 years now.\n\nRecently I met a really nice girl, we never \"dated\" but hung out as friends a lot. She met someone else but came to me to ask if I wanted to date her, and I said no, because I didn't feel 100% sure about her. She went on to date this guy for a few months (which hurt me a bit, unexpectedly), and now they've broken up?\n\nSo my question is, should I be dating people even if I feel like we'd just break up in a few months? It seems like that's what everyone around me is doing. Sometimes I also feel like I can do better or would be settling, so I don't get in relationships. I do feel like I'm ready to settle down, but I'd rather find the right girl than waste several months on someone I'm not feeling 100% sure about. Is this a bad way to go about things? Should I get in more \"throwaway\" relationships?\nTL;DR:"}

Besides the 3 of us newcomers, there were 4 people already living in the house.  Since the move we have all become really close and I could not have asked for a better living situation!\n\nBut, since the end of July I have started to really crush on my one roommate [24 F].  For the past 5 months we have been spending a lot of time together, talking, seeing movies, live music, dancing, and flirting (I think its flirting but what do I know I'm just a dumb guy?).  She is a spontaneous sort of person, think Zooey Deschanel in every single one of her movies, so its hard for me to tell if she feels special feelings for me or if I am just another one of her guy friends.  I would consider these hangouts as \"Dates\" if it wasn't her, and if she wasn't my roommate.  Its tricky.\n\nEvery time we drink together there is usually some sort of physical contact, and when it happens I get the tinglies all up and down my spine.  Its really an amazing feeling, and I want more of it.  I love hanging out with her already but I really think we would be a great couple and I think that is the kind of relationship I would prefer at this point in my life.  \n\nAs I said before, I live with my best friend and his girlfriend so there is double date potential.  The tricky part is not disturbing the house dynamic, and making sure that we both can have some alone time whenever we need it, but we are both sane people so I think we can work these issues out.\n\nMy big question is, how do I initiate things without coming on too strong and making her feel uncomfortable in her own house?  I'm torn between talking it out with her first vs. making a move, then discussing after.  I know the dangers of dating a roommate and have come to terms with the pros and cons of the situation, but the issue I now have is how I should initiate it all.\nTL;DR:"}

This morning we went on a coffee date and bumped into a friend who used to live in the same building as us (we moved out about a week ago but the lease isn't up until the 1st of july). He doesn't know we moved out and mentioned he saw another friend of ours heading to our place at 5PM, I mentioned that we had moved out already and said maybe he was mistaken but he insisted  that they rode the elevator together and the he pushed the button for our floor. My girlfriend has exams next week and I've been working six nights a week. she's been out late studying with a group of mutual friends (including the one who was headed to our old place) often past 10. On the night in question she told me she went to our old apartment alone and studied because our new roommates were being loud, she was home at 10:15. The roommates were not home when I got home at 9. When this came up in the coffee shop she said it was wierd and she never heard him nock or anything. She acted like she was caught in a lie. I really hope she's not lying but I'm not sure what to do. Should I confront her? Snoop? I'm super tempted to search her phone but that seams like it might be an over reaction. Am I crazy?\nTL;DR:"}

The other is a kind of douche who I hated for the first few months. But it was kind of prejudiced and now I see we have a bit in common.

We ended up sitting outside a building and I was hanging my head, upset and such. His friend leaned in to kiss me but in my dream I stopped myself and said \"No, I can't do that.\" But I swear I got the biggest jolt from it. Like butterflies personified. I woke up an hour early and took a long shower. And ever since, I feel like I'm a terrible person and I always look forward to seeing him now. But at the same time, I really love my boyfriend. I love being with him and everything we talk about and every kiss, I swear I cherish. I just want to make out with this other guy and I need help finding a way to get the feeling to go away. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips or ideas or anything? \nI considered telling him because we have an honest relationship like that but I don't want to hurt their friendship or anything. My boyfriend is kind of possessive and will be really hurt by this dream I couldn't control and now my feelings.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm not looking for you to say \"just tell her what you've been doing,\" no, I want to know what makes a person curious to listen. I want to satisfy her curiosity; if she's not curious, there won't be satisfaction in learning about my day. That's why she doesn't ask: she's not curious.\n\nSecond: I'm not an astounding story-teller by any means. There are two factors playing here: first, my mom (I live at home) generally hears my stories first. In those instances, when I do retell a story to my girlfriend, it is a bit watered down, because the excitement of telling it the first time has been extinguished. The second factor is related to the first problem: because my girlfriend doesn't sound really interested, invested in my stories, I don't feel satisfied telling her. So they end up being null. I feel better about talking to my mom, she is a better listener.\n\nI am a good listener. My girlfriend is happy about this, she always looks forward to talking to me. Although she hasn't said it, I know I'm valuable to her for that reason alone.

Pretty much a normal thing to happen.  Well the rest of the day went on pretty normal, helping customers, building random toys, and other objects, a couple hours later i felt I felt a rumble in my stomach, and i didnt think much of it on a count of it was mexican food so whatever i brushed it off.  As the minutes passed the rumles got worse and worse.  I thought to myself i gotta go.  so i ran to the bathroom and did my hour long painful business.  Now at my work we each have radios and an ear piece to talk to one another on the sales floor, I always keep mine clipped on my back pocket and when I ran into the bathroom I forgot about it so when I threw my pants of it got pinned between my legs and the bottom of the toilet, pinned on the speak button.  All my moans and groans, swearing and loud random noises all over the radio so everyone could hear, only cutting off when someone else was trying to talk.  Finally It shut off after some good kicking motions, and I heard in my earpiece people joking finally and asking if I felt better.  I was so embarrassed, and didn't want to leave the toilet for that and because I still had the runs.  Apparently my friends slipped me some laxatives in the mexican food to play a joke on me for ditching them and hanging out with my girlfriend.  Almost three times a day its brought up and made aware of what happened, and I don't see it ending anytime soon.\n**bold\nTL;DR:"}

While growing up, the trust I had in them was always drastically shifting from trust to none in a matter of beatings. \n\nI never had many friends because it was always hard for me to trust people.. I've only had one friend (my best friend for over 7 years) who screwed me over and we aren't friends anymore.\n\nI don't trust anything or anyone anymore. I'm trying to gain trust for my boyfriend. I love him dearly and he's the only one that I love. He'snkind and loving and accepts me for who I am. He lives in another state. Sometimes I feel like he might be cheating on me when he says he's hanging out with his family. Which he tells me is ridiculous. He also says that he loves me more than anything and that he wants to be with me forever.. I believe him whenever he says it, I really do. I just get insecurities that cause me to think otherwise.\n\nI end up getting upset over things that are fictitious. I make up scenarios in my head of him talking up some other girl or texting a girl when we are face timing. When in reality, he's doing neither. I know that I have to stop because I love him so much and losing him would be hell. I would be a brick wall then. \n\nI need to work on my insecurities, I know.. but I don't know how. I live in a broken household and it's tearing me up. I literally sit at home each day. I don't interact with people and at times I feel like I'm going insane. This is all besides the point of course, but it might be closely related to why I don't trust people.\n\nHow do you guys trust? How should I work on my insecurities? Thanks guys!!!\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/jobs\nTITLE: Whats a reasonable amount to expect in a raise for a major promotion?\nPOST: My wife's coworker recently left the company and it seems likely that she may take over his role instead of the them hiring a new person.  She'd be more than doubling the number of people working under her in addition to having more responsibilities and just a heavier workload.  All in all, it'd be a pretty big step up for her.  \n\nAnyway, she's been told there would be compensation to go along with the promotion but was given no details and we've been trying to figure out what to expect/negotiate for.  The last promotion she got (about 2 years ago into a middle management position, but wasn't as big of a jump in responsibility and duties as this would be) came with about a 14% raise.  While it'd be ok if she got about the same amount this time, it still seems like she'd be really underpaid.  \n\nA 15% raise would only bring her salary up to the same rate that the guy who just left was making (he got hired at a higher salary because he had 15 years more experience than my wife did).  Even if she got a huge raise, the company would still be saving a lot of money by not hiring a new employee.  Also, she's been getting 3-5% raises every year anyway just for annual performance if that matters at all.\n\nShe's timid about negotiating anything at all and might just take whatever is offered, even if its less than the amount she got last time.  Its a big promotion and is going to be a lot more work for her and I think she should be compensated well for it, but I'm afraid that asking for more than a 15% bump will be too much even the company would still be saving tens of thousands of dollars by giving her significantly more (by not hiring a new person altogether).

Essentially a car was indicating left at a roundabout (only options were straight and left) but carried on straight over. I had moved out, assuming they were turning left. My fault. I accept that.\n\nNow the insurance company said that they would do all their checks (including indemnity) before authorising repairs. Eventually (about 2 weeks later) they authorised the repairs and the car was taken away. That was about 3-4 weeks ago. The day before yesterday, the car was finally returned, yay! Then yesterday, I received a letter from the indemnity department saying that there was an incident that had not been originally declared. This is where I need help and I apologise for the long post.\n\nThe incident relates to my dad (the main driver and registered keeper) from back in December 2009. Someone (we'll call him A) had stopped in front of my dad and shouted at him for apparently blocking A at a junction. He threatened to claim that my dad touched his car. My dad got home and rang his insurance company asking for advice. They told him it was probably just road rage and not to worry about it, though they'll make a note of it just in case.\n\nThis was the incident our insurer is now referring to. It wasn't declared because they had asked for details of any 'accidents, losses or thefts'. We didn't think general road rage fell under any of these catagories, but now the insurer says they will not pay out and are asking for all sorts of random details (i.e. why did we decide to purchase our car back in 2008).\n\nMy questions to you good people are such:\na). Am I going to have to fork out for the damages to both cars involved in this incident?\nb). Can the insurer just change their mind like this after they've already authorised repairs?

Which the teachers (or chaperons or whoever the fuck decides they need to supervise us during prom) did not find funny at all, and I actually ended up getting 3 days of ISS for doing it.\n\nAnyway, after prom, we meet up at my buddy's girlfriends house before we drive up north to have a giant rager at another buddy's lake house.  We show up, and suddenly I feel REALLY thirsty.  Then the next thing I know I'm in an ambulance on my way to the hospital.\nTL;DR:"}

My wife is in another state with her family since we separated, and can't open it for me. I don't leave a spare key outside. (Not in this god damn city.)\n\nI'm faced with a choice here. Do I call a locksmith, delaying the repair of critical equipment for an important customer, or do I put all that time spent with grunts and engineers in the Corps to good use and use dynamic entry techniques?\n\nClearly, I chose the latter. I got myself into position, took one step forward, and like Leonidas with the Persian messenger in 300, my foot connected and everything went into slow motion.The door flew open with such ferocity, the alarm system got confused, and it couldn't register the door opening for almost two god damn seconds.

That question came after I told her I don't like how her ex messages her. One time her ex messaged her saying he had a dream about her and she was trying to get what he had a dream about out of him. We all know where he was going with that. Now though it's been a week and she seems very distant and we barely talked this week. This is very out of the norm. I am going to talk to her tonight about it if it doesn't change. I just wanted yall's input. Should I be worried?\nTL;DR:"}

When I quit, he immediately panicked and threatened that he will bury me in legal fees.

Some black box analyzes the sound files using FMOD Ex, Fourier transforms, etc., to figure out equations for the sinusoids (if this is possible) that drive the music, outputting just the wave characteristics at the time: waveform (square, triangle, sawtooth, sine, etc.), amplitude, period/frequency, and anything else that's necessary and/or findable. Then some interchangeable black box just creates a graphics scene that exposes ways to alter parameters of the scene (like factors in dynamic texture alteration, camera properties, etc.), and some filter that drives the output of the first black box to interpret for the last. Or something like that.\n\nI don't know where to start making graphics scenes like that, or where to start on signal analysis for what I want to do, or any music theory I should know for interpreting any of this in a meaningful way.\n\nI also want to work on this to the extent that it eventually turns into a visualizer API that other people can and would want to use. To that end, could I also ask any legal-minded people here what the best way to go about copyrighting something as open-source is?

How can I get over this?\nPOST: My boyfriend [M,24] and I [F,21] met back around spring of this year and started officially dating in April. He'd only broken up with his girlfriend of one year a couple months before in the winter, and I knew he still talked to her once in a while but I didn't know to what extent.

Even after the breakup she remained good friends with all of them, so whenever he hangs out with them there's a 99% she's there as well. She's a constant in his life, and all of his friends absolutely love her. She's apart of their inner circle, and it's really obvious I haven't been accepted into it yet. \n\nOn top of that she still talks to his family and (in all honesty) she is much more attractive than I am.

The weight slowly piled back on after I blew out my knee training for the fire department. I managed to keep myself at roughly 190 for quite a while, but was transferred to the UK and dealt with an unhealthy diet and far too much booze.

It wasn't upsetting for me until he started sending book passages, which was very normal for us in the relationship, except this time the passages are overtly romantic. The first one he sent literally contained a quote I said to him when we broke up and discussed hidden feeling painfully coming forth. The second one is a tremendously beautiful passage about first love, heartbreak, and nostalgia. (I am not his first love, although he is mine). \n\nThe second hit me like a cinder block to the face. I feel like I did on the first day after the breakup. Everything I felt for him is rushing back into me and it hurts so bad.\n\nMy dilemma: Either these passages are completely unintentional coincidences or he is interested in being romantic again.

If they are intentional, I want to have an adult conversation about how we are both feeling and where we go from here. What do I do? Do I straight up tell him I'm having feelings again and let him explain himself from there or do I draw a hard line and set up boundaries so I can move on with my healing?\nTL;DR:"}

I am the default parent, and the default adult in our relationship. For the first  year of our eldests life I did basically everything. Every nappy, every feeding (EBF), every outfit change, everything. Recently he has finally started changing a few nappies here and there and helping in small ways but its not heaps, and he often seems to resent doing it. \n\nHe gets grumpy very easily while solo parenting, and while he has never taken it out on anyone physically, it doesn't leave him a very nice person to be around while he's in a mood.

I am only just feeling comfortable with the idea of my eldest having overnights away from me now,  and worry about how soon they would press for him to be able to take belly bub, who I also plan to EBF.\n\nI also don't want to kick him out, because the only place he has to easily go is unsuitable for children and is very far from his work.

I am 29 and he is 28. The first month of our relationship was blissful. He was thoughtful, attentive, and very sweet. Something changed in him and he became a very different person. I think this shift may have partially been from him starting an MBA program and being under stress. He became hyper critical of everything I did. I used to help him clean his house so he could have more time to study but he'd critic me the entire time: from which dish towel I used to if I left crumbs in the sink. He also started to mock me. He'd diminish my accomplishments and tell me to be quiet if I talked about a subject I was interested in that didn't involve him.

I have had congestion problems for the last 2 years or so and was finally able to see a specialist.  Until now, I was taking Nasonex which helped to stop the congestion and runny nose, but did not completely restore my sense of smell.

I managed to grab some shoes and my laptop whilst being rushed by the lil guy, and am now situated in my living room after putting up a sign on my bedroom warning my roommates not to open the door. \nMaintenance won't be available til much later (its about 2 am now), I have work in about 6 hours, and I would love to capture and contain this visitor, but I don't know how to do so without getting stung. How would I do this?\nPart two: My roommates and I don't really love sharing our home with wasps. (I work with insects, so I don't mind nearly as much as they do I'm sure). We actually had a wasp **JUST LAST FRIDAY** that had to be removed. This is kind of the last straw. Before the wasps, we had a fairly bad fly problem and it's still pretty bad. Before, when weather was warmer, we encountered around 8 dead fly corpses daily around the house and live ones constantly buzzing around any light source. Now we're down to maybe half the number of bodies....\nAny hints on getting rid of the flys? Maintenance flat out told us they wouldn't do anything about them because \"the entire building has this problem and there aren't as many when the weather cools off\"\nTL;DR:"}

He is a great boyfriend all round and we don't really argue that much but just lately things have been coming between us. (We live together btw)\n\nA couple of examples:\n 1. I am not intertwined into his friendship group yet, despite me asking to be eased into it, the only events I get invited to are huge ones with everyone around (these people all know eachother very well) and I know I'd be standing there alone next to him feeling isolated. (Have spoken about this.. doesn't help) *long term problem we've argued about before*\n\n2. I am in university and he is working full time. I know he doesn't want to wait years before we can afford a house. *short term problem thats just arisen*\n\nThing is, and this is my main issue, he has ignored me for almost 4 days because I snapped at him the other day. It's an emotional punishment and I don't feel like I can carry on in the relationship if it continues. He has done this a few times before but never for this long at all. Everytime I try to talk to him about it he just starts a fight :(\nTL;DR:"}

Within months of dating, I was spending almost every night at his apartment. Nine months ago we got an apartment together. Now, a new school schedule is forcing me to quit my job, and he will be paying for our apartment in full.\n\nOur time living together has had a lot of ups and downs. At times I am very happy, and at other times I feel totally trapped. He has some perpetual problems that I have learned to live with. But there are others that I am absolutely not willing to put up with. My bf goes through phases of being extremely mean and controlling. He gives me orders, cannot communicate effectively, cannot be flexible, expects me to have no thoughts or feelings of my own about something, and pretty much wants me to live according to him and his rules. This is a level of disrespect that I am not okay with, especially when he will have even more power over our living situation. \n\nEach time this happens I let him know that if things to do not change we will not be living together again next year. They were improving, but it happened again this week. This week we were also looking for new apartments. \n\nI'm finally at a point where I can admit I can't do it anymore. I can't sign a new lease. I can't commit to another year of it. I still want to be with him, but living together is too much for me to do. I have spoken with my family and decided to move home. They support me and will help me financially. I'll be moving out in a few weeks before summer school starts.\n\nNow, I have no idea how to tell my boyfriend. I'm moving out for the summer, taking all my things, all our things that I got. I will think about moving back together in the fall, or I may move with friends. I will still want to spend some nights together, and see how our relationship progresses. I don't think he is going to take this well.. Help?!\nTL;DR:"}

We also exchanged numbers, and I was told he is single. He also made a mentioned as to he never has anyone to go with him to do things, so he normally ends up going alone. He has made mention that he would love to go and do things with me. \n\nI was excited to spend more time with him. Yesterday, I wanted to see if he had Facebook because I took pictures the last time we went out and I wanted to add him as a \"friend\". I found him on Facebook, but I saw that he had \"in a relationship\" as his status. My heart immediately sank. I scrolled down his timeline, and he posted this back in May. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'll see him again tomorrow with friends.

They do not get out much, with my grandfather being 80 and my grandmother being 70 with COPD, Dementia, and Schizophrenia. They both smoke (after stopping once and starting again *ahem* my grandfather) and my grandmother doesn't take her medicine 3/4 of the time. My grandfather has had two wrecks this year alone and almost broke his hip falling down the stairs a couple months ago. For 5 years now, we have been attempting to get them to leave their house and join us (so my mother, a hospice nurse, can take care of them) but my grandfather will not allow it. He constantly makes excuses and says my grandmother hates moving, which is partially true. This Thanksgiving we broke down and had an intervention, telling my grandfather that they would either join us in Georgia by Christmas or we would take protective care of my grandmother. He says he will oblige us but it's not the first time I've heard this... does anyone else have to deal with this type of situation?\n\nHere are some pictures of the house they live in: \nThese do not nearly capture the dilapidated shack it has become.\nTL;DR:"}

When I noticed, I  treated her with Advantage, vacuumed the sh*t out of everything in the house, put down diatomaceous earth (safely!), baking soda, etc etc.  Basically doing everything I can to control it.  I told Housemate that if my cat had fleas, his dog probably did too, but he swore she didn't.\n\nPoint is, it has been months, it is winter, and I think that a) Dog obviously has fleas and b) they are living in the carpet or plush things and coming out and feeding on her.  They couldn't survive off my cat because she had taken Advantage.   He refuses to take Dog to the vet and when I tried to take her (we have the same vet and they know me), they wouldn't let me even get her checked for fleas because I need to be on the list of 'owners' for her to get her an appointment.\nTL;DR:"}

How do we call her out on it?\nPOST: So my friends and I, all being newbs to the age 21, love to go to happy hours and we frequent one restaurant in particular because they have good prices and are open later than many places in the conservative town we live in. We took my friend there to celebrate his birthday and when we got the bill some people put down cash+tip while my bf paid for us the exact amount we owed on his card minus the tip obviously. We had counted it up beforehand but the waitress came back with the receipts for the credit card and informed us that the cash and the charge on the card only just covered the bill and there was no tip. Now we were mostly all at least tipsy by this point so my boyfriend tipped on the table's bill instead of just ours so we made sure the waitress was tipped well. Fast forward to last night: my bf and I and 6 of our friends went to this restaurant again. Because my bf was getting up early this morning for work, we decided to leave before everyone else but calculated our tab plus tip and left more than enough just in case we missed it by a couple bucks. I received a text this morning from my friend saying we shorted them. I spoke to another friend about it and she informed me that the waitress had been a little shady about it (giving two bills to the table, and then again coming back and saying the table was short). I know that we gave her enough and somebody at the table counted the cash before they handed it over. My friends and I are all servers so we know how to handle splitting and paying a large bill at very little work for the waitress. So after that long background, how do we call her out on it the next time we go in? I know reddit is very good at creative things and I am also very bad at confrontation but I think it is very serious she is ripping customers off like this to get a better tip.

I filled the pot with the recommended water and soap, and set it on the stove to boil. At that moment an urge to use the bathroom struck me. At the end of a rather lengthy bowel movement, I had completely forgotten about my pot of boiling water on the stove. So I spend the next hour browsing reddit.\n\nSuddenly my roommate is pounding on my door. I open my door to find our living room filled with smoke. Luckily he had gone into the kitchen to make dinner, and turned off the stove before a real catastrophe happened. Unfortunately for me though, the pot had been on the stove long enough to boil off all the water, and the remains of the stew had been charred to a crisp inside the pot, while t he enamel cracked. I may have also accidentally melted part of the burner, the jury is still out on that one. \n\nSo now our apartment is slowly aerating while we try to get the smoke and smell of burnt food out of our apartment, while my once favorite pot now is cooling on the counter until it can be safely thrown in the garbage.\nTL;DR:"}

I love him (even though he's being an ass) and of course do not want to break up and not have him in my life but this business stuff is horrible.

This week, I went with my parents and younger brother this time because I had a dentist appointment. Now, the dentist I used to have got in a little bit of trouble with the law (she's the one who took out all 4 of my wisdom teeth without anesthetics, see my post history) and \"retired\" back to China, we have a new dentist operating in the same facility now. Anyways, we drove there without incident and I started to get the general clean. It wasn't the actual doctor, but some assistant. She seemed new (intern, maybe?) and she was scraping my teeth with the slow precision of someone dismantling a bomb. She was leaning *so close* to my mouth, like, her nose was almost touching my front teeth (significant because Chinese noses). While she was scraping away, I just had a random thought... \"I wonder what would happen if I just headbutted her right now\". The look of unbroken concentration, the little wrinkle scar on her neck... I mean, she just looked... so headbuttable. \n  \nI didn't end up headbutting her, but the more I thought about it, the more amused I became. I started by smiling, then giggling, then by little laughs that sounded more like \"meeeeeeep\" because the assistant still had her hands (and nose) in my mouth. Soon, I was stifling violent spasms of laughter and the dentist chair was shaking because I was failing. The doctor herself came in to see what was wrong, and at that exact moment, I could no longer hold in my mirth. I started wailing with laughter, and everyone in the office and waiting room could hear it. They ended up cutting the appointment short because I couldn't compose myself enough to let them finish. I ended up laughing for around 10 minutes, and that was more than enough for everyone in the stiff Chinese dentist office to think I was crazy. They told my mom (who was waiting outside) that I was \"a very interesting daughter\"... I have to go back in two weeks to fill a cavity. Cringing in a corner now.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: I'm not sure what to do anymore.\nPOST: Hi there, I have class soon so I will try to be quick.\n\nI'm an 18 year old freshman away at school. I graduated high school as valedictorian, highly motivated in school and learning. However for some reason, I never really had a love for any school or a burning desire to go to college. However since I was highly regarded, very smart, and did extremely well on standardized tests, people just assumed I would be going to college. Personally I had no desire either way, but since everyone around me figured I would, it seemed like the right thing to do. Even to me now, it seems like the \"right\" thing to do.\n\nFast forward to now, and I absolutely hate it here. Everyone says that I'm homesick, but I don't think thats the whole story. I don't feel happy here, but it's also not that I miss my hometown. Most of my friends are gone at school anyway, and I know that being at home wouldn't be the same as before.\n\nAnyway, I've been thinking and I finally have an idea of what to do. I want to drop out of school here, enroll in a college back in my town, get a job (I love working), and explore doing things that I enjoy. I have many novels that are half finished that I would love to focus on.\n\nAnother thing to add is that before I left for school I was in therapy. I have depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. My psychologist believed that going to school would help me since it would let my mind \"grow\" and be free, but I don't know if that's true.\n\nIn the end, as you can tell by this, I'm kind of a mess. I don't know what to do. My classes here aren't overwhelming and I can thrive here academically if I want to, but I don't think I want to. I also don't want to be a failure and a drop out, or leave and regret it later on. \n\nCan anybody with experience in this please add any insight or advice. Thank you so much. :)\nTL;DR:"}

I don't want her to die young or get diseases! She is not healthy!\" It was humiliating. Today I hardly ate at work, because he embarrassed me so much on Monday and he commented on the fact that I wasn't eating. I told him to leave it alone but he kept saying \"no, what have you eaten today?!\"\n\nEvery time Phil comments on my food and drink choice, I say I don't care or just roll my eyes. Lately I say stop. But he doesn't stop. It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to eat or drink in front of Phil. \n\nWhat can I do to make him stop? Am I overreacting like crazy?\nTL;DR:"}

Let's see how you like this.\nPOST: Background: At my university, the dorm rooms are split into two bedrooms, each housing two people, sharing a half-kitchen area. We need a keycard to get into the room proper and then a normal key to open our respective bedrooms. \n\nWe had some snow-induced closings a while back, so I didn't have much to do and I was playing video games with my suitemate (guy who lives in my dorm room, but in the other bedroom). The door was open, we were talking at a plainly audible volume, so anyone in either bedroom would know I was there. My roommate, a spectacular asshole, decides to go home for the weekend, which would be excellent, except that he locked the door as he left, leaving my keys inside the room. As a result, I had to pay a lock-out fee and get an RA from the front desk to let me into my own bedroom. \n\nAs part of my petty revenge, I moved my TV from a neutral position in the room to the extreme edge of my side of the room. I've also been using his tissues and lotion when he's out of the room. \n\nVengeance is sweet.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (28/F) am having communication difficulties with my fiance (28/M) on social and ethical issues. How can this gap be bridged?\nPOST: We've been together for 19 months. There are enough external stresses on our relationship (AKA family drama and career uncertainties) and I find it easier to play along or agree with him rather than have a fight. This may develop into an unhealthy conflict avoidance pattern, so how can it be nipped in the bud?\n\nSome background: The issues on which I disagree but pretend to agree are relatively minor. Things like not wanting to meet certain people, but going with him because he wants me to go. I never try to stop him from going himself nor do I passive-aggressively discourage him from going. On the ethical front, the gap is bigger. I've made lifestyle changes that meet his vegan tendencies, but I don't feel strongly either way about using leather, eating organic vegetarian, etc. Is it normal to let your partner believe you are in complete agreement over minor issues like these? For example, disagreeing with his reasons for not using silk doesn't mean I want to start using silk. The way I see it, disagreement with lead to a fight but no change in lifestyle, so why bother fighting?\n\nAnother reason for avoiding conflict is that he doesn't accept compromises from me. I choose to compromise on the small things because it is nothing compared to our compatibility on more important issues. He sees it as \"not the right way to get along.\" If it weren't for this, I would not be hiding.\n\nAny advice on how to stop hiding and fix communication?\nTL;DR:"}

It's been a month since he's left but to summarise, I've found out he's lied about a lot - even throughout our relationship. The most ironic of all of these was he lied about having a Facebook, he had me blocked on it the entire time (we were together for almost 2 years, would've been in October) and it was active, no display of me really - it had  a lot of history on it though. \n\nMy point is, I always begged and asked him to be honest and now I've found out so many things that just make it all seem like a lie. does it mean that what we shared wasn't real or authentic? I mean the biggest lie of all was that he said he's sorry he lied about being in love with me but he wasn't \"anymore\".\n\nI guess I just needed a place to rant, or advice to move on. I'm sorry I'm a mess. The relationship was beautiful to me up until the end, up until being completely blind-sided. It just feels now it was all a lie and I was used for a place to live.

Hopefully you can shine some sunlight onto my day. I work in Ontario, Canada and have been at a company for 10 years, with a little break. The company has a habit of doing \"temporary layoffs\" in which employees are essentially put on furlough with no severance until a time period expires. \n\nAs someone who brings in a lot of money for them, I suggested that I would stay on as an employee if they added an IF, THEN (I'm a nerd) clause in my contract. Essentially, IF you create any kind of severance in my employment, including temp layoff, THEN you will trigger this clause which pays me my allocated severance (1/week per year of employment). They said NO! That's not legal, it will trigger the same thing for every employee! I think this is hogwash, but I quit because of it. I'm curious if it's a bunch of bullshit or if they were being honest... Go lawyers! Thanks for any input!\nTL;DR:"}

I moved here not too long ago after my fianc\u00e9 broke off our engagement and I don't really know anyone in the area or have any friends close by.\n\nWe were friendly and would say hi and chat when we were both there at the same time.  Nothing too deep just friendly.  Maybe a little over a month ago she was very drunk when I saw her one night.  She came on real strong, which works on me, and we started hanging out and then sleeping together on a semi regular basis.\n\nTurns out she has been through some serious shit.  Abuse--and not like being treated bad-- like broken bones.  She lost a child at one point (unrelated to the physical abuse).  And I suspect she might have had a problem with opiates at some point.  She drinks more than I realized (and more than I am really comfortable with) but I get why she is doing it.  Most of the things she has told me about have been when she's drunk and I am not 100% sure she even remembers telling me all of them.\n\nI want to get to know her better but I don't know how to approach her about:\n\nA. Her past\nB. Her drinking\n\nAny thoughts or related stories are welcome.  I'm not really used to being in a situation like this.  I suppose we all have our problems but I can't say I have much experience with anyone who has been through as much shit as this girl.\n\nThe last thing I would want to do is hurt her but I don't know if I really want to continue seeing her if she is going to be as self destructive as she seems to be.  I also don't feel like I have any right to tell her how to live her life after hanging out for a month or so.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Boyfriend [23M] won't commit to relationship with me [20F]\nPOST: We have been together for 10 months, and our relationship is awesome. We don't fight and he is probably the best thing that has every happened to me. Whenever we do get into arguments, we settle it out in a healthy way (this is how I feel, how can I make it better, etc). We get along very well and have a great sex life. About three months ago, things become long distance (~1 hour away) but we still communicate well.\n\nThe only thing is that he seems afraid of commitment. About 6 months in, I said \"I love you', and he said it back but didn't seem to mean it. After about a month I called him out for it because he never said it first and whenever he did say it back, he kind of mumbled it. He finally admitted he wasn't sure- and when I told him that he shouldn't have lied to me and to only tell me when he's ready, he was like 'No! I didn't lie. It's not that I don't, I just don't know.'  By the way he treats me, he definitely does care about me/shows love for me, and I don't want to rush him. But I don't think he will ever say it.\n\nFinally, throughout our entire relationship he doesn't really show public affection toward me. Together, it's perfect, but in front of friends or online it's like we aren't even together. I don't think he's trying to hide me (everyone knows we are in a relationship and we are together on facebook info box or whatever) but at the same time I feel like he doesn't show me off or anything. We've literally taken only one picture together the entire time we've been together while he has taken millions of pictures with his friends.. I can't help but think that the reasons you take pictures is because you care and want to keep a memory with someone, so he must not want to keep any memories with me. Could you guys give me any advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I desperately tried to fix things, but as expected they were in vain, it's too late.  \n  \nMy question is - how can I deal with a breakup that's pretty much a complete sucker punch, completely one-sided and one where the girl is in my eyes completely perfect (again, I thought that even before developing feelings).  \n  \nAnd also, is there a chance for us to ever be together again? If so, what should I do?   \n  \nAny help is very much appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

They are always asking him why we're still together. When yelling or getting mad at me, he makes it seem like \"I'm great to you and you're the worst person on Earth\" (almost exact words at one point). If I try to tell him my problems, he'll call me a baby or tell me why his life is a lot harder and I shouldn't be complaining. He will even get mad at me over things my or his parents do.

There was a very cold, wet sensation over my head (i have a number 2 cut) followed by a dampness covering my ears and my face.

My ex [18f] wants to give us another shot and I'm incredibly torn\nPOST: We started dating at the end of senior year (last summer). We had to do long distance and saw each other once every other month. We ended things twice... Once during winter break and one during spring break. This was mainly because she wasn't the best at communicating and gave up(breaks up) every time we argued.\n\nIt's been 5 months since spring break and since we've seen each other. She contacted me to catch up and this led to us talking about our relationship. She says she has changed and is becoming more open with friends and family. She also says that she made rash decisions and shouldn't have given up on us every time we argued.\n\nI know that I used to have strong feelings for this person and just need to be reminded of what it is like to be with her. The issue is... I'm leaving in 4 days. She said she had a fling with two guys while we were apart (assuming sex). This bothers me because it's making me question how much she has actually changed. She says she wants to take things slow and be less coupley because of her flings. We have 4 fucking days. I told her about this and she says she will try but doesn't want pressure that she has to be a certain way...\n\nI don't know what to do... I need to be reminded of why I loved her but idk if she'll be emotionally avaliable enough. We will be apart for 4 months. I know that she could be the one, and I don't want to regret anything. I need help... Advice. We will see each other again winter break for two weeks. Do we take things slow these next few days and throughout the distance? Should we wait till winter break? Everything is helpful and if you guys have questions or clarification, feel free to ask. Thanks :)\nTL;DR:"}

We hung out a few times over lunches and met for dinner and decided to become exclusive a few months later.  She's about 50 miles away with a few kids so we have to plan our dates well.

Before this we were friends and hung out in the same friend group for about a year before it became obvious I liked him more than friends.\n\n\u00a0\nIt was me who asked him out. He is super introverted and during the time I've known him I have never seen him with a girl neither have any of our mutual friends and he's only ever had one girlfriend that anyone knows of. \n\n\u00a0\nSince that first date we have been hanging out twice a week and every time it's fun and adventurous and awesome. We have kissed but not had sex.\n\n\u00a0\nMy problem is something that shouldn't be a problem for me because I'm a feminist and grew up liberal and it's 2014 and I'm not from the South so WTF brain...\n\n\u00a0\nHe never pays for dates or even tries. All of the guys I have dated at least paid for the first date or if they were broke (we make the same amount of money and both in uni) they would at least make me dinner at some point or pay for coffee. I know it's only been a month but we have gone out to eat together at least 5 times and nothing.\n\n\u00a0\nMaybe relevant info: When it's time to pay for whatever I never leave it hanging and just say \"separate!\" if the waitress asks because I'm like that and don't want him to think I expect it so I'm not really leaving him an opportunity BUT most guys would intervene and insist on paying at least once.\n\n\u00a0\nWhy do I care about this? The dynamic is perfect and there's not doubt in my mind we are on the same wavelength emotionally. \n\n\u00a0\nI can't talk to my friends about this because they are also friends with him and I'm actually ashamed to feel this way.

I haven't told him about my problems growing up or in college, or anything super personal really.

Like for example, if you dealt with past issues, i.e. you used to be a kleptomaniac. Or had an eating disorder. Or you were a semi alcoholic. Or suffered from sexual assault. Say you got over something crazy that really bothered you at one point in your life, and now everything is fine, you got therapy, you got over it. How important is it for a long term bf/gf to know these things about you, if it's super personal and makes you super vulnerable, but it should no longer be an issue in your current relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

It was a fair price for a 2TB so I bought it before somebody beat me to it. My bad experience started to happen as soon as I paid for it because the seller didn't send it for a week. So I messages him no response and finally he sent it and apologized for not responding. So I decide the drive and I am a bit dissatisfied with the appearance because it was dirty and it looked like it used to have stickers all over it. But I could've lived with that especially since it was used. But then I plugged it in. It wasn't 2Tb. Instead it was 1.5Tb. I thought it was partitioned but after reformatting it wasn't. I look up the serial on the LaCke website and guess what. 1.5 Tb. I contacted the seller, he didn't respond once again. I opened a case and then he responds. He states that the drive is 2tb and told me to reformat and that the LaCie site says its 2Tb and that it probably needs reformatting, which I already did, and that he strictly says no refunds. Well this is against eBay rules to sell something misleading. So I explain that I did the reformatting check the site and it is all 1.5Tb. So that is my current bad experience with this asshole.

We broke up mutually about 6 months ago as our careers (which we won't sacrifice) are taking us both to wildly different places and she had also decided that I was more in love with her than she was with me. \n\nIt was amicable, no fighting, we are friendly when we do communicate which isn't often unless something comes up. We have completely different groups of friends, have our own hobbies etc. so don't run into each other. She is definitely moving on, has a bunch of fuck buddies at her work and elsewhere (which doesn't bother me really as I have a few girls I have slept with too). We have given each other space, we have gone no contact for long periods of time.\n\nHowever, I can't seem to move on. She is all I think about, I've hit the gym and lost weight, slept with several girls/have some into me that I also am into. I have hobbies, hang out with my friends weekly, have been doing new things alone and with friends, I have school as well, also a nice place, car, etc. I can't seem to get past her no matter what I try and it's become incredibly painful, lonely, and distracting. I am still just as sad as when we broke up. I've never been like this in a relationship but this girl I thought I would grow old with and I lost my lover and best friend at the same time. I know time is supposed to heal but I'm at 6 months and I still feel just as sad/lonely/missing her as at first. I hate it. What do I do? I want to be done with this pain, I want to move on. I just don't get it, I am doing all these things and yet I'm still not moving on at all, I really want to.\nTL;DR:"}

Over the years, she raised my siblings and I while working random jobs to get by. She always enjoyed american entertainment as well as vietnamese. However, she never got around to learning fluent english, so she struggles with american film and books.\n\nAbout three years ago on a trip to California, she found a vietnamese book store that translated popular books from english to vietnamese. She picked up the first two books in the Harry Potter series as well as the first Twilight book. She fell in love with them. She read them over and over, until she could get her hands on the next books. Eventually, she bought all of the books and read them all, and she still reads them. \n\nThis brings me to my point.\n\nShe has always expressed interest in The Lord Of The Rings, and I believe she is unaware that they were actually books. I would like to try and find these books in Vietnamese for her, so that she can enjoy them as much as I have. \n\nSo my question is, does reddit know where I can purchase The Lord Of The Rings books as well as The Hobbit in Vietnamese?\nTL;DR:"}

I have been troubled by this dilemma, so here's my tale.\n\nMy SO and I got a puppy in the fall. He's a little firecracker, part Husky and part Jack Russell. I've raised a Jack Russell as my family dog so I know the breed and rewards challenges associated with it. He's pretty much housebroken, is almost 6 months old, and does fairly well in his kennel when left alone for several hours.\n\nMy SO and I recently split, and I'm just wondering what were the challenges faced and concessions that had to be made in the name of Dog? Specifically for a single person, but any advice is welcome.\n\nAs for myself, I'm a grad school student entering (hopefully) into my PhD next year at a highly challenging program. I'll be busy with school, but I do study lots from home. I love walking, and take my boy on plenty of long walks and hikes. I also like a weekend getaway to a ski resort, how dog-friendly are accommodations typically in these areas? (I don't mind going covert dog-ops either) \n\nMy concerns are that I won't be able to devote the time he really needs to be happy and he'll severely interfere with my social life/adventurous side. Especially since my aunt, uncle, and cousins would be glad to have him in a rural community, where I could occasionally visit.\nTL;DR:"}

Now because I talked to her one of my friends saw her at a meeting and they got along well. They both hang out a lot and the girl I like now has pretty much joined my friend group. I tried to stick around the group and hang out too but every time I do and I see this girl I think why is she even hanging out with us? We all have known each other for a while and she's a year under us... The only reason is that she clicks well with one girl in my friend group and basically gets invited around everywhere now...\n\nI feel like if I didn't go on that little date in the first place this could have all been avoided and they never would have met... I can't help but feel that she made her way into my friend group without my consent when I'm the first person she has met out of the group... She had a boyfriend and I wanted to cut all ties with her.\n\nAnd that's exactly what I planned to do but look at where I am now. This girl is pretty much set in the center of my friend group and I am the cause of it. I don't want to talk to her, I don't know this girl, she hasn't been around this group from the start, why should she get a special ticket in?\n\nI think the real thing that pisses me off is that it's not fair. She didn't want to date me and I was okay with that so I then made the choice of not wanting to be her friend. But then she some how gets into my group of friends and now I'm put into this position where I should befriend her.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Morally Questionable Animal Neglect Situation\nPOST: Hi there,\n\nSo my husband and I live in a house we moved into a little over a year ago. We have spent a lot of time making renovations and have adopted two dogs of our own-- it really feels like a home. We have been spending a lot of time on our back patio the past few months and have taken notice to out backside neighbor's new puppy. However, before I discuss more about this dog, let me provide a little background info.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, my neighbor had a new puppy that was about 15 pounds. Some nights when it was especially cold outside, we noticed their pup being left outside. In fact, they usually left it outside 100% of the time. That dog disappeared. I don't mean to make any speculation. A number of things could have happened to the puppy, but I do remember the dog being left outside without much care. \n\nThey recently came up with a new puppy, this time a toy-sized dog. It is also left outside quite a bit and is only played with when the kids chase it around the yard. We were recently shocked to see the same kids spit at our own dogs through the chain-link fence the other day. Clearly they have not been taught how to properly interact with animals.\n\nAnyway, their new puppy always whines when we are outside now and has learned to climb over the fence. Some days, we have come home from work to find our two dogs playing with their puppy in our yard. We always keep our dogs inside when we are home, but recently our neighbor's puppy has been climbing over the fence and whining out our back door. My husband and I are animal lovers, and we are feeling conflicted about how to go about resolving this.\n\nMy husband suggested we post here just to see what kind of responses people come up with. Anything goes, from putting the dog back time and again to finding a new home for the dog ourselves. We would just like to get some feedback. Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

She has been out most of the time since then doing volunteer work while I watch our kid at home. I can't get the thoughts of her with someone else out of my head.

She said she just wants her space and doesn't want anyone right now. I am giving her her space now and hoping I can trust that she is taking time alone and not using this to see him behind my back. \n\nI feel hurt. I know she does too.

My major is Philosophy and my minor is Film and Television. I chose these interests because I was/am interested in going into entertainment law. I have a 3.8 cumulative GPA, but I have not taken the LSAT yet (scheduled for Sept. and Dec.). \n\nI work full time, and I have the entire time I have been in school. I am promised a promotion and a raise upon graduation. With the promotion, I will be making $50k/year. \n\nIs it better for me to go (way) into debt for my J.D., with no guarantee of a job upon graduation three years from now, or take the job I'm promised next year and accrue no debt?\n\nIn the long run I see two outcomes-- either I go to law school and come out with gigantic student loans which I will struggle for years to repay, or I can leverage the management role I could take upon graduation as a stepping stone to bigger and better things?\nTL;DR:"}

I try to keep things light and fun which usually results in me never being serious. And for the most part I get along well with people and make lot's of friends. But there's this one guy who kinda is ingrained in my circle friends who I can't stand! I thought after high school I'd never have to deal with him again but now my one and only close friend has been hanging with him alot, and therefore I have to see this massive prick. Everytime I'm around him I try to give him a chance, and everytime he's justbas bad if not worse. He does little things like picks up on one insecurity of mine and harps on it, tries to give me advice on things he assumes I need in an insulting way, he'll call me out on stupid jokes I make and make me feel jusy generally inferior. Last night I was at a party with him which was fine at first until he started the dick waving contest he always does and even began trying to choke me out. I was about to knock him the fuck out. The problem is because what he does is so subtle and directed towards me, nobody else would believe that he's the biggest asshole of a generation. He puts on a nice guy persona for everyone else, and I feel if I did decide to maybe insult him back or punch his stupid face everyone I know would think that it's uncalled for, and I'd be pretty much a pariah psycho to them. So I guess I'm wondering how do I deal with him? Do I put him in his place? Do I continue to ignore him?\nTL;DR:"}

I reached out online, and I met Jon. We instantly clicked, but we were just friends because I was still with Brock, even though I was planning on breaking up with him. I finally broke up with Brock (took me about two weeks because I had to go see him to do it in person), and I immediately went and saw Jon afterwards. I couldn't help it.\nSo we were together, and he kissed me. It was the greatest kiss of my life. After that we were inseparable for both weekends. I would go see him, and we would just talk and laugh. He admitted to me that he could see himself marrying me, and I agreed.We even joked about it being like how grandparents tell their kids and grandkids that they met one night and got married the next day. It was that great. \nIn that moment he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I agreed.I realize there's a \"honeymoon\" phase, but it just felt so right. \n\nThen I come back the next weekend, but I'm there to see friends. I ask him if he wants to see me and he says he doesn't care either way. That hurt, but I'm not the one to freak out over shit. So I just let it go and enjoy my weekend with my friends. Then I get back to my home and I text him Monday and ask what we are. He tells me we aren't working out, but when I move to the place he's at(which I was planning on before I met him), we should try again. What does this mean? I think about those two short weeks so much. I can't even think about talking to other guys because I feel guilty.  \n\nIt's been a month since those two weeks, and it still feels so right to me. I know that isn't a long time, but I just want him in my life.\nTL;DR:"}

For 2 of those years we've lived together. I was fully aware before we got together that Drew came with baggage. He has 4 children ranging between the ages of 4 and 10. He also has a $30,000 debt and black mark to his name.\n\nI really love Drew and we've been through hell and back together, but I think I severely underestimated the weight his baggage would have on me, who is debt and child free. I've never had an issue with his children and we all get along really really well, but I no longer think I have the skills to cope with the money problem. My biggest issue is Drew's reaction towards the debt problem.\n\nSince he has been really stupid with money in the past, this particular straw broke the camels back today. We received a letter in the mail from a power company (not ours) with a bill for $990 in Drew's name. When I asked him about it, he told me when he was renting a property he sub-leased to a work colleague, but left the bills in his name, trusting his work colleague to pay for the utilities. Of course, I was furious. How can a man in his mid-thirties be so goddamn stupid? Drew brushed it off when I voiced my concerns eg. it's getting exhausting playing catch up on your mistakes and I'm really drained. The only thing he said to me was \" well it's done now, I'll make a payment plan and we'll start paying it off.\"\n\nI guess my question to you guys is, how do I deal with this better? Am I too angry over things that can't be changed? Is it wrong for me to expect a little remorse on his part? Why am I feeling so wound up about my boyfriends past mistakes?\nTL;DR:"}

The thing is, he didn't have much of a life where we lived before, it was his hometown so he had friends there, but not much else, his family all moved away from his hometown as well so we thought it would be good to get out of there, try and do a bigger city. I have made an intentional effort to not hang out with my friends from high school too much, I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't just leave him in the dust. Every time he wants to have someone over from work I say yes immediately and encourage him to pursue the friendships he is growing with his coworkers. We just got off the phone (i'm at work, it's his day off) and the conversation turned to his unhappiness, he said of course he's unhappy, he doesn't feel like he has anything going for him. \"So our relationship is the only thing I have to be proud of... so when we have problems to work on or something it feels like I just fail all around.\" is what he said to me. So whenever I bring up that he seems unhappy or any problem at all he takes it really poorly. I just feel so under appreciated right now. I mean I'm avoiding my friends willingly (without saying a word to him about it) to make sure that he doesn't get left alone too much, I do most of the cleaning and since I make more money, I often try and pay for things and am trying really hard to stay positive. \nI am getting so burnt out, I am a worrier, I struggle with anxiety myself, but I just feel so alienated from him right now. I don't know how to handle this anymore. I love him and do believe that he loves me, I just don't know how to deal with him, he seems so illogical and unreasonable...\nTL;DR:"}

I confronted him and he stopped... \n\nOr so I thought. Turns out not long after, he created a Tinder account to meet friends who he set to just females. When I found out I asked him why he doesn't search for male friends on there too (since it was all innocent right) and he said males adding males is weird generally. So I threw a bitch fit because meeting friends on Tinder is pretty innopropriate, especially since its used for dating and those girls are there for a reason, and he deleted it. BUT not before adding a couple of girls to Facebook and giving out his cell number. \n\nI saw his text message to one of them and he wrote something on the lines of \"I'm always happy to open my text messages and see that its you who texted me :)\". Kind of bothered me but I moved past it until he put a lock on his phone today. I can't bring myself to trust him knowing that he's hid flirty messages from me before and has flirted, and now his phone is locked so he can be saying anything. If I ask him why hell say he's entitled to lock it, but is that really the case when you've flirted and hid things from the person you love?\n\n I need opinions, am I being jealous or do I have the right to feel upset and distrustful?

She asked if there was a woman named Diane that teaches the next class. Now mind you, I am absolutely terrible at remembering names, even after spending 3 months of time with them, I just can't manage to retain that information. Also due to the fact that my brain was totally focused on finals, I could not, for the life of me, remember if that was her name. \n\nMe: \"Ummm...No?\" *you fucking idiot*\n\nGirl: \"Oh, okay thanks\"\n\nShe walked away and, after taking several seconds to think over it, I decided to look up my teacher's name.\n\n\"*Alright, there's my psychology teacher, there's the one for algebra, okay and....fuck.

There are two questions in here, the first part being that they hired two people then let one go, and now won't give me a severance I was verbally promised (wish I had it writing), and part two regarding not being paid overtime.\n\n**Part One**\n\nThree months ago I interviewed and was offered a job, they told me they couldn't decide between two of us so they hired both since they thought we were so great! It's a small company owned by a husband and wife, we didn't really interview with the wife, however it turns out she sort of runs the ship. The other person hired clicked with the wife a lot more (she was very bossy, micromanage-y, and overall I didn't enjoy her and I think she knew it). Also possibly relevant, I was the higher paid of the two of us.\n\nThere was honestly not enough work for two people doing the same job, and we would get in trouble if we were helping each other work (as opposed to finding out own stuff to do).\n\nFast forward to the 90 day review time, long story short I was let go. It was a frustrating situation where I was sent a cryptic email that suggested I would be fired in 5 days, and had to go into the office and ask my boss if he was going to fire me on Monday morning at 8am - this being Friday afternoon - and he admitted to it and so I left then as opposed to dragging it out over the weekend. At that time he told me verbally that I would be receiving two weeks of pay as a severance (not legally required, but I guess because he felt bad firing me for no real good reason other than his wife not liking me).\n\nI got my last paycheck, and there was no severance. I have been texting, calling, and emailing for 4 days now and my boss is not responding (the texts show he's read it). This is not surprising given his usual submissive and avoiding personality.

A year into our marriage, she told me she was really into the idea of infidelity, like as a turn on.  She liked the idea of imagining me with another woman. We started simple...we would fake online dating profiles in other cities, and start online relationships with women, together.  These conversations would often lead to sexting, whatever.  She got turned on by being a part of the process, and would write all the emails and messages (with some input from me). \n\nAs time went on, Alyssa decided that she wanted things to go further and I was game. We started doing the same thing locally, and I actually went on a few random dates, no sex. When I got home, she would always want to hear every detail, and it would drive her crazy, and the sex afterward would be amazing.  She was still involved, and she would choose the women and communicate with them, even after a first date.\n\nTwo months ago, Alyssa arranged a date for me with a woman I'll call \"Jody.\" It went really well. Alyssa had told me previously that she wanted to open up our relationship, and had encouraged me to sleep with my dates if I wanted to. I agreed. So, on our third date, Jody and I slept together.\n\nThis is where it gets complicated...I'm developing feelings for Jody. Jody knows about my wife but doesn't know the extent of her involvement (choosing the women, writing texts, planning dates), she just thinks I'm in an open relationship. Jody seems really into me, but a part of me wonders if she has fallen for me or Alyssa. \n\nI haven't told Alyssa about my feelings, and I think she would be crushed. I love my wife, but Jody fulfills me in a way I never knew was missing. She also seems like she's interested in making things more serious. What should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

I figured the dogs got into the bathroom garbage and when I went to pick it up I found a used condom in the middle of it. It was gross but I took a good look at it and it definitely looks used. Crusty and has some dried stuff inside.  For the life of me I can't think of the last time my wife and I used a condom.  I've never really been suspicious of her cheating but this strikes me as very strange.  I work long unpredictable hours as a fire fighter paramedic and it's possible that she could have people over without me knowing.  The only possible  explanation for why a condom might have been used that wouldn't have been her and I, would be that her sister was down here visiting with her nephew for easter.  Maybe she hooked up with someone?  Either way this does not look good but before I confront her I want to have all the details.\n \n\nI have the condom stashed away and I was curious if any of you know any reputable places where I can send a dna sample from her and one from me and get a comparison between what is on the condom?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [22M] don't know how to pick up where I left off with her [21F] after winter break\nPOST: I met a girl in my class before the break, it seemed like she was interested, lots of staring, some teasing, hugs, etc.  The problem is that I really didn't want to push for anything right away because I'm an idiot and felt it might make the class weird if it didn't work out (it was a really small class, like 30 students).  So we went out for dinner a couple times, and made a plan to do something after the break.  But we haven't spoken to each other at all over the break, which has been 3 weeks.  In fact we actually barely spoke at all outside of class.  Also, the dinners we went to weren't really dates.  Hard to explain, but they weren't planned like dates, and after both of them she just kind of left and said, \"Thanks for dinner.\"\n\nI have no idea how to start talking to her again with the intent of dating.  I have never asked someone out over text or phone before, so that terrifies me.  I really prefer asking out in person, it's easier to read expressions.  And I feel like if I ask her to meet up to do something not explicitly as a date, like lunch, she'll think of it as a just friends thing, with good reason.  So I'm hoping I can get some advice on how to get this going again.  To be honest, I think she may already be over it based on how she was talking to me just before the break, but I still want to give it a shot.\nTL;DR:"}

I started to see them occasionally, and I really bonded closely with this one girl. She would always talk to me, and we would spend a lot of time talking to each other outside of our usual gaming time.\n\nShe suffers from severe depression and sleeplessness, and I've been doing everything I can to help her out of it. Now, this is something that typically the boyfriend would handle, but he generally doesn't show emotion much and doesn't seem to care much of the time, so I am usually the one trying to console her through her depression. This only strengthened our relationship with each other, and we came even closer together.\n\nFast forwarding to present day, I noticed that she suddenly started to talk to me a lot less and wouldn't want to do stuff she normally would do with me. When I approached her about it, she stated her boyfriend didn't like the fact she was always on her phone talking to me and wanted her to stop. Her boyfriend, who she has been living with for 2 1/2 years, generally doesn't like me that much, but this shocked me.\n\nWe now rarely talk (to put it into perspective, we used to talk constantly throughout the day and now I get a max of 10 texts from her), and it is devastating me. She insists that she still wants to be friends with me, but it now feels as though she doesn't/can't talk to me or is ignoring me. Is there anything I can do?\nTL;DR:"}

My relationships with people I have a geniune interest in always seem to get really intense, relatively fast compared to how my peers and friends approach their relationships. \n\nI don't mean like meet someone, then latch onto then and imagine them to be my new bff/SO but it seems like I always seem to get to know someone really well in a very short space of time then run out of things to talk about with that person? Like, I'll know all the deep dark secrets and personal hopes and dreams and their life philosophies but have trouble just shooting shit. \n\nMost of my close friends are people who I've bonded over a rough patch in their life (them complaining), in my life (me complaining), a common difficulty (mental health, sexuality, toxic person) and I don't seem to be able to make close friends from more inconspicuous means e.g. just sharing a class. I make ok friends but not the type you'd make an effort to hang out with outside class (Which is fine I know) but if I make an effort to get close to someone the relationship intensity seems to go from 0 to 80 no matter what I try to do to slow it down. \n\nPreviously, this has caused romantic relationships to fizzle out since it seemed like we had nothing else to talk about. \n\nThe only thing that seems to help is to do an engaging activity together e.g. painting or cooking and then we don't have the focus to talk about anything intense.\nTL;DR:"}

A lot of it was long distance, but we managed to see each other every two weeks, and had lots of time together during holidays. This semester shes doing a semester abroad in my city, and we kind of moved together into her parents' place, but I still had my place. Her parents don't live there, but it is nice. Two weeks ago she breaks up with me out of the blue. She doesn't want a relationship right now, she's not in that kind of place.\nWhatever, I've philosophised about that a lot, but I have a more concrete question.\n\nWe planned a new years trip to one of her friends' place. I hosted the last new years party for her friends, and so, of course, I'm invited this year. We bought tickets together. She still owes me the money for her tickets, so we're meeting on friday so I can receive it. She is, as it turns out, adamantly against me going along, although she wants to remain friends and stay in contact, still loves me and blabla. \nYesterday I told her I thought it fair if she at least reimbursed me half the plane ticket cost, since they're non refundable, non transferrable, and she's disallowing me to go. I haven't talked to the hosting friend yet. She thinks this \"absurd\", that I would even ask.\n\nI have a couple of days time. Am I wrong in wanting her to reimburse me? I have all the emotional pain, and now I'm also the idiot who has to cover the costs? I want to go, I'm sure I can handle it. She has plenty of money, so it's definitely not that.\nTL;DR:"}

I had been saying how impressed I was, and he said thank you and said multiple times that he made it himself. \n\nWell, when I got the email the entire document had trademark watermarks all over it. I googled the company, and it's a professional fitness program company. I was confused as to why he said he made it, since I wouldn't have cared if he had just found something. I casually mentioned the watermarks, and he said that he added them. They are apparently for his \"fake\" company. It's just weird.

The interesting thing is that the impetus for me breaking this off is my own guilt.  She isn't asking for more of my time, or anything more then we've been investing over the last 5 months.  On the contrary, my guilt comes from a place that I would rather go on a date with anyone else who I am parallel dating then her.  I recognize that isn't nice to make her a \"back burner\" girl, so I'd love some perspective on how to handle this situation.  \n\nOn one hand, she's not my girlfriend so I don't technically owe her anything.  On the other hand, common decency and my own peace of mind is telling me I should address it.\n\nBonus question: In general, how many interactions with a date require your lack of interest in pursuing the relationship any further to be called out?  I'm new to this.\nTL;DR:"}

Also, I've heard from mutual friends that she's more-or-less checked out of the relationship at this point (and she never mentions him when we're spending time together). The mild flirting and getting to know each other has been great, but I'm at the point now where I'm beginning to wonder whether it's worth wasting my time if she doesn't intend to break it off with him. I could definitely see myself dating this girl seriously under other circumstances, for what it's worth.\n\nMy question is: how do I move forward here? We'll be taking a four-day trip with some friends in the near future (her boyfriend, as usual, will be absent) and will have lots of opportunities to spend time alone. At what point does it make sense to flat-out let her know I'm interested and ask her how she feels (is it wrong to even do so, knowing she's in a relationship)? Do I just make a move (i.e., go in for the kiss if it feels right)? Or just keep hanging out with her and see what happens? I don't exactly want to be the one to break up a relationship, and I think I'd draw the line at helping someone cheat, but this one seems like it's on its last legs.\nTL;DR:"}

I figured it would change with time.\n\nIt hasn't, and when I finally told her how unhappy I was with he fact that there was no longer any sexual contact, she told me she wasn't interested in it anymore. I felt hurt and didn't pursue the topic any further.\n\nEarlier tonight, I got very upset after she started to make some comments (probably in jest) about wanting to have sex with an actor in the movie we were watching. She told me she doesn't want to feel that I'm for in her to have sex with me, and that she doesn't know why things have changed. I said I don't want that either, but it is important to me and that I need to feel like we are working towards a solution.\n\nI don't feel like she is interested in dealing with it, though, and the whole situation has me feeling depressed and ashamed. How do can I talk to her about this when she seems so disinterested in addressing the issue?

At about 1am she receives a call from her dad. I'm watching her face go from drunk and cheerful to full of terror and despair. Her dad had walked into the back yard to find both of her little dogs shredded to bits by coyotes. The rest of the night was a complete disaster, consisting of me trying to comfort her and get her to go to sleep. When we woke up in the morning, still drunk and emotional, I decided I was going to take her to a baseball game (Giants) to get her mind off of it. so we hop on the Muni, show up to the game about an hour before it is set to start. After making our way into the stadium and out towards the bleachers, I start to notice something strange. There are dogs. Everywhere. In our section. I had never seen dogs at a baseball game, except maybe the occasional help dog. We take our seats and i quickly ask a nearby fan \"what's up with all the dogs today?\" It was \"bring your dog to the game\" day, he replies. I felt awful. There I was with the girl I loved, less than 12 hours after both of her dogs were ripped to pieces, surrounded by dogs and their loving owners. I asked her if she wanted to leave and she said no. I did my best to drown her sorrow in 10 dollar beers and hot dogs.\nTL;DR:"}

I thought she was pulling my leg and forgot about it.\n\nNext one was very recent and is the reason I'm writing this. About a week ago we had a party with our class. The day before I was hanging out with my cousin when Jane came up again. He asked if I liked her, I said yes. He also said that she likes me too. I would believe him, but during the party pretty much nothing happened. Apart from dancing one time together, neither of us said or did anything that would indicate us liking each other.\n\nI'm torn. I want to ask her out, but maybe they were just making fun of me? I don't think anyone knows about my crush apart from my cousin. We're all as a class going to meet in a week. We both be going to the same school, but we will meet more rarely, so I really feel like this is my last chance. I'm not the most social guy so I have no idea these things go.

Also, he's sweet and relatively sane.\n\nMy issue is this: How should I go about asking about intentions regarding dating and where we stand with one another? I know I could just blurt it out, but we talk to each other on facebook a lot more. I don't know if this would be a better thing saved for face-to-face on one of our date days, or if it could be broached over facebook. \n\nHe's admitted to liking me, likes having me sleep over and even just be around when he's busy studying, and thinks I'm the bee's knees.

She lauded at them...but then after a few more, she said..\"I don't really get these jokes..I'm not certain what a hipster is.\" So..she was just laughing to make me feel good but having to explain hipster was rough.

I've been trying to climb the restaurant ladder for about a year at that time the traditional way (start as a dishwasher and learn hands-on). I had already learned a lot, and also being a bit of a narcissist prick, I loved to show off my new-found culinary chops to my layman friends. \n\nSo we had planned a barbecue one night and I had been drinking a fair amount. Eager to assert my perceived mastery of the kitchen, I offered (i.e. demanded) to be allowed to prepare the whole spread. My friends agreed. And so, I self-styled master chef, set to work. I began with the mashed potatoes first; dicing each spud into easy to boil cubes. This procedure had the additional benefit of showing off what I thought were my ninja-like knife skills. I began to carry on a conversation with one of my buddies (who was in another room) and began to focus less on the razor-sharp hunk of steel I was irresponsibly wielding. Until I felt a sharp pain shoot up from my left thumb. Apparently while talking, I continued dicing and had added the tip of the digit to the potatoes for that extra kick. The cutting board was covered in an astounding amount of Jack Daniels ridden blood, and there on the board was the piece of the thumb, complete with a tiny clipping of the nail. SHIT. I mopped the blood up the best I could and slipped into the bathroom to patch myself up. I left the thumb-tip on the cutting board. \n\nBy the time I staunched the bleeding, I found that someone had finished cooking for me. The alienated piece of flesh was no where to be found. Later on, however, somebody did encounter the nail clipping in the potatoes...\nTL;DR:"}

While I'm down here, I hope to travel around South America a bit, since I have never been here (I am from the US), and I'm not sure the next time I will be here.  I am hoping to do so with one of my roommates [20 F].  However, we have another roommate [23 M].  But we don't exactly want to travel with him.\n\nTo put it lightly, he's a bit of a downer.  With anger issues.  We've known each other for about a month now, and in that time he's managed to offend both of us to the point that we do what we can to avoid being around him, his anger, and the way he seems to suck the energy and happiness out of the room.  We've tried inviting him to outings to be nice and make him happy, but always ends up ruining the night by storming out of the room and requiring a discussion telling him how great he is and how much we want him there through bared teeth.  I want to help him, but I barely know him, and I'm also trying to enjoy myself while I'm here.\n\nSo here's the issue.  I want to travel with my other roommate, but we don't know how to tell him that we don't want him to come with us.  I can deal with him during a night out on the town, but I can't deal with that while traveling to another country (I barely have enough serotonin for myself).  I guess we're just looking for a way to politely ask him not to come that won't result in an all out screaming match.  And I guess I've been wondering...are we in the wrong for not wanting him to come?  Any advice would be great.\nTL;DR:"}

He initiated all the flirting, and I was attracted to him so I reciprocated.\n\nSo, when the party was over and everyone went to bed, we ended up staying up for 2 more hours just talking. Somehow that transitioned to kissing and almost-but-not-quite sex (no condom).  \n\nAt the next party, which was a little over a week ago, we actually had sex, which was great, but now I'm just confused. I'm really new to the idea of casual sex, so I can't figure out if this guy actually likes me, or if he just wanted to fuck me. The obvious solution to that is to talk to him about it, but I don't have his phone number and I think I'd weird him out if I got his number from my friend's boyfriend. Or I could wait until another party happens, which could be this weekend or next. I don't really know what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

Along comes this acquaintance I've had for a couple of years. I talked to her here and there, but now we sit next to each other in class, and somehow I didn't realise before how great she is. She will go along with almost any joke I make, she is totally down for watching any and all movies and TV shows (I even wrote her a list of what I recommend which she has been working through lmao), and she's just stunning. And the insane thing is, she's the one who seems to initiate conversation with me almost everyday. I've never had a girl show this level of interest before.\n\nAnd it scares me. Like, what if this girl does actually have feelings for me? We have flirted like hell in class before, and I'm pretty sure we both know what's going on at this point. But I have no idea how to handle it. I've never been in this position before. I've thought about it for so long that it becoming reality scares the shit out of me. What if I fuck up somehow? How am I gonna have a functioning relationship when my parents are overprotective as hell? What if my parents don't like her, or hers don't like me? And hell, it's obvious to everyone that I'm punching way above my weight here, so I'll have those comments to look forward to. Maybe it's just that I'm scared of opening up to someone.

I was honest with him because there really isn't a good excuse for being late to a meeting you requested.  He gave me a big speech told me to be angry about it for the day and said the essence of \" It's okay to make mistakes dont let this happen again and the pain and anger you feel  now should remind you why you shouldnt be late\".

She dismissed it as that it was just for helping change the headlights on her car one time. \n\nAnyway Mary went upstairs to grab her purse and while the mother and I were alone she began asking me questions about if I went to church, how often I went to church, which church I went to, my job, what my job entailed, if I was happy there etc. Which I just brushed off as typical parent wanting to know more about a friend of her kid. \n\nWe went out, had a good time. 2 of my friends needed to use the bathroom by the time we dropped her off and apparently couldn't hold it so they went back into Mary's house and while they were all preoccupied with the family dog the mother came up to me and tried to clarify that what she had told me earlier about Mary always talking about me was simply an overstatement 'she talks about a lot of people.' That's when I first became a tad suspicious but I decided to help her out and replied 'Yeah, well she's just a good person, she's got a great heart.' Her mom then put her hand on my arm and whispered to me 'I'm so glad you said that.'\n\nSo am I reading into this too much or is there something going on here and she's been talking about me in a 'I have a crush on this guy' kind of way to her mom?\nTL;DR:"}

Here's some background-I was baptized Roman Catholic and I attended church and church school as a kid, mostly because my parents wanted me to-I went through First Communion, Confession, and was confirmed a couple years ago. I have always had trouble believing in all of the stories I've heard through the Bible and from the hardcore Christians that will go off for 30 minutes if you so much as speak about atheism. I wasn't exactly forced into the religion-my parents aren't strict religious people, my dad is actually Episcopalian-we haven't been to church as a family in forever, usually only going on Christmas and Easter. Anyways, I've been considering converting to atheism more and more lately-but my question is if I should convert to atheism before really giving Christianity a chance. I do pray a few times a week, but I haven't had anything really special happen. I don't want to convert to atheism because of the religious people that discourage me of following catholicism because of their ridiculous ways of trying to bring hell onto you if you don't believe in God-I think that if I do make the decision to convert, it should be for the religion itself. So what I'm asking is for some stories from religious and atheist people to kind of help me make my decision-im not saying make my decision for me, but I want to know other people's experiences with atheism before I make that decision.\nTL;DR:"}

Not Sure if I Should Give It to Her\nPOST: I've been seeing this girl pretty often for the past month. We have a lot in common and after we both opened up to each other last night, I decided to buy her a little gift this morning. She likes coffee and I bought her a $10 K Cup refill pack. I thought it would be nice, but nothing over the top. However, I do believe that she didn't buy me anything for Christmas and I feel conflicted.\n\nSee, I was a narcissist, douche, dick, manipulative, attention seeking, insecure guy until recently. It came to my attention after starting a new job and I've been working on it ever since. One of the things I've worked on is reflecting on past relationships to prevent further instances of being a narcissist. So, when I bought that little gift for her, I began to realize that for a good portion of my last relationship, I used gifts, trips, and favors to manipulate my ex into believing I was the perfect guy that was impervious of being dumped because of how perfect I was to her. \n\nNow I feel like I might be doing the same thing again and I really don't want to exhaust someone like I did with my ex. I can already see that she's really into me and I don't want to manipulate her like I did with my ex. I really like her and I don't want to act the way I have in the past.\nTL;DR:"}

My ex and I have dated for only a few months we were super happy and in love with each other and felt no need to hide how we felt. This happened until the last week and a half before we broke up where she suddenly started to act cold and distant out of nowhere. Turns out she had cheated on me with her ex boyfriend (they dated for 2 years prior to me) and then we broke up. We broke up literally a week and a half ago because of what she did. After hearing the news I was obviously heartbroken but I knew it wasn't going to be the end of the world. Fast-forward to today, my ex calls me up telling me she just took a pregnancy test and that it might be mine or the other ex's and is planning to abort it by the end of the month. To be honest with myself and everyone I still have deep feelings for her despite what she did to me that one night, is it wrong and dumb? Yes. But I still want to be there for her as a friend throughout this ordeal. Am I looking to rekindle the relationship? Probably. But this has become such a shit storm in itself that I'm confused and worried for her and myself as to what I can do to make her feel better and remedy this entire situation. So guys what can I do or should I do? I really want to help her because I still want her to be a part of my life even as a friend and it feels wrong to just leave her when she's going through this by herself.\nTL;DR:"}

I've made comments in posts concerning Learning Disabilities (I have many) and even though I had explained my remediation, everyone seems to not take anything I say seriously. I've made comments on posts concerning life problems and triumphs, made educated guesses, and attempted to discuss subjects and politics but i'm treated all the same.\n\nI understand that the Reddit community's demographic dominantly includes men and women ranging from the ages of 18-25, so my question is, what do you all have against people my age? I understand, I hate most people my age because a lot of teenagers are in fact, utterly retarded.  What I don't understand is why am I judged incompetent because of my age, even if I show otherwise?

I wouldn't be anxious about it if I didn't know that he's still working on whether or not he really wants to be in a LTR. I just really hope he's not texting some other girl.

He slams his fist into my desk, leans in over me while yelling and often puts down my opinion in front of others. Other colleagues seem to value my opinion/input and I've never had a negative review. My manager offered to change me to a project area.\n\nSo with the advice from the last post, I decided to push the issue once more with HR... It was not a productive meeting. They met with both of us separately and basically said, \"You guys need to stick with your job description and if there are issues, talk to you managers and not each other.\"  They were not interested in hearing about how he acts during meetings, how he's endangered our project deliverables on multiple occasions, or how his negativity and anger issues have affected our team.  \n\nI'm feeling pretty discouraged because they were not supportive of my proactive work style at all. I'm the kind of person where if something is lacking, I jump in to help the team get organized or back on track. I'll do work outside of my job description if it helps get the project done. This attitude has made me successful and well liked with my other colleagues. \n\nJack is the only one who seems to feel the need to belittle my opinions or make negative comments about my work, but it felt like HR was telling me to step back and just do what I'm paid to do so that I limit the times where I might run into Jack. They didn't really address his bullying or aggressive behaviour at all and kind of made it sound like it was my fault.  :/\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do now. \n\nI could still change teams, as my manager offered.  I could stay and see what happens (a few of my colleagues think that the company will not act on Jack's bad behaviour until its time for annual reviews). Or, I could leave for a different job.\n\nRight now, I'm feeling super disrespected by management and HR and it's very discouraging.\nTL;DR:"}

He took us on a golf cart adventure throughout the festival grounds. Unfortunately the tracking signal went dead as we arrived to our destination. Good guy Bruce ended up downloading the app himself and allowed us to scope out the 5 employees working the location. After many attempts we finally fessed up to the workers. I explained (lied) that an iPhone is forever the original owners and that AT&T will know no matter what/where it is. \"You might go to jail.\" This thoroughly freaked out one guy who then pretended he found it by the trash can. \"Oh yea it was just sitting there.\" No action was taken since we couldn't prove he took it.

She never does this (as far as we know) when we aren't outside with her. For the first time (as far as I know and for at least a year) she made a break for it through the fence and couldn't come back through. We weren't home (gone for two hours? We never leave her for more than that - either he will take her to work or when I work from home she is with me) and she is allowed to come and go through dog door to our very private, high-fenced yard. Our neighbor grabbed her and kept her for about an hour and she was returned promptly once I came home.\nThis morning I left for work at 9am - dog was fed and happy (she spent the entire afternoon and night with me) - but apparently she somehow got out AGAIN. She ran all the way to the former roommate's house and was found no problem - but what the hell is she doing?

I've always been assertive in letting him know that what he does bothers me, but he doesn't seem to *want* to get the message.\n\nI (like a lot of other people) like having my own personal bubble, which I think is fair enough. Additionally, I went through a traumatic event last year that has made me even more wary and anxious about physical contact (*especially* from men). \n\nI think it could be his way of flirting with me. I don't want to hurt his self-esteem or for him to take it personally, but he needs to know that people have boundaries.

All was well after quitting, but then just a few days ago I get a text message from my ex-coworker asking me if I could cover her shift on Saturday because she's been working 12 days straight and the manager and another employee were on vacation. I was confused because right before I quit, they had hired 2 new people so they couldn't possibly be understaffed. But because I got along well with that coworker, I said yes. I didn't have anything planned that day and it was an opportunity to make a few bucks (I currently don't have a job right now). My coworker said that all my information is still in the system and I would still get paid through direct deposit.\n\nSo my question is...if all my info is still in the employee system/register or whatever, and I can still get paid like I was still working there, am I technically still employed at the store? The owner called me on my last shift telling me that if I ever wanted to go back, he'll gladly give me a spot (the store is a chain, but can be franchised, it is not a family/locally run business). If I get a background check when applying for a job, would I come up as still being employed? I just want to make sure.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How much do I (23m) reveal to my ex-girlfriend (23f) about the reason we broke up?\nPOST: I've had a two year relationship with this girl. It was really awesome for a while, but it has hit some rough patches along the way. We've split up but have still been talking and plan to talk about the future of our relationship soon.\n\nOne thing that I've realized was a source of anxiety for me is the state of her teeth. For awhile I never realized them but over our time together I did sometimes notice that they were discolored, like kind of stained. Especially in a space between two of her front teeth it just looks really dark, like she hasn't flossed in awhile. Sometimes I would get distracted by her teeth when talking to her. She mentioned to me that her mom once told her that she thinks she has stained teeth. At that point I didn't let it on that it bothered me at all because it didn't all that much. \n\nAs we kind of started to drift apart and things weren't going as smoothly her teeth really started to bother me more and more. By nature I'm kind of an anxious person (so is she) so sometimes her stained teeth really got to me and just made her mouth seem kind of gross. It really got in the way of our sex life as it acted as a real mental block for me when it came to getting turned on. Even just kissing her sometimes was kind of hard to do and felt awkward.\n\nSo should I tell her any of this? I would obviously try to say it in the nicest way possible. I just kind of feel like she deserves to know. At the same time I'm pretty sure she knows that her teeth are discolored since she uses toothpaste with extra whitening. I don't know how much she can actually have done to fix it, and I'm not even sure it needs fixing. I feel like a shallow dick, but I just couldn't stop thinking about it sometimes. I feel like I should tell her so that she at least knows and can try to fix it if she wants. At the same time I feel like I just shouldn't say anything because it would just hurt her and perhaps won't be beneficial in the long run for her to hear that from me.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\nTL;DR:"}

I was married for 18 years (together for over 20) and this is the first person I've dated exclusively since my divorce. My marriage died a slow painful death and over the course of around 6 years I became really anxious and worried all the time. At times I would lose a lot of weight, not sleep well and always felt like I was on edge with worry. Those times were the saddest times of my life.\n\nNow that I am dating again I've started to feel that way again. Because this relationship is new, I know there's a lot of uncertainty and you never know how things will end up, that's just part of a new relationship and I'm aware of that. The problem is the uncertainty of it all makes me feel exactly like I did when my marriage was bad. I feel like I have no control over it and it's feeding my anxiety. I've lost weight, feel anxious/depressed and generally uncomfortable. It's like the uncertainty of a new relationship has triggered feelings from the past and I'm not sure how to handle it.\n\nMy marriage ended mid 2014 so it's not like I didn't wait a while before dating again. This isn't something I imagined would happen.\nTL;DR:"}

Sometimes he'll turn on the lamp beside his bed, but that doesn't happen too often. Back before we started dating, I didn't care too much... But now that we are, it makes me feel hella self-conscious. It doesn't happen as often now (still does quite a bit, though) but that doesn't change the fact that it almost always used to happen before. I feel like maybe him being um, to put it nicely, \"unimpressed\" with my face might have something to do with it. Also good (or embarrassing) to note that he has a \"thing\" for doggy.\nTL;DR:"}

This 4th of July weekend we planned on spending some much needed quality time together. \n\nUnfortunately, his family home had a devastating house fire a few days ago, leaving him with no room and most of his stuff and valuables ruined. I of course invited him to stay with me for as long as he wanted/needed which he would have taken me up on had his keys not been lost/melted in the mess, leaving him with no transportation and no easy way to get here due to an inconvenient distance. So basically, I'm spending this holiday weekend alone.\n\nI wish that I could do more for him, as in helping with the practical things like going through his things and helping him make the list for the insurance people about everything lost, but I can't. I also wish that we were able to have some quality alone time together so that I can comfort him and at least give him a 'safe place' to be upset about it instead of him trying to act tough about it at his relative's home and in front of his younger brothers. He has said he's okay, just annoyed because of losing the things. I understand this, but it's a big loss for him, and not just because of the material things. \n\nI feel like I should be doing more for him at this time, but I am limited with what I can do. I have never experienced anything like this and have not really had to support someone through it, either. I am also feeling a little selfish for having a pity-party about the lost weekend, even though this was definitely out of our control and a truly horrible thing. \n\nHow can I 'be there' for him when I can't physically be there, and how can I feel better about not being able to do everything I would like to for him and his family?\n\nMy apologies if this seems like a trivial thing to need advice on, but I'm just trying to do the right thing.\nTL;DR:"}

Two years ago, my partner (who is not bi-sexual) fell into a massively co-dependent relationship with her best friend (who deals heavily with same sex attraction). This led to them having an on/off physical relationship which ended about a year before my partner and I started dating. \n\nI know that my partner has moved on and has no desire to fall back into temptation of ever being physical or being too close to her best friend again, but while my partner still lives with her best friend (along with other roommates), and while I know the best friend has moved on as well, I must shamefully admit that I cannot fully trust the best friend. I often think that if the best friend was out of the picture, I would not have to fight the memory of their past. My partner always tells me it will better show the power of forgiveness if she and her best friend can remain in each other's community and lives. While it took me a little while, I can understand this side of it, but there is a strong tension in my flesh not trusting the best friend, but wanting to as she is dear to my love and me.\n\nI just needed to process, be challenged, and hear the advice of non-biased parties. Are they playing with fire? Is it wrong for me to want the best friend out of the picture? Is it a red flag that my girlfriend's first reaction is to defend their relationship and not try to make sure I'm comfortable, but calls out my hesitancies and insecurities? Are they wrong? I suppose anytime you aren't pursuing love for someone, you're wrong.\n\nThe bottom line is, I want to pursue health in this. I don't want to dismiss my feelings. I want this to all be healthy.

In addition to the obvious reasons, we have stressful jobs.  I am doing my residency in family medicine, and this being my last year, my time is pretty much consumed by finding a job and studying for my board exam.  He works for a small engineering firm that takes on big projects and is understaffed, resulting in him working 70-80 hour weeks sometimes.  We also have very different personalities and different ways of dealing with people and situations.  When depressed, I bury myself in netflix and reddit, and I have a tendency to stuff my feelings until I\"m about to explode.  He, on the other hand, becomes more outwardly tempermental, loses his temper, and becomes harsh and overly critical.  Long distance plus stressful work environments plus both of us being depressed = not a good combination.  I was considering suggesting to him that we take an 'unofficial break.'  This would involve us just taking a few weeks up to a month or two to just focus on ourselves and not worry about calling the other or trying to make the other happy.  I feel like I need it, because my depression in the setting of him being tempermental and harsh leads to me resenting him, and I don't want to end up hating him.  We were very good for each other at one point and I believe we still have that potential.  So my question is, is there any benefit to taking a break in a serious relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

He will not go down on me unless I shave but he flat out refuses to shave his downstairs. He will trim up his pubic hair every two or three months but he will not shave it on a consecutive basis.

It made me so mad. I even said \"Okay, but I am not going to go down on your unless you stayed shaved too,\" and he just said okay like I wasn't going to go through with it. Personally, I don't care if he has pubic hair or not, and I am not opposed to keeping my downstairs trimmed either. It is just the concept that I don't understand. How is it okay for you to have long pubic hair but I am expected to keep it shaved? \n\nAnyway, I really need advice on how to communicate to my boyfriend that it makes me angry that he expects me to shave my downstairs in order to get oral but he doesn't have to do anything to his junk in order to receive oral. \n\nJUST TO BE CLEAR: I like to trim my downstairs and keep it short. I totally understand why any man would want me to keep my pubic hair short. I am pissed off because he can't return the favor, not because he wants me to shave.\nTL;DR:"}

We have talked about it I can't even remember how many times but it seems to be the only problem we can't resolve. I have never had an orgasm while having sex with him and we have had a lot of sex over the time we have been dating. We also don't have sex very much and when we do it doesn't last as long as I'd like. Basically, I want him to try harder and he says that he has been yet I haven't seen any changes in the past 6 months since we first talked about it. Even yesterday I tried to initiate sex and gave him a killer blow job but after the sex was super awkward and neither of us finished. \n\nSo my question basically comes down to sex or love? I feel like I'm going to be the one to have to settle when it comes to the bedroom but I'm worried that in the years to come I will end up regretting choosing love over sex and I will stay unfulfilled sexually. What can I do? I don't want to break up over sex but I really want to explore more sexually and no matter how many times i bring it up with him nothing changes.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I [30/m] got ghosted by fwb [31/f] after 3 months.\nPOST: I get it, these things happen. She went on a work trip for like 5 days during which we had no contact. A couple days before that things were a bit weird...she just didn't seem as into it. However, when she gets back I call her on Monday evening after work at 8 p.m., she says she'll call me back after dinner but then just never does. It's only the next day, so who knows...but I'm pretty sure I got ghosted.\n\nBackground: Spent about 3-4 nights a week together and everything seemed fine. She knows that I've wanted a relationship for about 2 months now, but that I made my peace that she didn't want to date me that way. She acknowledged feelings off and on, but essentially stated that she didn't want them and successfully had suppressed them about a month back.\n\nUltimately, I'd just like a chance to talk to her and see her one last time, and have a positive frame to ending things and just saying goodbye. I don't want to know her reasoning for her feelings changing, it's just that it sucks to spend 3 months with someone and develop a bond with them only to one day see them for the last time and not even know. It's kind of driving me crazy and I don't really know how to mentally process the fact that I can't have resolution to everything.\n\nI've probably done this to women about 5-6 times in the last ten years. I never knew how it felt...I haven't said anything to her at all because I don't want to come across dramatic, but this is seriously one of the most maddening things I've experienced in the context of a dating relationship.\n\nShe seems like a flight risk at this point and I want to end things no matter what, just in a positive manner. I have no hard feelings. I just really want to see her again...anyone experienced this before and possibly want to give some advice?\nTL;DR:"}

I feel terrible\nPOST: I am having a fairly laxed saturday night and I decided to go get some Mcdonalds. So I did and on my way back I am no farther than a block away from home and a cat runs out in the middle of the road so I hit the brakes hard  enough to avoid the cat as it passes from right to left. I could tell that I wasn't going to hit it so I sped up just a bit. All the sudden I see movement on the right and its a large black dog that was chasing the cat across the street. I didn't have enough time to slow down and i was told never to swerve for an animal because it can mean my death or injury. After surely killing this dog (I was going somewhere around 32mph) I pulled over ahead of the terrible situation and got out to go back but I couldn't. I couldn't bring myself to go back and see the animal or even confirm it was dead. And then I looked at the front of my car to see what kind of damage it had done. There was a fairly large (two balled fists together) dent in the front panel under the light. Then I just got in and went home. I got my food and went inside and just sat here for a few moments. I felt seriously bad, I didn't know what I could possibly do. I want back outside to look at the damage again, noticed an even larger dent on my right front panel behind the front wheel. It is actually a large dent! That is a bummer big time considering I drive a really nice car and I am only 23 and paid for it. but I felt bad for the pup and bad for the owners. I couldn't stop thinking about that. I have calmed down a little. I don't want to call the cops I just don't feel like dealing with them or going back to show them where it is. Now I know that it was partially their fault they didn't keep their pup locked up but I hate that it happened.\nTL;DR:"}

I was bored and decided to do something while I waited for my bus. So I took food coloring out of my kitchen and messed around with it. As I was playing around with the food coloring, my mom came downstairs and I hid the food coloring in my pockets. She told me the bus was here and I went to school. So now I'm in gym class and I'm just running around playing with my friends. Suddenly, we hear the coach's whistle blow. He yells and tells us all to stop moving. We all freeze. He then asks if we've seen anybody hurt or injured. He tells us that there's blood all over the gym floor and that somebody might be seriously hurt. He asks again if we've seen anybody hurt. Somebody near me saw that my pants were really red around my pocket and told the coach that I was bleeding. So the coach walks over to me and sees a bunch of red seeping through my pocket. He asks me if I'm hurt and I say no. Then I remember that I was playing with food coloring earlier. I take the food coloring out of my pocket and realize that the cap wasn't fully closed. The coach looks at me and tells me that I'm in big trouble. After that, all the kids went outside and I had to help the custodians clean the gym floor. My mom was called and I was sent home.

A few weeks ago, he basically wasn't replying enthusiastically to my texts, we didn't have sex and I thought he was going to break up with me.\n\nHe text me last night just saying that he's really sorry he's been quiet the last few weeks... Then he ended the text by saying that when he gets low he shuts himself off from the world... But asked me to please not take it personally and that he'll be back.\n\nI'm not really sure what to reply to that... Was thinking something along the lines of 'I believe you when you say that you really like me. So I know you'll be back and I'm not taking it personally. Do whatever it is you need to do to feel on top of things and I'll be here when you're back  :)' \n\nIs that okay? \n\nAnd also, going forward, how can I support him? I felt a little hurt when he just changed how he was with me and I would obviously like him to talk to me if he is feeling low... But I realise that anxiety and depression aren't simple. \nIt also worries me that this is an excuse to end things...\nTL;DR:"}

I've recently graduated and am currently home applying for jobs while she'll be going back to school in the fall. While at home, we live about 2 hours away (driving time) and are both car-less, but we manage to see each other around every 2-3 weeks via public transportation, albeit requiring a lot of time. We saw each other often for the three weeks of school we had left before going home for the summer. Currently she is working while I am studying for my MCAT so I can apply to medical school in the future. \n\nI want her to be happy and she's done nothing wrong, but sometimes I feel like I just don't care enough. For example, I'll get a text and even if I'm not busy I don't respond until later. I get a snapchat and don't have a reply. Even as I'm going about my day, I never find myself questioning how my SO's day is or what she is doing. But on the seldom occasion that we're together, I feel great and emotionally available for her. She will be going back to the school in the fall which means I won't see her until the winter, and I can't help but think the physical distance will just make me more apathetic as it is doing to me right now. Not to mention, the road ahead of me career-wise will undoubtedly mean more separation. \n\nThis is my first relationship, the first time I've went on a date with someone. We've never fought, we've never argued. She was there to support me when my grandfather died a month ago. But if something like that happened to my SO, I feel like I wouldn't be know how to be as supportive from a distance. It just seems that if I do not physically see someone, then I become less concerned with how they are doing. I don't want to string her alongside the long path I see ahead only for it to get worse, and I'm not confident that I know how to make it work right now.\nTL;DR:"}

I just recently got a new job in a bakery at a grocery store to help my rent while I'm in school, because let's face it financial aid can't pay for everything, and not long after working they have hired a new girl in a different department. Right off the bat I noticed that she was very cute and very nice and just seems like someone I'd like to get to know, and if it helps I'm pretty sure we have both caught each other staring a couple of times. \nNow here's where I need your help r/dating_advice I'm being moved to the morning shift in a couple of days and won't get as much face time with her, usually I like to get to know a girl some before I ask them out but in this case that window is closing fast so I was wondering if any of you knew a way I could ask her to a \"date\" outside of work (not a real date but just something where we could hang out some and maybe lead to actual dates). As of now the best that I can come up with is to ask her out to a local coffee shop where they have games, movies, coffee, alcohol, the essentials. \n\nSo my main question is do any of you know of a better way to go about this? Anything will help whether it be how to start it off (which is where I am most lost) or better ideas of where to go\nTL;DR:"}

Is this normal?\nPOST: I live in a foreign country, and will likely continue to live where I am now for at least half a decade, maybe more. Because of cultural differences it seems incredibly unlikely that a relationship would ever work out with a local girl, much less that we'd have much in common. I'm not ruling it out though.\n\nSo I've been going to local meetings of foreigners, and have pretty much met all the local expats. I'm a pretty shy person and I'm sick of going out to the bars where we meet, but I'm making friends and occasionally having opportunities to hang out in more intimate places, which is nice.\n\nBut a couple days ago, I started feeling really worried about ever having a girlfriend. As I said, I've pretty much met all the foreigners in the area, and among them, I only really immediately felt comfortable around one. Turned out we have a lot in common, too. We went on a couple of what I thought were dates, just us two, I was starting to feel infatuated so I mentioned how comfortable I feel...and she apologized and told me she's gay.\n\nThis doesn't really bother me, I was getting a little carried away, and it's silly to expect anything so soon anyway...okay, it kind of does bother me, only because I've always sort of wished I *were* a woman, but that isn't my issue.\n\nThe thing is, as I've said I've pretty much met everyone I can, and if anything I want to go to less of these awkward (for me) meetups, but I haven't met anyone I felt I'd like to date. It seems like there simply isn't a suitable person in my city, and it's difficult to imagine going the next five years without at least pursuing romance. Is it normal to feel this way? Should I try to be more open-minded about meeting local women? Should I try being a bit more friendly with some of the other foreign women and see if something might develop, even if we don't have a lot in common on the surface?\nTL;DR:"}

We were long distance for a large period of that time and have been living together for about 1.5 years now.\n\nMy BF plays MMOs (we actually met on one) and it is of the nature that you cannot pause the game.  So for instance, tonight, he started playing at 9PM, and said he \"might\" be finished at 12AM but he's not sure.  If I try to communicate with him, he'll cut me off with \"this isn't a good time\".\n\nWe spend about an hour or two of couple time together a day.  I've been brainstorming new activities we can do together, such as adult coloring books, or art projects and he doesn't show enthusiasm for any of them.  The only thing he seems to be enthusiastic about in terms of entertainment is gaming and DnD...and sex.\n\nWe had a fight earlier when I said I can't wait until tomorrow where we can spend more time together.  I planned a thrift store date where   He became really defensive and said we already spend a lot of time together.

I want kids and don't want to move there.\nPOST: So I've started dating a new girl. She seems great, the kind of girl where I feel like I've known her 10x longer than I have, everything feels good and comfortable and fun and... well, all the good stuff you want from a new relationship. She acts in ways that make me happy, she has similar attitudes to things, she's cute and I'm really attracted to her. Bedroom stuff is great too. In short, she personally is fantastic.\n\nHowever, she has 3 kids from 2 previous relationships. She also lives ~40 minutes away from me, and the drive isn't a particularly nice one (bad UK back-roads).\n\nThe kids themselves aren't a problem in themselves (a previous girlfriend had one child, wasn't a problem), but I feel like it's a lot to take on with three and a lot of potential complexity. More importantly, I think I want my own children and bringing another 1 or 2 children into a family of 5 seems a lot. It's an early stage to be considering this, so it seems like an odd thing to bring up with her, but I figure if it's a blocker it's something I need to tackle early.\n\nSimilarly I don't feel comfortable with the idea of, long term, moving to her town. I would really struggle to find work, and it's just not somewhere I want to live. Equally, though, I don't feel comfortable with the idea of potentially, in future, asking her to uproot from her friends and family and come to live with me. Financially that would make significantly more sense, as I own a bigger house than she rents, but the far more important aspects to me are the fact it would be also moving her children away from their friends at a sensitive age.\n\nI'm having fun with her and enjoy being around her, but I feel a bit like I'm being unfair or \"stringing her along\" if I don't deal with this early knowing that it could be a potential big issue later... how do I handle it? Do I just suck it up and accept that, despite how much I like this girl, the situation means I have to let her go?\nTL;DR:"}

Some people are creative, some people panic when put on the spot and pick an easy overused rule. This was the option I took, stating my rule was to be \"left handed drinking only, or you have to down your drink\". It's actually an horrendously difficult rule to follow for an entire game and a rare concession to the most oppressed in our society, lefties.\n\nThere was no laughter. There was not even groans at me picking such an overused rule. There was just silence. Clearly awkward silence. I'm not sure if people actually parted aside or if my realisation caused me have some kind of horror moving 'zooming in' effect. There, smiling awkwardly at me, was my friend with only one arm. Her right arm. \n\nWe'd been friends all through university, I simply don't think of her as \"the girl with one arm\", she is just my friend. How I fucked up was by unwittingly drawing attention to it at a party where she was already quite uncomfortable surrounded by people she didn't know very well. She was fine, we giggled about it on later days, but the entire tone of that party seemed to change after that - the drinking game was already a desperate attempt to get it started.\n\nI got very drunk in response and on my way home urinated on a cat: it was hiding in the bush I chose as a public toilet and ran out, only once I had finished (the filthy bastard), looking soggy and cross.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Possible link between stress levels and pubic hair on urinals?\nPOST: Something I have been observant of over the last few years, mostly because I have been in charge of keeping public restrooms clean, is the number of pubic hair on the edge of toilet seats (specifically in men's restrooms on urinals.) \nThe number of hairs on urinals tends to vary based on location of the restroom. From my observations I have noticed that places where people might be experiencing higher stress level, have more hairs on the urinals. Universities, work places, and gas stations/pit stops seem to have more hair on the toilets than places people go to relax or have fun (such as amusement parks, home environments, and the water park I have worked at for six summers now.) \n**My theory is that when men are stressed or tense, they scratch their scrotum more vigorously while they urinate than if they were at home or somewhere fun and relaxing.** This vigorous scratching would cause pubic hair to be pulled out and to fall on the edge of the urinal. Factors to take into account would be how busy a specific restroom/urinal is, how often the restroom is thoroughly cleaned, age of the toilet users, etc.\nDo you redditors think this theory is accurate? Or is my pee-pee fetish getting the best of me?\nTL;DR:"}

The relationship was going great - his family loved me and we had a ton of similar hobbies. He was absolutely infatuated with me, and showed affection as much as he can. \n\nSleepovers were a regular occurrence and we would do a sleepover at least once a week. One day, we were drinking and went to bed and I had seizure at his house, in his bed. Now, I hadn't had a seizure in years, and I wasn't epileptic - I simply had a chance of getting one if I was sleep deprived. \n\nI was humiliated. My first seizure after three years and it's at my Boyfriend's place! At first, he was completely compassionate. He drove me home, and checked up on me when he could. \n\nHe wanted to talk about what had happened but I shut myself off - I was so scared to talk about it. When we did talk about it three days later, he brought up how scary and terrifying it was which made me even more afraid to talk about it. We agreed that we could try and get over this 'bump'. \n\nHowever, days later, I still felt insecure in the relationship. So I talked to him and we agreed to go on a break for a few days so he could sort out his feelings on the issue. Days later, we met up and he said, \"I'm okay with being in this relationship if you're okay with me being insecure about it.\" \n\nI'm the type of girl who'd rather be single than be insecure in a relationship, so I dumped him on the spot. We agreed to stay friends as we both hadn't foreseen the breakup, especially in this light. We're now friends, however I'm wondering if we may be able to date again in the future?\n\nWe have very similar interests and the relationship was great before the seizure. Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

I've only used ebay a few times to buy books so I know nothing in this area.  \n\nHas anyone else had to go through this? If so, what did you do?

I did not set up fun new things for us to do to keep things interesting. The other reason being is that I did not support her passion of vegetarianism.

She said that she lost her identity because everyone saw us as \"the couple\" and not as our individual selves. She said it was her and not me. She felt guilty because I tried giving her everything and she couldnt give back anything. She said she wasn't ready to be in a relationship right now. She said she needed space.

Now perhaps my biology teacher at the time could have done a better job, but even after passing high school bio I did not grasp the concept of evolution. \n\nIt wasn't until I took an intro to anthro course in my freshman year of college that I had my mind blown wide open on the topic. My professor discussed Mendel and Darwin's work in detail. He went beyond just casting definitions and punnet squares at us and really explained the significance of their work in a way that related to humans. He shared with us fossil dig sites and told us about Lucy and other amazing discoveries about how wonderful the natural history of our species is. We learned about the differences between \"cave men\" and modern humans. This is material that is not common knowledge or included in standard high school science classes, yet is directly related to the opinions of the adults those schools produce. \n\nThrough this branch of science we have dug up the bones of our ancestors and held them in our hands.

Relationship with my wife, Work, everyday pressures, that sort of thing.\n\nI'm seeing her for anxiety/depression that stems from childhood trauma. I don't know if its helping? I get a lot of anxiety about going, but when I talk its usually good for a while, and then I wonder why I am going in the first place because we aren't really making much progress.\n\nShe gives some good insight sometimes, the latest gem being \"its almost like you are comfortable in your being uncomfortable\" (meaning I am in a shitty spot right now but its easier to stay in that spot than it is to get out).\nAll I know is that not much has changed besides me gaining weight. I blame that on the anxiety/depression and actually having to talk to someone about those things. Fast food and no exercise is why I am gaining weight, before I started counseling I was at least going on 3mi long runs every other day or so, and I was motivated to eat better. Maybe realizing my depression has given me an excuse to not care as much? I don't know, there are a lot of variables.\n\nIs a month too soon to know if counseling works or not?\n\nI feel like if this is not a good fit, I will probably not search for another for a while.\nTL;DR:"}

My grandmother was a good grandmother but not a very good person. She was cheating on my grandfather with a convict who would show her a good time and have sex with her, since my grandfather had a bad back.\n\nWhen I was 9 there was a house fire at 2am and my grandmother was mysteriously at the grocery store. Unfortunately my grandfather and cousin did not make it out.\n\nThree days after the funeral she moved in with the convict and started drinking heavily and doing drugs. With the insurance money she received she bought a new house and had about $100,000 left over. She spent all that money in 2 years with the convict, buying him motorcycles, cars, tools, and whatever else he wanted but never used.\n\nMy mom had a fall out with my grandmother after years of trying to forgive and see her side of things. The final straw came when my sister moved in with my grandmother and became pregnant.\n\nShe has been addicted to drinking for a few years and gets the shakes when she doesn't have a drink. She goes through a half gallon of vodka every couple days and her liver is just shot. She's dying because of her drinking and I truly believe she want to die.\n\nBecause of my moms fall out with her, I never see her. I live under my parents roof so I have to follow their rules. I'd see my grandmother every now and then and she'd cry and tell me to come visit, but now she's dying and I don't know what to do. I feel like I should go see her, but I'm not sure if that's what I should do and I don't know what I would even begin to say to her. I'm content with her death and this whole thing just fills me with sadness, and I just want some unbiased opinions.\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend has always known I've been more sexually experienced (I can count the guys I have slept with on one hand). I have never once cheated or even thought about cheating on him or any other boyfriends I had. I care about my boyfriend, he is my best friend and he means the world to me. But last night, he asked me details about what guys I had ever slept with or even kissed. I told him this conversation would only lead to jealousy and we shouldn't talk about it. But he insisted I tell him, and so I did.\n\nHe now refuses to talk to me, and says I'm such a whore. \n\nI slept with these guys before I even knew him.

I am doing work with a university 1000 miles away for a year, and we have been seeing each other about every 6-8 weeks. I assume I got pregnant during a visit in September, and I had a miscarriage during the later part of November. It was extremely painful and scary, and since I had no idea I was pregnant (I had an IUD) to begin with, my grieving process started much later.\n\nI did not tell him about it until the next visit after it occurred. He listened, but didn't console me physically or emotionally. He basically said \"that's too bad\" and said he only had experience with couples who had miscarriages during planned (and wanted) pregnancies. He doesn't seem to understand how painful this is for me no matter how greatly I articulate it.\n\nWe had come to the conclusion previously that we wouldn't have a child, and I think that is affecting his reaction. He already knew we would not ever have a child so this is no big deal to him. But even though I had no idea I was pregnant, didn't plan to ever be pregnant, etc it's extremely traumatic for me and I would like his support. \n\nHow do I explain to him that he should at least comfort me and validate that I'm grieving?\nTL;DR:"}

My SO is now baby obsessed and wants to have one ASAP (well 6 in all, but I've now bartered down to 4!). I want to have a family with her (she is the one) but not yet. She wants one now and it's all she ever talks about. \n\nShe's recently got a good job in another country (I'm still residing in London) and I'm trying my hardest to get a job out there to be there with her. The problem is she's putting so much pressure on me getting a high paying job (wants me to be on 100,000+ by the time I'm 30). It's not helping that her current job is recruitment and she looks through hundreds of young big shots everyday (I'm a free lancer). \n\nIs she being unrealistic, or am I being an underachiever? Obviously I'm busting a nut to achieve the goal, but there's a possibility it won't happen, and if it doesn't she'll feel as if she's wasted years of her life on me, and subsequently resent me for delaying her dream. When it comes up in conversation she says: \"You can do it, I know you can, I believe in you\". Do I let her down gently and go down the less intense road with a girl who's not as money and baby obsessed, or just put the blinkers on and go for it. Each road is a gamble, because I may never find a love like her again, or I may end up making her unhappy and resenting me. \n\nEvery opinion is highly appreciated from you guys, because it's like a glitched up carnival loop in my head right now.

For the most part I thought about all of the things you have been saying but I was in denial or shock or something and just didn't want to believe that we are really over.\n\nSo this morning I awoke to find that she never came home last night (since I am still living with her until Sunday when I have the time to move everything out and get help from some friends). This really put things into perspective for me. For all last night, all I could think about was, \"oh god I hope she's not doing anything with anybody\"/\"Maybe she didn't come home because she went home with someone else\"/\"God damn it I just want her to be home so I know she's not doing anything\" and other things like that. But I wouldn't let myself text or call her to find out what she was doing because I didn't want to impede on her \"space.\" This was almost torture and to put myself through that for anything longer than last night would be like self inflicted wounds. So when I awoke I saw baonnnnnnnnn's comment about just letting go and becoming Doc Chubs 2.0, this was what really snapped for me. \n\nSo in conclusion, I have awoken today, I went for a run, did some other work out stuff (which, is unheard of for my fat lazy ass) and after my shower I started packing all of my stuff. I have in the past hour gotten nearly everything of mine out of the apartment and in my car ready to move. I plan on leaving on Sunday still because I have work soon and don't have the time to fully move out. However, once I am out I plan on not talking to her at all for at least a month, unless she contacts me which of course I will be civil and would accept nothing more than a plutonic friendship!\n\nSo I would like to thank everyone who commented, it really did help snap me out of my denial or shock or whatever I was in.

Each of them have different characteristics that carry them to specific schedules in which they are placed to serve as the most harmful to least harmless substances, among other things. \n\nNow, the situation which I would like to purpose is this: \n\nIf these drugs were to be legalized, and corporations were established to sponsor their use in controlled environments, would you vote for/support it? [This] could be an example of what i mean by 'controlled environments'.\n\nSo, I'm aware why most people support it, many think our country should legalize certain types of, if not all drugs (among other things). These people (I'm talking the majority of the people with sensible opinions formed by research etc.) support this for one main reason, they think people should be allowed to do whatever they want to themselves as long as it doesn't hurt other people.\n\nPeople against this movement (if you want to call it that) think that it if the currently legal drugs we know of were to be legalized, could potentially harm others' life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. But, in the hypothetical situation I purposed, most (maybe even all) of these actions that could potentially disrupt one's right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness wouldn't be a problem any more (at least, that's the idea). \n\nI've actually talked to my friends about this, and they think that people should be allowed to do whatever they want. Again though, the point came up that someone that drinks by themselves one night could easily stumble into his/her car and wreck into another and crash and kill that person. Obviously, that situation would be robbing the person who dies of their life.\n\nSo, what do you guys think?\nTL;DR:"}

Yes, girlfriend, 8 years. We've had our ups and downs, no need for a lot of background (unless requested, I guess). She's wanted to get married, to have kids, etc for a long while. I can't see myself, right now, doing any of these things.\n\nI think my resistance comes from a place of selfishness, hence my post here. I love her, I respect her, I don't want to lose her, but we're different enough that I think the relationship would just coast at idle for the rest of our lives, if we were to spend them together. I want someone who's more like me, who's more into the things I'm into without having to bore/force them on them. I want to be legitimately interested in THEIR things. While I'm not likely to find the female version of me (and I sincerely hope to never meet that person, oi), I want them to be independent enough so that when it comes to things we're not mutually keen on, we're perfectly capable of enjoying our own things without having to drag one another though stuff we're not going to enjoy.\n\nI really do care for this person, and my biased thought is: we're not right enough for one another, and it would be better for both of us to find more compatible people. The problem I'm having is twofold: Having met real life people that I just click with better, I feel like maybe I'm experiencing a \"grass is greener\" moment. Given the massive number of people on the earth, there will almost always be someone that will be a better match, so where do you stop? The other side of this coin is that I don't want to hurt her, and there will definitely be a lot of hurt involved.\n\nSo what do I do? Do I stay in an acceptable-yet-fairly-mediocre relationship, or break out of this rut and try for something greater and more passionate?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: Been with GF of 2 and a half years, not sure how to end it because want to travel the world alone.\nPOST: The guilt of planning this is heartbreaking. I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 and a half years now, things moved pretty fast. I basically moved in with her parents about 5 months in, lived there for a year. Now she lives with mine. We're both 23, I've pretty much decided I don't think this will last, as we're too different in so many ways. It's hard to explain, she's perfect, but just not for me. If I project what the situation will be like in 10 years time I don't see it being how it should. One of the main reasons is that I want to travel, she would come with me but isn't too bothered, like thats all I've wanted to do for the last year. Similarly she would settle down and get a deposit on a place now I'm sure aswell. Selfishly, I'm sure I want to go travelling solo. This could be the biggest mistake ever. But it's more aventure to discover myself, meet new people, and not set  any limits really. I feel if I didn't I'd just end up resenting her for it. And I'd hate that. Please don't misunderstand me and think I'm just a selfish self-centered arsehole as I'm really not, I just want to experience what it's like to be free. But then the same time I'm a hioppocrit for still being with her? I've spoken to my counceller about this, and it's like she's my security blanket (my gf I mean). During a lot of family grief, arguing and my auntie being terminally ill now she's the only person I can talk to and will listen. I can talk to her about almost everything, except this. I really need to go travelling, I've saved up all the money nearly, just a few more months. If I get my share of our savings I'll have enough. There's also the issue of she lives with my parents, and I'm not sure her parents will allow her to go back home? Maybe her dad will let her stay but I'm not even sure. I've dug this hole I know but now I've no idea what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

I still kind of want to be with her, but if she doesnt want to its not the end of the world to me. I feel like asking her for us to be a thing again would be a little weird because our school year still hasn't started yet and that was one of the main reasons we decided to not be together.\n\nIm asking for advice on how to bring this up to her, or to even bring it up at all.

I thought it was my sister knocking like a moron, so I yelled, \"CALM THE HELL DOWN, DAWG! I'M COMING, MAN!\" (Or something along those lines.) Then, I hear, \"sorry, it's the super.\" Embarrassed, I open the door, and apologize profusely, explaining that I thought it was my sister, who always knocks like that. He also apologized for knocking a lot, and told me he was just here to test the smoke detectors. I think he was surprised, because we always say hello to each other, and I'm a pretty nice guy, so it may have been surprising to him to hear me yell like that.

Virtually every job in this field in my area requires a clean DMV record because you're expected to be driving either out to clients in the community or to transport clients. I've actually avoided applying to a few jobs that specified they won't consider you if you have a single point on your record. I don't know if that's the standard or not, so I don't know if that applies to this agency. I'm in California.\n\nI had that point on my record when I applied to my current job (same field), and I don't remember how I got past that.

I am sure that X likes me since she had shown signs of interests these past few months and she also found out that I like her through other coworkers. I know some people would say \"don't shit where you eat\" but it's not like I'm going to work there forever, right? \n\nEver since I started to develop stronger feelings for X I became even more shy and quiet towards her (X even noticed this behavior and called me out on it through text saying that I've been ignoring her). So far I haven't spoken to X for about 2 weeks now and all this time I've been trying to gather my energy to tell her that I really like her and would like to know her more and ask her out from there.\nTL;DR:"}

I also wanted to say to job seekers: Don't give up. Keep looking and you will eventually get there!\n\nThis is what I've gone through.\n\nI've been unemployed for about 1.5 years. I finished university in 2012 with a Masters in Education and began looking for work immediately. I was looking for work as a high school teacher, as I was qualified to teach numerous subjects. I got a couple of bites after sending out my resume to about 50-75 schools, a couple of casual teaching days here and there, but not enough to live on. As time went on, less and less schools called, and I was running out of schools to apply to within a reasonable distance from my home. \n\nAbout 6-7 months in, I began to lose hope. With only receiving about 1-2 days of work a month, I was becoming more and more depressed. At this time, there are about 40,000 casual teachers on the 'national waitlist' (Australia) and I had lost all hope of ever finding a stable job in the education sector. I began loosening up my preferences and applying for jobs I didn't really want, and even then, with no success because of lack of experience. \n\nFast forward to about 1 month ago. I had been communicating with an employment agency for about a year and asked them to forward/recommend me onto anything they think I'd be suitable for. They told me that there was a job available if I wanted to attend the interview. They gave me basically no information, they just set it up and said this: \"Its a coordinator/supervisor role at a FDC company\". I agreed (because I had nothing to lose at this stage) and attended the interview. Well, apparently I impressed them because they called me the next day and asked if I could start on Monday.\n\nFinally! A full-time job! With security, benefits and a regular income that will increase over time. I'm currently sitting at my work desk (in my lunch break) and I'm so greatful for this job. Its in the field of education, I have my own office, air con, computer and I work great hours.\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend (16) and I (17) have been dating for about 6 months, and every time she hangs out with a group of her friends that are heavy into using drugs/drinking I find myself getting incredibly anxious. I like to think that I'm a calm, rational person, but for whatever reason I can't put my finger on exactly why I get so anxious. We've talked about substance use before and neither of us want to do anything other than occasionally smoke weed and drink, and I have full trust in her. Yet for some reason whenever I hear that she's going out and partying with her friends and she's going to get high I get all panicked and I can't calm down. I haven't talked to her about this because I don't want to bring it up as an issue when I feel like I'm being crazy for feeling this way.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm 23, I'm not looking to get married or have babies or any of that right now.'\n\nSo I'm just stunned because I thought we had gotten over his iffy-ness about being in a relationship. He goes through these periods where he feels like he's being a terrible boyfriend because of standards he sets for himself that are too high.\n\nHis major concern was that he doesn't 'feel as intensely about [me] as [I] feel about [him]'.\n\nIt basically came down to him saying he thinks he should be stupid crazy for me and have this hollywood sappy romance where he pines for my presence and company. \n\nI feel really hurt and confused and it's all just kind of catching up to me now. I talked to him about it and he's nervous about graduating college and living on his own and lots of other things that are stressing him out.\n\nHe's also my best friend and I feel that if he's going to dump me I need total separation and that we probably can't be friends for a while if ever.\n\nHe's also never dated any one else before and says that he's scared that he is going to meet someone he likes more than me, leave me for them, and hurt me. \n\nI told him that kind of makes him an asshole for abstractly thinking about how much better he could do than me. \n\nWe're still dating but I feel like I need to dump him out of self respect for myself.\n\nI know we need to sit down about my feelings but I really just want him to apologize for being so insensitive and that he needs to start thinking about his words if he wants me to be in his life.\n\nIs it even worth it after what I've written?

I'm working minimum wage and studying for my GED, he's in community college. \n\nHe's unsure of what to make his career, so his family has been pressuring him to join the military, which my own family agrees with. This month, his closest friend (20m), who's in the Navy, married his girlfriend (21f) after just two years together. We agreed it was really unprepared of them to do that (they never lived together or agreed on kids) so we never planned on getting married anytime soon. \n\nNow my boyfriend is considering joining as well, and while I support his decisions, I'm scared about being separate for so long. My mother thinks this stems from a lack of \"true\" love, saying if our relationship was truly strong it would survive such long distance. I'm not saying it would be a deal breaker, I'm just aware of how hard the military lifestyle is and I'm just not sure how or if I'd cope with the time apart.

We have a ton of fun, he's a great guy, but we both have issues with communication. We've been working hard at it and were doing better. \n\nThis is a bombshell I wasn't expecting. During the length of our relationship, I've been working full time (sometimes more) while he goes to school full time, and works a tiny bit. (brings home maybe 120$ every two weeks) He is close to graduating with 2 degrees. I am looking forward to continuing our livea together as fully functional adults. (not yet a family, we agree were too young). \n\nThis is where my trouble is. He's supposed to graduate in May, but he's doing everything he can to push it back. He has to retake his GRE, but he keeps putting it off. That's now messed up him applying for and going to graduate school next semester. \n\nOn top of this, he hasn't applied for graduation, and is now thinking about dropping a class and retaking it in the fall. One class. He has plenty of free time, does all of his homework at day and just lays around at night. Is he really having that much trouble with one class? \n\nNow my problem is, I really don't know how to approach him stating that this upsets me. I always come off laying it on too thick, making it seem like it's all his fault and that's why we argue. I don't mean to do that. I want to express to him that setting all of this back hurts my feelings. I've been supporting us for awhile, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck.

Mid-December, after a painful day at work, I went to the emergency room when I realized my left testicle was about 3 times bigger than normal. The next day my oncologist called me and basically said that he and his colleagues were 99% sure that it was cancer, and two days later I had a [radical orchiectomy] performed, removing my testicle. After the biopsy, we found out I specifically had classical [seminoma] (possibly NSFW). More blood work and CT scans later revealed I have two lymph nodes in my lower abdomen that are still affected. After meeting the hospital's specialists, my family and I decided chemotherapy will be the most effective way of dealing with the disease. That pretty much sums up the past month.\n\nMy chemotherapists gave me this huge rundown of the potential side effects. It was all pretty overwhelming at first, but then I figured that that they are basically obligated to list off **everything** that could happen. Like I said, I haven't really thought about it until now...less than 10 hours before my treatments begin. I'm just incredibly nervous, so I wanted to ask those who have gone through chemotherapy what their experiences were like. How did you keep your spirits up and pass the time during the infusions? How long did it take after your last cycle to feel fully recovered? I'm so fortunate enough to have wonderful support from my fianc\u00e9 and family, but it still seems so daunting. Any advice on what to expect would be a tremendous help to me. Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

She's french and goes to France every summer to stay at her aunt's houses. \n\nNow to the part i'm posting for, my girlfriend wanted me to come with her to France this year, I wanted to but ended up unable to as there were problems applying for my passport so I stayed home.

I normally wouldn't think anything of it but she drank a good bit, hung out with a lot of people including a bunch of guys our age and then last night she ended up sharing a sleeping bag with a guy related to her aunt's boyfriend. She told me this over the phone as a kind of summary of her time this afternoon.\n\nI don't know if it's normal but I feel really jealous. I trust her but this nagging feeling of jealousy overwhelmed me and I want to deal with this and not have it affect the relationship in any way.

She's told me how he was the worst boyfriend ever and she just got attached to him and wishes she broke up with him sooner. She also told me that they only had sex a handful of times, and we've done a lot of things that were firsts for both of us because they didn't do them.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: First breakup in years, how to handle it?\nPOST: I just broke up with my boyfriend of six months yesterday and I am having a really rough time. I am 21 years old and this was my first serious relationship in over 2 years. \n\n   My ex is a really great guy. He treated me really well; he was never afraid to show his affection and would do anything for me. We really loved each other. However, he has been cheated on in virtually every serious relationship that he has been in prior to me.  This led to him being extremely insecure and jealous. I caught him snooping in my phone and reading my text messages more than once. He would always ask me about guy friends or little incidents that he thought were indications of me cheating. It got to the point that I felt that I was constantly being interrogated and I grew really tired of having to defend myself and explain my every move.  As time went on, things only got worse as he became more and more sure that I was cheating on him. \n\n   The other day he began questioning me about someone that he thought I was cheating on him with, and I was so tired of it that I let him walk out my door and didn't follow him. I broke up with him yesterday. It was mutual, I think that the whole song and dance was emotionally exhausting for the both of us. Still, to him we broke up because of my infidelity, and to me we broke up because I could no longer bear his controlling and jealous ways. I never once was unfaithful to him, but he made me feel like I was. \n\n   I have spent the past couple of days crying my eyes out and unable to stop thinking about everything. I feel guilty, like it was all my fault, but I know that I really was finally standing up for myself. Other than the jealousy, he was a wonderful guy. I miss him so much. It has been so long since I have had to do this that I kind of forgot how to handle a breakup. Any tips to help me move on? \n\n   In any case, thank you for reading my rant. It helped a little to tell my story, even if no one reads it.\nTL;DR:"}

I am outgoing and she prefers to stay at home more. While I do enjoy a night on the Netflix, I feel like I want to be free to go out and hang out with friends or just operate on my own schedule. We have spent a lot of time working through these issues together, but it still feels unresolved.\n\nFurthermore, she is interested in kids in 5 years time, while I am not for perhaps 10 years. My girlfriend needs much more stability in her life, whilst I want to get the most adventure out of my life as I can.\n\nI feel hugely conflicted, our relationship nearly broke up about 6-7 months ago but we have worked through a lot of it. On paper it sounds like  I should be happy, but I just don't feel excited or interested in the relationship like I used to.

We got drunk, kissed and that was that. After a few weeks she added me on social media and ever since we've had a (sometimes not so) amazing relationship. \n\nI am originally from Hungary, but we now live in Germany. Her family has been amazing (asking me along on ski trips, always inviting me to dinners/birthdays and even giving me presents on my bday). My family however has been acting totally rude and incredibly unfriendly towards this amazing girl (who manages to put up with it for almost 5 years now). They never ask her to come to birthdays or other things, let alone ask her along on a holiday. \n\nShe hasn't seen my parents in a few years now, whereas I see hers every now and then. Her parents asked me a few times (years ago, mind you) if they could meet my parents but I was always a little shy about it and eventually told my gf that my parents weren't planning on meeting her parents. \n\nI once opened this up for discussion with my mom (dad acts very distant and doesn't want to discuss it) and she told me this whole situation is caused because she wasn't very polite when she first came to our house (we both live on our own now). In reality, this is because she is extremely shy. \n\nFurthermore they dont approve of her because she isnt Hungarian (this is no secret, my whole family -including uncles, aunts, grandma's- don't take her seriously, even though we've been dating for almost 5 years). \n\nSo what i've been doing now is try to be friendly to both parties. Obviously I see my gf more but I can't just shut out my parents. So when my parents invite me to have dinner somewhere with my brother, I agree and I don't take her with me (they wont have her come along). \n\nAnyway, long text, I hope this doesn't get buried and you guys can provide me with some advice as to how to handle this situation.\n\nThanks\nTL;DR:"}

So any time I would look up something I want to make, it requires things I don't have so the recipe is almost unusable anyway (I can still use some of the ideas, but still). Further supplementing my reluctance to use recipes is my regular viewing of food network competition shows, mostly Chopped, which rely largely on improvising with what you're given (albeit they have thousands of pantry items that give chefs a hell of a lot of options).\n\nSo basically, I just improvise almost every time I cook. I'll buy stuff like boneless chicken breasts and various fish fillets and just do...whatever with them using the limited ingredients I have. It's not like the end products are terrible (in fact, the most complete meal I've ever made in terms of taste and presentation, the latter of which I usually suck horribly at, was based on nothing but instinct, guesses on how tastes and textures would combine despite having never done anything like it before), but I'm concerned there's a lot of technique that I'm missing out on and I might be slowing my learning process with the way I do things. Plus, I'm not building up a mental recipe bank like my parents both seem to have because I don't really use any. So what I'm asking is A) see title question and B) what really is the best way to improve my skills as a chef moving forward? I love cooking and only want to better my skills\nTL;DR:"}

Made me sick when I first saw it pop up while we were watching a show together. She became extremely flustered and uncomfortable, quickly turned off skype and made some awkward excuses that were really detailed but sounded fishy. Won't be the first time something like this has happened. We're getting married soon - suddenly having a hard time knowing if that's a good idea... I'd thought this issue was over a year ago. Confronted her after a very awkward period of watching a comedy and only chuckling slightly now and then... she blushed, didn't make eye contact, seemed unsure of her story and was really vague.

Well what do you know, a tearful goodbye turned into us kissing. We have always been really close so this wasn't actually that unexpected. After a lot of (me) crying, I told him I really liked him and he likes me too, but we decided not to be in a relationship because of West Point. I'm going to the University of Pittsburgh in August, so that's how far away we'll be from each other.  \n    \nNow that Nick's gone, I'm just incredibly sad. We talked to each other on the phone up until the very last moment, and now I have absolutely zero contact with him until basic training is over (end of August). We can write letters to each other, and I've written him a few since last Monday, but he hasn't responded. I'm not upset, because obviously he has lots of stuff to do. I never thought I'd want to be in a relationship going into college, but now I can't imagine having what I have with him with anyone else. Should I work on moving on?

In fact, she eats better than the vast majority of people that I know. However, despite this she still struggles to keep her weight down. She exercises diligantly 4+ times a week (gym, hiking together, etc.) and to make things easier for herself, she uses the WeightWatchers point system. She also follows a number of weight-loss blogs religiously (such as thinspiration), and is always looking for new healthy meals to make. However, she has a routine of doing very well for most of a week, loses a couple pounds, but then then having 1 or 2 days (typically the weekend) where she \"cheats\" and puts all (or more) of the weight back on. \n\nTo try and help support her, we challenge each other to eat as best as we can, we have started doing weekly hikes, and I have started going back to the gym. (However, I am naturally very skinny and actually trying to gain weight/muscle). \n\nFor 8 months she moved out on her own, which allowed us to cook all our own food and only buy healthy foods. She was in that bad cycle for much of her time out, but in the last 3 months we really made an effort and she ended up losing 15lbs. Unfortunately, she had to move back home where now her parents cook most of the meals (we cook dinner about 2 times a week), and she has put all of the weight back on. \n\nBasically, I want to know what else I can do to help her and to support her. Also, if you have any tips for her I would very much appreciate it.\nTL;DR:"}

We rarely fight and we solve our problems right away. We respect each other and never do anything to harm each other. Buuuut... we didn't have that 'OMG I CAN'T SLEEP NOR EAT JUST THINKING ABOUT HER/HIM OMG HE LIKED MY PICTURE!!!' phase, but we did have a very loving honeymoon phase. Therefore, we fell in love silently and truly deeply. I literally cannot imagine my life without my boyfriend.

I feel physically fine now, we're totally okay, but some days are hard. Even though I have improved, I can barely function like this and I'm sick and tired. I love him and I cannot live without him, at least I don't know how to live if we break up. He's **everything** I want in a man, too. Has anyone else gone through this, or at least something similar?

The problem is, I'm not sure that I want her to come back. I don't really miss her all that much.\n\nI'm really confused about how I feel, I don't know if I want out of the relationship because I'm no longer in love with her, or because she's away and I'm getting distracted by all the pretty girls who are still around, or if the kinda apathy towards our relationship is normal after so long.\n\nI have started to develop a little bit too much of a crush on one of the waitresses at the local bar, it'll never go anywhere, but I think that might have a lot to do with how I'm feeling as well.\n\nThe problem is, my girlfriend is a warm and loving person, and when I think about leaving her, I know it would crush her... and the thought of hurting her kills me!\n\nShould I keep quiet and try to make things work long distance, work out how I feel when she moves back next summer, or is that just the coward talking, should I tell her everything I'm thinking?\nTL;DR:"}

Due to how accommodating our city's culture is of Latinos, my parents managed to get by without ever learning English. That's not to say that my father hasn't *tried*, but at his age, learning a new language just might not happen.\n\nFiance [M24] and his family, on the flip side, are as American as they come. Everyone speaks English only.\n\nOur wedding is coming up. Every friend and acquaintance Fiance and I have, all of our co workers and important connections, all speak English. At first glance, it makes sense to have all the toasts and vows and services in English.\n\nProblem is, my dad will be the only one left in the cold, unable to understand a word. His speech at the rehearsal dinner will not be understood by most guests. I, as the bride, will obviously be too busy on wedding day to do my usual duty of liaison/translator, which I've done every time so far when our families get together.\n\nWe know of two other bilingual guests who could help out -- my dad's girlfriend and my fiance's best friend.

That's a cue I wanna make sure he doesn't miss.\n\nDo you guys have any suggestions for accommodating his language needs? Maybe print a special version of the program in Spanish, with the vows translated, for him to read along? Anything else I could do to bridge the gap, without disrupting the flow of the day?\nTL;DR:"}

The bag I wanted goes for $170 as it has more space and a far better aesthetic value. You can find that [here] My friend had shipped it to me without my knowledge but yesterday overheard me say the exact bag I wanted. I don't know if I should tell my friend that I don't like it. \n\nMy friend did message me once they got the delivery confirmation and said \"Im pretty sure it's not the one you want. That's why I said you can return it if you want. There should be a return label in there. They didn't have the leather straps for that bag, which I know you wanted more... Sorry.\" \n\nCan anyone offer me what I could/should do? I really don't want to hurt my friend's feelings but I also don't want their money to go to waste.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Boyfriend's landlady waited until he and his roommates had been living here for seven months before she charged them utilities. Is this legal?\nPOST: So basically, my boyfriend and his roommates having been living in this apartment for around seven months give or take. And the landlady told them when they moved in that she would be charging them for utilities. She never sent them any utilities bills or gave any word of them owing her money for utilities. Only ever asked for the rent every month. So right around the time I move in, the landlady has told them that she's going to make a new lease with me on it, and also she's adding up the amount they each owe her for utilities for the last seven months.\n\nMy boyfriend and his roommates figure, whatever, that's a weird way to do things, but no big deal. Tonight, my boyfriend received an email explaining exactly how much money they owe her each. We crunched the numbers and it was over $300.\n\nNow my boyfriend doesn't have this kind of money off hand and neither do I. Neither do the other roommates. And he's worried that his landlady is going to want the money all at once, which he obviously just can't do. I told him to tell her that he doesn't have that money and he'll have to pay her in installments (like he should have been doing in the first place). Should she request that he pay it all at once, is it legal for her to do so?\nTL;DR:"}

We weren't just walking randomly, but as a class to the library to get our textbooks. I opened the door for her, carried her books back, ect. She ended up having to drop the class because she had already taken it, she had told me when we were walking that she already intended to do so, and tought it was silly for her to get a book.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (21m) have my first crush and I'm clueless about a girl(20f).\nPOST: I'll explain a bit of the background. I'm 21 and I've spent the last 3 years in college. With regard to women, I had a bad relationship from 15 to 19. Afterward I spent 6 months going through casual encounters and the last 6 months looking for women to date. That didn't go well. What I learned from these women, is that what I want is appreciation and then loyalty. Recently, I met a girl who seems appreciative and not just looking for attention. I spent a lot of time trying to convince myself I didn't like this girl, but I still had feelings for her. I think this girl is first crush since I never had trouble forgetting about a girl. She told me broke up with her boyfriend 2 weeks ago. So I began to make my move.\n\nI didn't ask her out on a date since I wasn't sure how she felt. Instead I got her to help me take pictures at an art gallery. The conversation was enjoyable as usual. Things took a wrong turn when I told her that I got her a surprise. She said it was creepy. I had gotten her a bottle of this beer she liked and was hard to find. She then asked me about a weird part of my childhood. I told there was a time when I sold drugs and got shot. She knows me as a hardworking A student and mathematician to be who loves his family and friends, so it was a shock to her. She called me a liar. I got a hug when she said bye so I think I got friend zoned.\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do. I don't think I have ever believed a girl's appreciation, but I've never been called a creepy liar. I felt cheap and angry more than anything else. The crush is gone, but I want to know what happened. Am I being creepy or is she being weird? I also want to know why some girls have issues with being genuine. To me it's a major turn off.\n\nI kind of wish I spent more time dating than working. Any thoughts would be great.\nTL;DR:"}

He says he wants to give me something as good as he can when he gets better and that's why he wants to wait for a relationship, and that not being in a relationship means Hea not dragging me down and would let me leave if I want.

I started at my current high school after being kicked out of my last school, details irrelevant.(if you are genuinely curious for reasons pertaining to this question then PM me and I will elaborate)  I went to class, made friends etc.  But I had no idea who I was going to ask to senior prom.  Until I learned a girl in my class had yet to be asked, I was dumbfounded by this because I found her extremely attractive.  So I asked her and she said yes.  We became \"prom date friends\" and would hookup when we were together.  I found myself liking her.  (more backstory) its difficult for me to get close to girls because I have been extremely hurt in the past and I find it best to just close myself off) Prom went smoothly, pretty generic actually we stayed together through the post prom party my high school puts on to keep us from drinking.  After prom we continued to talk and hookup.  The next week we went to a dave matthews band concert and I took care of her when she \"died\" I got her water, held her hair when she vomited and even kissed her.  But after the concert she became distant until she asked if she could come over to my house.  Upon opening the door she immediately asked if \"we could talk\" at this point I began to suspect something was up, she said she thought I was amazing, good looking, all that typical bullshit someone says when they are about to break up with you.  Then she said I think we should just be friends.  I know this seems like a long and pointless explanation to a simple ending but I really need some advice.  I rarely open up to girls because I am always afraid of being hurt and all this has done is reinforce my belief that everything ends with pain and sadness.

However, he's a cool guy, and really respects all of this, probably more than anybody else I've met in a while.\n\nIt isn't like I'm going to be in any position to meet him any time soon - we live across the ocean from each other. I feel like I have some sort of feelings for him that are a little more than friends, and many people regard me as being very mature for my age. However, since I'm so young, I would plan on waiting before getting anything to happen anyway. I know that an age difference this big is usually considered to be unacceptable. There is a possibility that he feels the same way and just doesn't wish to make things complicated or to be cutting things very close to the line of what is acceptable.\n\nThere are many people within the community who make jokes about the two of us being in a relationship and other things along those lines. It does make me a little uncomfortable that it's something I would never consider making happen until I was absolutely sure of what I wanted and who I am, and this is most of the reason as to why I'm posting this here.\nTL;DR:"}

I've read and heard about Mardi Gras and all I can think about is the boob flashing, promiscuous women and hardcore drinking/partying side of it. I should also add that we have had some trust issues in the past. I caught him continuing to see a girl who he'd previously had a one night stand with, 4 months into our relationship. He tried to hide this information from me (ie. told me he was at the gym when he was really at her place). He swears he told her about me when we started dating, that he never cheated or touched her since, and that he stayed in contact with her only because he wanted to remain friends and because of her depression. It was so long ago, we've talked about it over and over, but trust has never been the same since. Reddit, should I be concerned? Is Mardi Gras really what I think it is?\nTL;DR:"}

We still talked to each other for a few days and then she suddenly stopped responding to my texts.\n\nDuring winter break she randomly messaged me on Facebook telling me that she misses me all the time and that she still loves me. She tried to call me on the phone three times in a row but I didn't answer because I was in public. Later on I asked her if she still wanted to talk and she never responded. A few days later she asked if I was still back home for break, I said yes and the conversations sort of fizzled out after that. \n\nAs far as I can tell she is still with her new boyfriend.

We need insight on how to navigate the situation.\nPOST: My mother and I have never really had a great relationship. She is emotionally and verbally abusive to us kids and it has only gotten worse since she and our father divorced over TEN YEARS ago. Both of our parents have since remarried. My sister and I are both getting married next year (sister in Spring, me in Fall) and, as terrible as it may sound, we do not want to invite our mother to our weddings. She has an alcohol problem that she refuses to acknowledge, let alone seek help for (we've tried) and we just don't want to risk her ruining what is supposed to be a happy, loving occasion. Our maternal grandmother even supports our decision 100%, but there is still this sense of guilt we have to shake and we don't know how to move forward from here. Do we tell our mother she's not invited? Do we just avoid the subject altogether and pretend it's not even happening? Our mother rarely contacts/responds to us unless it's to be nasty and dredge up old divorce drama. My sister and I have tried so hard to repair this broken relationship but it nothing seems to help. She harasses us on social media, she has harassed my ex via social media, she disowns us about every six months and goes as far as to tell people she doesn't even have any daughters. She refused to attend my college graduation simply because I invited my dad (whom she'd divorced at that point). She ruined my sister's graduation party by running her mouth and making a scene. She owns a gun and I'm honestly terrified she may become violent in a drunken stupor. Ultimately, it's just a difficult situation and we could use some insight on how to navigate it when it comes time to send out wedding invitations. Thanks for reading!\nTL;DR:"}

The last few months were causing me sadness because I felt insecure and not as loved as I did before. I had brought it up with him before, a few times, but his affection didn't really change.

First time make-out, second time sex. Him and I were never really friends and never really talked before or after it happened. We generally avoided each other after it happened. As things tend to go everyone in the group eventually found out that we did it. While a tiny bit awkward, I don't really mind.

That group still hangs out but I'm not part of it. We will all be at the wedding. I'm pretty excited that I have a boyfriend I can invite and show off. It will be fun for us to attend together and I can avoid feeling like the odd woman out with this group.

I could explain if that happens but wouldn't want him to think I was hiding anything or feel stupid for being in the dark about something other people know about. On the other hand, if I tell him, I guess I would just say that I hooked up with one of the guys but that we never dated and it wasn't a big deal. However, then I would have to point him out, or tell my bf his name, and he would likely be on the lookout for said guy during the wedding.

I didn't take a single final either.  I fully expected to fail all of my classes, but I got a surprise when I got my grades. I did fail or alnost fail most of my classes, but the one professor that I had gone to for the extension gave me a grade based solely on the work I had completed and didn't include the work I had missed.  The only thing I could come up with as to why he did it was because he knew what I was going through.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, what can I do to make my little cousin feel more loved, despite his deadbeat dad?\nPOST: Friday my 11 year old cousin, we'll call him timmy, called me because he was scared to get in the car with his father who had been drinking. After making sure he was safe (I told him to refuse to go, and to stay with our uncle until my mom could go get him) I had to tell him I was at school and too far away for him to visit. \n\nHis, father/my uncle \"Jerry\" is a 40 year old drunk that lives with his sugar momma, whom he treats terribly. He gambles all his money away and puts it back in the bar. His idea of quality time is bringing my cousin to the bar, teaching him to hustle at pool, and dumping him at my house with my family that loves him very much. There have been times where he has rang the door bell late at night just to ding dong ditch his kid with us so he could go gamble. \n\nAll of this shit hit the fan friday after I called my mom; my uncle got in a fight with my mother, his brother, and cried the whole night at my house about his problems. This was a result of my other uncle telling timmy \" I hope you don't end up like your father when he grows up. Jerry flipped shit and went after my other uncle, who promptly threw him in a head lock and told him to leave. The worst, though, was realizing that my little cousin cried the whole way to my house after witnessing his dad and uncle fight. He screamed at his father \"You never do anything with me!!! You don't spend time with me!!\"\n\nIn light of all this, I really want to treat my poor cousin to a special day. He loves baseball, but unfortunately wastes most of his sunny days in front of a video game console trying to get his father to play with him. I am away at school but will probably make a trip back just to see him. Keep in mind, I am indeed a poor college student. He's 11 and he's really good at math. Hates reading though. No surprise though, since no one ever picks up a book with him.\nTL;DR:"}

I answered honestly as I could. I do my best to appease my brother so that I don't get yelled at or shut down or have to argue with him because he scares me when he's mad and the repercussions when he gets angry are plenty (name calling, me getting in trouble by my parents etc.) and he stays angry for a long time (passive aggressiveness). He also seems to never forgive my mistakes and never forgets them, constantly bringing them up.\n\nAfter my therapist implied the relationship was unhealthy/abusive I got to thinking. Today I took an online quiz (so accurate right?) and apparently if the score was 26-60 then it was highly probable that it was toxic. Brother got a score of 40.\n\nHe's only physically hurt me 2-3 times (not badly at all whatsoever). If you want details ask but really they were probably situations in which I merited them.\n\nI do feel guilty because when I was younger I was very bossy and rude towards him, but I also feel bad because I haven't been like that in years and he seems to still resent that although he's never said it outright. He doesn't recognize when I am improving or fix something.\n\nI do love my brother and when he's happy and satisfied he is the most amazing and fun guy. I just feel I constantly have to listen to everything he says and not agree and follow his directions because I don't want the anger that comes from him. If I appease him like this, everything just flows a ton better. When we grow up I don't want him to remember me like the mean sister, I want to have fun and be close to him. \n\nIt's just easier like this.\nTL;DR:"}

After consideration over the years I've guessed that I'm bisexual but with a slant towards women. I've wrestled with the notion though that perhaps I'm just suppressing my gay interests for societal reasons. I haven't told anyone about these feelings or acted on them previously.\n\nRecently my relationship has been getting increasingly serious and there's talk of marriage. I've had this nagging concern though that I don't want to leave these feelings unexplored my whole life. What if I figure out at 50 that I'm gay? It would be bad for me sure, but worst of all I will have wrecked the life of the woman I love.\n\nNow I stew over this for months and eventually I thoroughly and honestly convince myself that it's in both of our interests for me to try meeting up with a guy and to see how it goes. I found someone on Craigslist while my girlfriend was out of town over the weekend and we hooked up (I gave him head). Ultimately, I didn't find any enjoyment out of the experience at all. It wasn't fun or exhilarating as I had imagined. I leave convinced that my interests are mostly heterosexual in nature and I'm ready to commit.\n\nWith that figured out I then snap out of it and realize I've cheated. Somehow I expected I'd be able to compartmentalize this and not think about it. Instead I feel really guilty. Should I tell her? Unfortunately if I do tell her I suspect that our relationship will either not survive or never be the same.\nTL;DR:"}

We're both juniors in high school (17 years old). So we've been together for a pretty long time. We both know know we're not ready for sex, and I don't expect that of her at all.\n\nHowever, I've gone to second and third base with her (rather immature terminology for saying I've basically gone all the way to performing oral). And of course, she enjoys it. However, she has yet to return the favor, meaning she hasn't performed oral, nor has she even really touched down there, other than a few occasions over my jeans. Now of course, I've never pressured her to do anything. And this is by no means a dealbreaker for our relationship. \n\nI've tried slowly getting her more comfortable, and she said she's curious to try things out, but she never makes any effort at all towards trying it out. Every time we make out, it's basically until she's orgasmed from whatever it is I'm doing, and then I'm left unsatisfied. \n\nAm I right to think this is kind of unfair? Or am I just being a jerk for thinking like this? \n\nLike I've said, I've never pressured her to do anything at all. And this isn't something that's going to break the relationship for me. I know we're young and there's no rush, and I do like her very much, but sometimes it just feels like I'm not getting any sexual satisfaction, and being a pubescent 17 year old, hormones definitely are acting up.\nTL;DR:"}

I have never met someone I was able to connect with on such a deep level. We had a great time talking late at night and a second outing for dinner and drinks. It felt like our connection was on a soul level. It seemed like I was able to feel his feelings and he was able to feel mine. I could not describe the intensity of these feelings, despite the relationships I've had in the past. Those moments with him felt so intense and powerful we could both intuitively feel each others thought processes and emotions. The concept of a soulmate always seemed just a fictional concept until I locked my eyes with Donald's. \n\nAfter our second outing, Donald had suggested we go out again for a meal. I had texted him and tried to set up third outing, but have not heard a response. It's been a month since then. I am not sure if perhaps he's just not interested.

Frankly, I do not want to be that girl who is nagging for another date and am used to the male initiating. \n\nHow should one proceed from this?

I've been a long time lurker on r/relationships and am finally posting as my boyfriend and I are in need of outside opinions.\n\nLong-story short, my boyfriend is apart of a Youth Programme and will be for the next 10 weeks along with 7 other teenagers around his age (6 of them being female, with only one other male teen). Due to the nature of this programme he is occasionally required to participate in group activities, and can be paired up with any one of the females.\n\nIn particular, there is one female who over the last five days has caused us more issues than we've encountered during the last five months of our relationship - we'll call her \"H\". \"H\" has outwardly flirted with my boyfriend inside of the group. She has gone out of her way to ignore my existence (my boyfriend has made it clear to the group as a whole that he is in a committed relationship with me) by purposely not mentioning my boyfriends goal of wanting to teach me how to ski. According to my boyfriend, she has also paid incredible amounts of attention to only my boyfriend, completely ignoring the (completely single) other male teen in the group. She has also grinded against my boyfriends crotch in front of other teens in the group, which my boyfriend has now realised was a set-up. \n\nIt is important to note that any one of the teenagers MAY NOT contact each other outside of the programme - meaning there is no chance of her contacting him outside of the programme and once the ten weeks are over he has no interest in contacting her either. \n\n\"H\" has done so much more than what I've mentioned, and we are pretty certain that she is maybe slightly delusional and for some reason is trying to pursue my boyfriend even though he's very committed. \n\nWe would appreciate ALL suggestions on how to deal with H as well as this situation as a couple. My boyfriend feels incredibly ill realising her intentions, and does not wish to attend this programme any longer, but is also weary about privately confronting her as she may have mental illnesses.

Then I walked her to her bus stop, we parted and both went home.\n\nThe next week was valentines day and we went to a 'gathering' at a friends house, as we both have the same social group. We all took a few shots, then my crush and me got off, went to watch a movie and cuddled. Later she was sick (from too much alcohol) so I looked after her and stayed with her overnight.\nNext week we go on another date, go to the cinema, cuddle, get off etc...\n\nWe see each other the next Monday in college, and after that I don't see her for the rest of the week and the week that follows as it was mock exams and I went away on a geography trip.\nDuring my trip she started replying less and less to the point where I'd get one reply per day. I just presumed that she's busy with revision.\nSo today in college she comes up, asks me how my trip was etc, then asks whether we can go talk outside, to which I happily agree thinking nothing of it, but unfortunately she breaks the news and tells me she only likes me as a friend but she enjoyed the dates and that she's really sorry.

Our 3 year old mastiff mix is scheduled to go in for TPLO surgery tomorrow morning. The professional advice we have been given is that because our dog is large (~110lb), TPLO is the only knee surgery they really recommend. We've done a fair bit of research and have found everything from \"We are so glad we had this surgery for our pooch!\" to, \"It's not a proven solution/they can heal without surgery/the surgeons just want to gouge you for maximum $$!\".\n\nThe extra kicker is our poor girl has bi-lateral cruciate ligament ruptures so they are suggesting we will need to do the second knee once the first is healed. The second knee is considered \"chronic\" now as our previous vet had told us over a year ago that her limp was due to hip dysplasia and had us medicating; meanwhile, it would seem it was the knee joint which was wearing down all along. The first knee ruptured more recently, likely due in part to compensating for the other. But I digress...\n\nIt's more expensive than any pet surgery either of our families have experienced and so our families are skeptical of our decision to proceed, mainly worried about the financial burden on us as well as the difficult surgical recovery time. Of course we would rather not go through it all, but this dog is part of our family and we want to give her the best possible quality of life.\nTL;DR:"}

So i finally got him to get some help about 4 days ago (a psych thats asked him to come back in a month) and then two days ago another si\u013aly fight because we just wanted to talk about being more affectionate with each other and i was emotional cos i got my period today sorry tmi but didnt know i was pmsing but he left me.

I hated living there because it was all the same people, you had to drive 30 minutes away if you needed **anything**, and I was also stuck in a custody situation where I lived at my mom's for a week, then my dad's for a week, etc.\n\nIn high school I was in band and drama club, so I had a few friends from there, including one person I would call my best friend. I never really \"hung out\" with friends unless it was some sort of school/club event. I just rarely had people over at either of my houses.\n\nAfter graduation I decided not to go to college because I loathed school and wanted no more of it. I jumped on a dating site and met a guy from a city an hour's drive away. He drove up to meet me a couple times, and we've been together ever since.\n\nI graduated in 2012. I am now living with my boyfriend and his family. I have a job and I'm going to community college here. The only friend I talk to occasionally is the best friend from high school.

Said scumbag friend decides now's a perfect time to start talking and flirting to your girlfriend all the time, text her more than she texts you, hang out with her more than she does with you, and the like. You end up breaking up with said girlfriend, and this friend starts hanging out with her even more, and even stays in her dorm room with her for long periods of time, even though that was never even offered to the boyfriend of two years.\n\nReddit, how the fuck do I deal with this? \n\nDo I kick his ass? That's a rhetorical question, no actual intent for violence. I sure feel like it though,\nTL;DR:"}

Am I overreacting?\nPOST: My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been together for a year. This weekend, we went on a ski trip with some friends. We knew about 5 of the 20 people in our group so we made a few friends along the way. The last night we were there, I got sick and spent most of the night alone in our hotel room. I tried getting him to stay in the room with me but he wanted to drink with his friends, so I gave him my blessing to go hang out and come back when he's done drinking \n\nCut to 4am, my boyfriend finally gets back to the hotel room and he is belligerent drunk. I tell him how sick I am and he leaves the room to see if anyone has medicine for me. About 20 minutes pass and he still isn't back, so I peek my head out the door to see what's going on.\n\nI see him talking to a girl and she is clearly trying to put the moves on him. From what I could gather from the situation, she as trying to tell him to come to her room with her. My boyfriend was clearly drunk, but he looked like he was having trouble making a decision. She kept saying \"her or me?\" And my bf kept saying he can't bc he's a good person, but he seemed as if it was a VERY difficult decision to make. He clearly wanted to go with her but his conscience was keeping him from going. I walked out of the room and said something to them and the girl ran away. \n\nMy boyfriend insists that he did nothing wrong because he didn't do anything, but I can't stop thinking about how torn he seemed about his decision.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/weddingplanning\nTITLE: In defense of DB- especially on a limited budget.\nPOST: DB has a really bad reputation, sometimes for good reasons, but here's my experience. The first thing I liked about DB is that they will exchange unaltered dresses for different sizes. So supposed you buy a dress 9 months out, then 3 months later have dropped a size or two- they'll switch the sizes out for you. As a lady whose weight fluctuates, this was a big selling point!!!\n\nAnyway, I bought a gorgeous dress at DB. It was a flow-y chiffon ballgown with an empire waist. It was perfect for my ceremony in a grove of cedar trees! 2 months out, I took it to an independent seamstress to shorten it and customize a bit. I certainly didn't trust DB when it came to alterations. There are HORROR stories about alterations.  I also wanted more individual attention.\n\nTurns out the DB dress I bought for 700 looked VERY similar to a dress that the seamstress had been working on that was $7,000. and mine was a lighter, more comfortable fabric. She also thought mine was aesthetically more beautiful. The seamstress showed me the 7,000 dollar dress and I was completely stunned by the similarities. She also told me that she had been working on a bunch of DB dresses lately and was changing her tune about them. \n\nShe DID however, help make the dresses a little better and more unique. (and gave me a new garment bag without the DB logo). After my first fitting she also helped me realize that the boustier and petticoat that DB wanted me to buy made me look WORSE in the dress. \n\nAt the end of the day, I'm really happy with my purchase and I was happy that I had an open mind about making the dress my own and not falling into buying unnecessary accessories. So don't immediately discard DB if you are on a budget.\nTL;DR:"}

So, background, I'm about 7 months out of a ~3 year off/on relationship (which ended finally on my terms and which I was happy to be out of) and have been using Tinder like nobody's business for about 6 of those months. Initially it was a pretty humorous social experiment for me, then unexpectedly had a fantastic summer romance out of it (ended because dude was moving across the country). That aside, pretty much just dated all over the place but recently found that perhaps I do want something more than casual dating at this point. Basically I want something stable, consistent, and comfortable.\n\nEnter dude. It's finals week, which was pretty light for both of us, and we hung out daily until he left for winter break. Things are good, but he has some weird idea that I'm out of his league, I do my best to squash that idea. He spends most of break text/sexting me, several times mentioning looking forward to spending a lot of time with me in the upcoming semester...then sorta starts to disappear. Replies get shorter before pretty much stopping altogether until he gets back. Wherein, basically, he tells me he's back and then stops replying for a few days. I say I sense there's a hint I should be taking, he finally says \"not at all!\" and explains what he's been busy with. Then the radio silence resumes, and I'm fed up, so I basically say I'm not sure what to do with his mixed signals. We hang out, it all seems well and good, he texts me quite a bit the next day and then...more radio silence. \n\nI'm aware this is rather petty. But there was a feeling that I'd hit it off pretty well with this guy, he seemed perhaps even too into me given the time elapsed, and then he disappears. I had started to see other people, mainly because I was going to cut my losses if he'd begun to lose interest. So I have other options. But he is my favorite option.\nTL;DR:"}

I feel like I should explain a few more things.\nPOST: Link to first post: \n\nLast night we were watching a movie, when his brother, A, decided to also watch a movie. He always plays it way too loud and the bass shakes the entire house. We've asked him to turn it down millions of times. I have misophonia so I get irrational and furious to those kinds of triggers. Anyway, so instead of asking to turn it down and getting ignored, I decided to slam doors and cupboards and things to annoy A and some random girl he was with. It was immature, I know. But my boyfriend got extremely upset with me and his brothers and it kind of got out of hand.\n\nWe talked about breaking up because he can't handle the stress of taking care of his parents house, taking care of his brothers, their animals, and also worrying about me. He's always worried that I'm angry at him. He's always asking what's wrong. Sometimes I get so annoyed by it that I end up ignoring him, which drives him crazy. I almost always tell him the truth about how I'm feeling the first time he asks. But he almost never believes me. \n\nSo we ended up not breaking up. We didn't really fix much of anything. The only thing that really happened was that he asked me to try to take control of my misophonia. He says he's sick of being the middle man, always asking his brothers to be quiet or turn it down. So I agreed to put in headphones or ask them myself. Whatever. It's not like I haven't tried that before. \n\nI still want to break up. He doesn't because he realizes that if I left, he wouldn't have the money to live in his parents house or buy a car or go to school without having to work. I want to leave, but I don't want to pretty much ruin his life. I don't know how to tell him how I really feel. I don't know how to make him realize I'm unhappy. I've told him a million times, but it just doesn't stick. Sorry, I just need more advice.\nTL;DR:"}

Got along amazingly, bonded quickly and became each other's trusted confidants. Last summer I flew out to visit and stayed at his apartment. During this time he admitted to being bi-curious and asked if I was open to experimenting. I declined but it happened anyway (now 4 months ago). \n\nAfterwards he said it helped strengthen his identity but I didnt push the matter to know what that meant exactly. Since then we are still as close as ever but back to everyday bros. He has hooked up with a girl in that time as well.\n\nProblem is, I cant stop thinking about him and the night we hooked up. I want to discuss it with him even though it could make things weird for awhile. I want to explain how I feel but I will respect him, his choices, his space etc and dispel any notion of us being more than friends. I wrote out a letter with my sincerest thoughts and ordered it just the way I imagine the conversation going. If i talk to him about it I will most likely become flustered and forget some things or start talking in circles.\n\nBut, if you were going to get a bomb like this dropped on you, would you rather get a note with everything laid out and some time to think?

I've been dating a girl for about 3 years now, and things had a rocky start, and sparing out a lot of the details we both got rid of all our past partners entirely. Neither one of us cheated on each other (to my knowledge) during that time, and we ended up being stronger because of that.\n\nThere was always one guy who was around, she was engaged to him a year before we met and they had been highschool sweethearts before that. They broke up during her crazy college days and he claimed he hated her but is still close with her younger sister and family (they had been dating for almost 6 years at that point). \n\nSo fast forward to modern day, I go away for the weekend with friends and I lose my phone. I relayed a message to her via a friend but she never called me on my friends phone like I asked her to so I could talk to her. She was pissed off about me leaving before the trip and during, so I assumed it was just that she was mad at me. \n\nI come home today and she is still mad at me, but it turns out her and some friends were hanging out and her ex was there too. Now there are posts on Facebook from her  sisters, her mom, and a song about getting back with an old love on Facebook. I really thought things would work out between us, but I just don't know how to interpret this.

I later deleted them (his camera, not mine) because I felt uncomfortable with the photos. This was while I was visiting for the weekend.\n\nI travel back home, and text to see if he wants to skype.

I felt ok with him having nude pictures of me before, but now the trust is gone and I'm not ok with it. The fact that I don't trust him anymore, to me, means I should break up with him. \n\nFinal point: one day in that weekend, I felt very tired. I said I didn't want to go out that night: he really wanted me to. So he told me, while I was resting, \"it's fine, i'll go out, you rest.\" I asked him twice if he was ok with me staying in, and he said \"yes\" both times.\n\nHe came home angry with me, and stayed angry until about midday the next day. He says I should have known he wanted me to go out with him, and shouldn't have stayed home. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is I would really like to end this by email tonight. Do I have a moral obligation to do this the most personal way possible by long distance: skype?

She has a conservative family and visiting at her parents house was really awkward for her.  Soon after her father passed my niece was diagnosed with terminal cancer with only months to live.  As my niece is deteriorating badly, she tells me she slept with someone else because we don't communicate enough.  I was (am) so mad at her for this. It's one thing to break it off but to drop that on me when my niece is dying is just infuriating.  It was a time I could have really used some emotional support.\n\nI stopped responding to her emails and calls.  She reached out to me a few times after my niece passed and I ignored her.  Almost 2 years past she sent me a long email mostly in the tone of lets forget that ever happened and I replied with a terse \"I don't want you in my life\" type response.  I get really mad at her every time I think of this whole mess and yet I also find myself thinking about her, the whole life we had, and how hard it is to start over.  I've dated others since but admittedly am not seeing anyone at the moment.\n\nOn one hand I feel I need to unburden myself with this hatred I have for her and should just forgive her.  On the other had, I can't help but think she abandoned me at a time when I was really unraveling watching a 9 year old succumb to cancer and any sort of forgiveness would be like betraying the love I have for my niece.

We were talking for a month before we started seeing each other. He was initially very flirty with me (via text, we met online before meeting in person), and it was great! Ever since we started dating, if I try to flirt with him, he either ignores it or laughs it off. I finally asked him if there was something wrong and he said, \"I'm sorry it is nothing personal I promise. I am normally not like this and I am surprised at how unflirty I have been, I guess the distance is making me keep my guard up\". When we are together (in-person) there are no issues, we are great together. It's just when we are texting and such, which is a big part of the LDR.\n\nI am going home next weekend and will be seeing him. I want to talk to him face to face about this and hopefully help him put his guard down a bit. How should I start the conversation, what should I ask, and when would the best time to do so be (i.e. when I first see him, or maybe later in the night when we are more relaxed)?  He has never told me about his past, but he has said he has had \"bad luck\" with distance in the past... is it appropriate for me to ask what he means by this?\nTL;DR:"}

She intends to stay in the city in which we live and pursue her career here. She needs to stay close to her parents and family. She is an only child, and this location is fairly non-negotiable for her, though she is open to short-term travel. \n\nMy interests, experiences, degree, and passions are leading me toward a career that involves travel and living in other states and likely another country on the other side of the world for at least a year, possibly many more. If I choose this option, it will likely mean the end of our relationship, and she isn't willing to wait around trying to build a marriage and eventually family with a man who hasn't committed to sticking around and allowing her to focus on her career as well. \n\nEssentially it looks like I'm going to have to choose between exploring the world and myself while pursuing a more lucrative and interesting career, and staying here with her and doing something else with my degree that allows me to stay in the state. I'm afraid that I'll resent her forever if I choose the latter, but that I'll regret giving her up forever if I choose the former. A compromise might be possible, but I'm not sure. \n\nI know that nobody except I can make this decision, but I'm looking for advice in how to go about weighing options and trying to reach a decision. Maybe someone can speak from personal experience. Thanks. \n\nThrowaway account.\nTL;DR:"}

Need Advice.\nPOST: My mother and stepdad have been together for about 7 years. During my actual parent's relationship, my mum and stepdad were sleeping together for 17 years behind my dad's back. Eventually my family broke apart, and then my mother and stepdad got together. My mother is not the easiest person to live with, she has OCD and is very set in her own opinions, and the stepdad is definitely going through the classic mid life crisis at the moment, wanting freedom and to be young again.\n\nAnyway, fast forward 7 years, my stepdad has been contracted working overseas in Saudi Arabia now for about 6 months, every 8 weeks he comes back here to Australia for 12 days and then goes back to work. It's been a rocky few months with them, they had the make or break talk about 6 weeks ago, with my mother declaring everything she was unhappy with, and it seemed that stepdad just folded to all of her demands. One of which is planning on selling their house and building a new one.\n\nRecently, while on facebook, I noticed a post from my stepdad to a lady who lives in Bahrain, which is where he goes on the weekends from work. It was obviously meant to be a private message, but some old people are still learning about that. Well, this message consisted of things like \"I've enjoyed spending time with you while I'm here, and I'd like to see you again.\" and it finished with \"I miss you.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what I read, and silly me didn't take a screenshot. An hour later he noticed what he did and it was removed off facebook.\n\nWith my stepdads history of cheating in every single relationship he has had, and the fact that my mum and him have not been very stable the last few months, I'm thinking he is cheating on her. And I do not know what to do.\n\nShould I tell my mum? Confront my stepdad even though I have no evidence?\nTL;DR:"}

Yes, guys have seen my breasts before, and yes, they did notice the size difference and usually comment. I just feel really uncomfortable/inhibited with them being so different, in and out of clothes. They have been this way since I was 13 and I am now done developing according to my family doc and gyno.\nI am getting implants over winter break with an excellent surgeon. (I am in college). I'm requesting a very natural look--I honestly don't want anyone to know, and I doubt they will, because the implants will be small and also, no one is likely to suspect someone my age would have them. (I live in an area where plastic surgery is relatively uncommon).\nI am confident I am making the right decision for ME, and I know that is all that matters, but I'm really, really scared about dating. I'm getting silicone implants which feel pretty darn natural (I felt the implant, it's actually squishier than my current breasts, which are firm). I am just scared about being dumped or judged for my surgery. Guys can be really cruel online, stating they'd never date a woman with implants and that implants are disgusting. \nAm I setting myself up to be forever alone? Would it really be such a big deal if you found out your smart, pretty and modest girlfriend had implants? I have no idea! Tell me your thoughts, and do be honest! I need to be prepared for what to expect.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: 19(M) looking for advice. Single, never had a GF\nPOST: It all started in early high school when I started obsessing over girls. Back in those days, I was confident and not nervous. I was the star Linebacker on my football team and it made my confidence high. During the time, I had many girls approach me (I didn't have to work for it). Most of them were obsessed and stalked me around the school. Many of my peers would make fun of me for always being around ugly girls (they would stalk me). Although I had all the ugly girls stalk me, the hot ones thought I was a creeper/weirdo. I do have Aspergers and was in Special Ed in highschool. \n    \n   Over the years, I was bullied so much that my confidence shrunk to the point that I wanted to kill myself. Even if I fought the bully (I always won by KO), nothing would happen. I started to put girls above me. By my senior year, I realized that I haven't gotten any girls yet. I then started to seriously look for girls and started talking to them. Of course, I came out empty handed.\n   \n   During my later/end of highschool, I missed out on spring break and quit the football team. I had no friends and was too scared to leave the house. I only went to school twice on my last highschool semester. The worst part was prom. I asked out many girls to prom and got rejected. This happened so much that I missed prom. I really regret my decisions.\n      \n   Now, I am a college student that is still a kissless guy. I go to parties every weekend and end up getting kicked out. I have tried many ways to solve my anxiety/confidence issues. For example, I would see a therapist. I saw 10 therapist and no one helped. I also box professionally now (Only make $10K a year) and still single. Boxing did help my confindece a little bit. I am not scared to leave my house anymore. I got confident enough and started asking out girls. I ended up getting rejected by over 100 girls.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been out of hospital and maintaining myself for over three years now. I wouldn't say that my anorexic tendencies have entirely disappeared (I doubt they ever will) I've been happy and eating healthily without much trouble for a long time.\n\nToday I got in to a stupid argument with my mum. Shopping for clothes today she suggested a pair of shorts that I might want to try on. I didn't want to, simply because I don't like to wear shorts, but she took offense. Only just now I discovered that she's convinced that I don't want to wear them because I'm concerned about my body image. This is absolutely not true (I'm quite happy with how I look now) I tried explaining this to her, but she refuses to believe me. This isn't an isolated incident, similar things have occurred before, like if I ever say I don't want to eat something it must be because I'm still anorexic. Sometimes I feel like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't: if I want to exercise it's because I'm anorexic, if I don't want to exercise it must be because I'm afraid of overexercising again.\n\nI'm posting here because I don't really have anyone I feel like I can talk to offline. My dad is overseas for the Christmas with my step-mum, although I never really speak to him that much anyway, and I don't think my brother would want to listen. My parents got divorced when I was 10, and I feel like my family has been slowly drifting further and further apart, and I don't really feel like I've ever had a male role-model in my life. My mum is really the only person I have, and I want to be able to talk to her, but I'm gradually feeling like I can less and less.\n\nIt seems like the best option might be to try and distance myself from her a little, and I desperately want to move out of home, but I won't be able to for at least another year.\n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: A prime observation.\nPOST: Walking back from the gym today I was thinking about prime numbers and how there is no identifiable patterns when it comes to their values and sequential order.  I started playing around with them by listing them from smallest to greatest and plotting them using their values as the y values and their number in the sequence as their x value (integers 1,2,3...).  I found that the graph seemed fairly simplistic  then I used a curve fit   through some coding and trial and error using a matlab file that I wrote up I found that the curve was never more than +-10 off from the actual value of the prime at that integer.  I tried googling this observation but can't seem to find those magical keywords to get my results.  Does anyone know if this has been researched?  I feel like this is basically a pattern of primes; knowing that if you find the equation to this curve and plug in any integer the value you get will be +-10 units from a prime number.

I started dating my SO about 2 years ago and we have been living together about 6 months now. When we first started, I knew I never felt the \"butterflies\" but I truly enjoyed being with him and we made great partners.\n\nWhen I look to the future - I see him there. I want to have kids with him, I want to travel with him, I know our careers will match well and we will agree on all the important issues. \n\nUnfortunately, I am starting to feel more indifferent to the relationship. I believe this is because I know he is so much more in love with me than I am. He always tries to kiss me, do things for me, etc. I am feeling really upset because I feel like I'm lying to him and being unfair that I don't want to do these things in return. It's gotten to the point that he just really irritates me and I feel like I can't escape because we do EVERYTHING together (we work together right now as well as living together). I just want to take a moment to breathe.. but I know I can't without hurting him.\n\nI don't want anyone else.. I just miss being alone, living by myself, not feeling the responsibility that relationships require. I know that if I truly loved him this would be easier, so I'm begging you reddit, please help me love my boyfriend.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [47M] wife [45F] and I appear to be on the brink of divorce. Is it possible to recover, or am I naive to think we can make it work?\nPOST: Married 16+ years, together almost 19 in all. My [47M] wife [45F], has been over the past few weeks telling me that we're not good for each other, that we've been unhappy for years, and that I shouldn't want to be with her, because she thinks she is the source of my unhappiness. Her unhappiness stems from my being unhappy, in her words.\n\nWe've recently moved across country for her job, and I am in a work from home situation which is, by its very nature, a bit isolating. On the plus side, I have really improved my relationships with my kids [12M, 14F], and my wife has absolutely noticed that my dynamic with them has never been better. A lot of stress on the family, but the kids are thriving here in our new community, and we just bought a house here which has allowed us to feel a bit more settled.\n\nWe've found a great therapist, and my wife has now seen her once or twice. I feel like we're in a pretty dark place with no easy path out, but that if we each decide that we want to make this work, we can find a way with our therapist's help.\n\nI think we could recover -- but I would like to know if anyone here has gotten to the point where their spouse (or you) has (have) said, \"I don't think this is going to work\", but somehow, managed to get to a better dynamic in your relationship. There are a few things she's said recently that are encouraging, but mostly, it feels like she wants to end it. I know I can't make her want to stay, she has to get there of her own accord. But if you've dealt with these feelings of losing hope for the future of a relationship (one with almost 20 years, 2 kids and a lot of history), how did you do it?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: Going on \"dates\" vs. \"dating,\" what is normal as far as exclusivity?\nPOST: I've been on a few dates with a woman, we are both in our early 40s and divorced with kids of our own. I told her I am enjoying her company and getting to know her. But I was clear that this was going to be a slow process, as I wasn't ready for a relationship. There has been nothing physical between us. She asked if I was going to \"date\" other women. I said that I would go on a date with another woman, but I'm not looking for \"dating\" as in a relationship, so it would be very casual. She said she didn't think 2 people could get to know one another if one person was still willing to date around. My opinion is that \"going on dates\" is casual, and as long as people are honest about it, it's not a big deal. I said I'm not looking for casual sex.\n\nAnyhow, she said that this is not normal, that people can only go on dates with one person, and if that doesn't work out, they move on. So her point of view is you go exclusive and only go on dates with one person until you aren't \"dating\" them anymore. I think that's already jumping into exclusivity, which is \"dating\" and a \"relationship.\" \n\nAm I off base here? Don't people go on dates with different people until they decide to enter into a relationship (and then sometimes not even then?). Maybe I'm missing something here... was married for a long time until a few years ago...\nTL;DR:"}

I still have contact with both, and it's fairly amicable, they do get on. Despite this, I don't have a good relationship with my family; my parents or my sister; i tend to rely on my friends.

Apparently there is  chemo that could treat this but he is very old and has a weak immune system so its uncertain if it would work or even be worth trying. \n\nI was in London today and saw him while i was nearby.

He has dated many girls in both high school and college which has always been fine with me. Since about junior year of high school he has had feelings for me which I learned both from him and our other friends. After I told him I didn't like him we stopped talking as much and hanging out. About four years ago he dated a girl for a year and we got close again. After they broke up he got super clingy to me.

He seemed okay at first with it but now his clinginess has been increased about ten fold. I'm currently only employed as a babysitter/nanny and most of my time is spent being a caregiver to my 94 yo grandmother.

Then she said something along the lines of \"You see this? This is a Dummy. This goes in your mouth, to keep you quiet\" at this point I thought, well thats a bit odd, sometimes people say things like this jokingly and it might be ok depending on their relationship. \"And if you keep making that whining noise I'm going to get you one to shut you up\". Yeah, she was publicly shaming a disabled boy to teach him a lesson. He wasn't making any noises when he came in, he only started to get upset when she said that. After that she looked at me and said \"Ok thanks, I'm not buying it I just had to do that to stop him making that noise, its just been going on all day\"\n\nI feel disgusted, I get that you need to discipline and teach children, and that it might be harder if they're disabled in some way, but even if the kid doesn't have difficulties then you do not publicly shame them, and make me a part of it, just to \"teach them a lesson\".

I feel like I am not good at advice in this category because I'm 24, working full time, financially independent, and am virtually debt-free.  \n\nHe works at a call center and makes decent money but he hates his job.  He often complains of wanting to move somewhere with his career path but he doesn't seem to have the drive to find another job.  He's dropped out of school a few years ago and defaulted on his student loans. Through stories he has hinted that he has a lot of debt and may have let his credit score slip a lot.  I know these are very hard stressors for anyone at any age as well.\n\nHe seems to dwell on the future and past at the same time.  His attitude reflects, 'I'm 31 and I haven't accomplished and I never will because I'm not in my twenties'.  From what I've gathered, he's feeling remorseful that he's \"played around\" during his 20s and not buckled down with his peers and pursued education, careers, family life, etc.  \n\nOur relationship is very great, we're a happy and healthy duo and we love each other and get along very well.  I really feel like we have it going and I know he feels it too. He just occasionally reflects on this topic and I feel like this may be a 30-something struggle that I cannot relate or give advice on, being a 20-something.  I wish there was just something I can say to help him realize it's okay or give him good advice on what to do.\nTL;DR:"}

I met an absolutely amazing girl a few days ago. I really do like her and she feels the same way. Going on our first date this Friday. Because I truly like this girl and want to get into a serious relationship with her, I knew that things with Rachel and my other fwb had to come to an end.\n\nCalled my other fwb last Friday night, she was cool with it and wished me good luck with the new girl. Called Rachel as well and told her we're done, explained the circumstances. Rachel unfortunately didn't handle this very well. She came over without my invitation and was a mess, crying hysterically and begging me not to leave her. I didn't really understand what she meant by this since we were only ever fwbs and she knew this. She told me she would do anything so that I would stay with her and eventually her sobbing turned into anger. She started screaming, asking what the new girl had that she didn't and basically called me a sexist pig who used her like a toy. A bunch of other horrible insults followed and fearing that she would get violent, I ordered her to leave or I would call the police. After some resistance she finally left and said that I'm making the biggest mistake of her life and I would definitely regret it.\n\nI kind of expected Rachel to react poorly and before I had the conversation I met up with a good friend of mine and upon his good advice I set up a camera to record the interaction, just in case shit went south. I do have audio and visual footage of our encounter and it will be used if she ever tries to do some nasty shit to me.\n\nNeedless to say I cut contact with her entirely. I'm a bit frightened as to what she might do as revenge but I'm ready to handle whatever it may be. I'm a bit upset that the breakup didn't go smoothly but honestly I didn't expect her to freak out like that, considering how she agreed to the terms of our arrangement very explicitly.

When she ended it, we'd been together for two days short of 11 months. She left for college 2 months ago, so we'd been long-distance for that long. After those two months, she decided that putting together her new life at college was her top priority, and she decided that a long-distance relationship couldn't be part of that life. She broke things off on November 13th, and here I am today, still hurting but more self-aware than I was two weeks ago.\n\nI went through all sorts of phases in the time between then and now. In fact, I'm probably still going through them. The worst phase was on Thanksgiving Day -- which was going to be the next time we saw each other. I had something of a breakdown and ended up sending some unwise texts. She took it poorly and said, quote, \"Never talk to me again. I am done.\" That didn't help. One of my family members called a crisis line and handed the phone to me. I talked things through and I feel like they helped me get my feet back under me. It's almost surreal how soothing those people's voices are.\n\nAnyway, what I came to realize is that the relationship was fundamentally unhealthy for me, and until now I was too blind to see it. I had devoted myself to her to such a degree that I didn't even ever think about what *I* wanted. Or perhaps a better way to say it is that what I wanted was to give her what she wanted. If I could make her smile, I would be happy. There's nothing wrong with that on its own, I don't think. At the time, it felt like that just showed how much I cared about her. But what I realize now is that it was *all* I cared about -- I lost sight of myself as an individual. And now that she and I are done for good, I'm realizing that I don't know how to get that back.\n\nWhen we were together, I was living for her. Now I see that I have to live for myself.

I pinched my leg at work, got a bruise, and the blood from it settled in my foot. It's not painful at all. It just looks like I have a severely sprained ankle. The advice from the doctor was to elevate it.\n\nSo at night I put a couple pillows under my foot to keep it up. This had been working great until last night/this morning. My bed is about waist height. Perfect for rolling out and standing up. My alarm goes off and I swing my legs out to stand up. In a fraction of a second, in this groggy half asleep drunken state, I think my leg has been chopped off when I try to stand up. All of my momentum was going forward, and my leg supporting all of my weight was dead asleep. My leg buckled, I feel to a knee, and momentum carrying me forward sent me head first into my desk. I hit with such force things were flying off the desk. I've hit my head hard before and knew I needed to be seen, so I drove to my doctor and I have a mild concussion. What was supposed to be me waking up early for an extra shift turned in to me not being able to earn money for 2 weeks.\nTL;DR:"}

We've stayed friends and been in the same friendship group all the way into the third year. \n\nTowards this Xmas we spent a bit more time together, went out for dinner just us two watched films and stuff on our own and just chatted a lot more. I think she's very attractive and a really cool person and I feel as though I should tell her I wish we could be more than friends but I doubt she would feel the same.

We've been having sex pretty regularly for the last week and a half and I think she's pretty cool (not wifey material, but enjoyable company). \n\nLast night we were at a party and each doing our own thing (we aren't dating so I don't really stay by her side), and she was all upset that I wasn't paying enough attention to her. She tells me she likes me, pulls me into a dark area, makes out with me and spends the rest of the night engaging in physical contact etc.\n\nAt the end of the night, I invite her back to my place which has been fairly common for us and she agrees, but at the last moment bails and tells me that she just wants to go home. She tells me she'll visit me today. She confirms these plans this morning but never shows up.\n\nShe doesn't even tell me she isn't going to come, but that she is 'hungover' so she couldn't make it. I find this really hard to believe since both of us barely drank last night and she sent this message at 7 PM. \n\nI told her not to worry about it, and she says something about my living far away made it tough to find a way over here. \n\nI feel pretty confused about the IOIs here, but think, ultimately, that if she was really that into me she would have shown up.\n\nI should also note, that I just got out of a LTR with a cheater. There was a gut feeling in the beginning of that relationship that things were going to go south and they did (it took 2 years for me to realize it).

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: feel like my boyfriend (22M) of 4.5 years and I (21F) are having routine conversations, am I worrying about nothing? Have any couples experienced this and how did you fix it?\nPOST: Been together since high school, talked about marriage and kids, we're serious about each other. The start of our relationship we used to talk all night. Recently, maybe in the past year or so, our conversations over text message have become very routine, just asking about each others day, what did you have for lunch etc etc. We hardly ever speak on the phone, mainly because I get awkward on the phone. In person we are fine, have great conversations, but I've noticed some awkward silences here and there lately (might just be me who thinks they are awkward?). Other than the routine text messaging, not talking on the phone and occasional awkward silences, there is nothing to indicate we are in trouble. Sex life is great, better than usual actually. We go out on dates regularly and are very affectionate, spend lots of time together. So I'm not sure if these issues (boring conversations over text message, occasional silences) are common for a long term relationship, as this is both our first relationship so neither of us have anything to compare it to. My having social anxiety and being socially awkward could be more of the issue rather than our relationship, because this is a common problem in my friendships as well, and it's become more noticeable in my relationship recently. Basically what I would like is to have our emotional connection strong again, have more interesting conversation, and maybe even start talking on the phone more often. So my questions are:\n\n-Are these common issues in a long term relationship? \n-Has anyone experienced this in their relationship and how did you get your conversations/relationship in general interesting again?\nTL;DR:"}

Some seriously useless and obscure programming (multi function printer/fax/scanners) along with tech support and customer service (which was ironically quite decent comparatively).

We started out as friends with benefits and at the time he smoked. About two months in, he asked me if I minded if he smoked and I told him that I didn't, but would not want to be in a long term relationship with a smoker (mainly for health reasons). After that, he made an active attempt to quit smoking and after a couple more months, we entered a serious relationship.\n\nAt about 9 months, we became long distance while I was doing an internship abroad. He had gone without a cigarette for a while by then and I thought he was in the clear. I was gone for two months and came back about a week ago to find that he had been smoking for the entire time I had been gone. We talked to each other every single day and he didn't mention that he had started smoking again a single time.\n\nWhen I confronted him about it, he played it off like it wasn't a big deal and said that he didn't remember the conversation we had at the beginning of our relationship about me not wanting to be with a smoker (which I believe is true, not that it really matters).\n\nI love him. I'm happy with him except for this. But he says that even though he wants to quit in the future, he enjoys smoking and quitting is too hard. When I ask him to give me a timeline for quitting or to start taking active steps towards quitting, he just evades, and I don't think I can deal with him smoking, let alone him lying to me about it for two months.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Pets\nTITLE: Help with socializing semi-feral 7-month-old cats\nPOST: Specifically, one of our two siblings (female, if it matters) is stubbornly resistant to becoming comfortable with my girlfriend and I. \n\n**Short history**\nWe started fostering the two cats about 3 weeks ago with very little information concerning their back story. They both started off extremely fearful but *not* aggressive; they were also quite sick, so we had to force-feed them a whole bunch of medication for the first couple weeks. We've gotten the basics down, like being present when feeding, slowly/gently begin touching them when they allow, confine them to the bathroom for the most part, and allow some limited exploration outside. Only once with each cat were we forced to corner them and pick them up (scruffing+a towel to avoid scratches), when they got out of our reach in the apartment. \n\nNow, the male is being readily affectionate, playing with us, eagerly exploring, and has no problem eating with us, although he still doesn't appreciate being picked up and is skittish when not in the bathroom. The female, though, is still nearly as skittish as the day we got her; only very seldom will she willingly accept petting or touching of any kind, and will only eat next to us if we remain completely motionless. She will sometimes purr when she's sleepy and enjoys being petted, but any attempt to move her or pick her up, however delicate, even if it's just 2 inches to my lap, will absolutely traumatize her. I really want to make sure we do the best we can to prepare them for adoption and I feel like it's important to get them comfortable with being picked up. I don't know how to do it with her. Positive reinforcement doesn't seem to be an option because she won't even sniff treats after being picked up in any way, and doesn't respond to any amount of petting even though she starts off relaxed. I also feel like it's a time-sensitive issue; the longer she goes like this, the lower our chance of success, although I could be wrong. A final note: she seems perfectly okay to explore the apartment, especially with her brother, so it seems like she's just really afraid of *us*.\nTL;DR:"}

If you worked both I'd have to terminate you because its conflict of interest.\"  I said okay but got the job anyways.  Is this really considered conflict of interest and can I be fired for working both places or is my boss in the wrong?  If I were to get fired would it be worth suing or no?  Thanks!  And also Taco Bell knows i work at Dunkin and have no problem with it so is it up to the employer to determine this or is it a state/country wide guideline?\nTL;DR:"}

A week later we found she was pregnant.\n\nFast forward, I have been there through the whole process when she informs me, I pay half of whatever child expense we need.  I visit every week, for 2 hours at her brothers house, which is where she resides.  I have asked for more time, a couple hours privately (pick up at 9am, bring back at 5pm), unsupervised by her.  She has said that she is not ready to have him away for that long.  I would ask for overnights but she won't even give me a couple hours, so that is out of the question.  She let me take him for the holidays (9am-5pm) and called it and \"acception, do to the holidays\".\n\nI do not drink or use drugs, I have a great job.

We moved into a two bedroom apartment in a great area of town that was probably about as much as either of us could possibly spend on a place while still affording our other bills.\n\nWe were inseparable before, but right before we moved in, she got her first serious boyfriend. Since then, she's been involved pretty much only with him. I get it. I've been there. She sleeps here maybe once or twice a week, but she's usually at his house. He's shopping around for a new job and is not at all picky about where the job is. She's made it abundantly clear to me that she will move wherever he is hired. Recently, he was flown across the country for an interview. He ended up not taking the job, but it still put things into perspective to me. Should my BFF move out, I'm going to be in this apartment alone. I most certainly cannot afford this apartment by myself. I want stability, I want to live in an apartment where I can reside for at least two or three years until I'm ready to purchase a house. The way things are now, I feel like I'm at the mercy of her boyfriend's career plans.\n\nWe haven't necessarily talked about the end of our lease, since there are still about five months left on it... And, since I never see her, I feel kind of uncomfortable around her now and a little bit afraid to bring up serious topics. I came across a great one bedroom apartment last week and I'm going to look at it, and possibly sign the lease, tomorrow. I will finish out our lease per the contract I signed, but I do need to tell my friend my plans so she can make other arrangements to either move in with her boyfriend or find another place (I'm pretty sure she can't afford this place on her own).\n\nHow do I bring this up in a non-super-awkward manner? What do I say? I hate the thought of texting her about it, but I'm lucky if I see her in person even once a week. She's a rare sight around these parts.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Can opposite personalities have a solid relationship that lasts? F(20) M(19) Over a year together\nPOST: Background:\n\nMy boyfriend and I are complete opposites personality wise. I'm not talking about likes/dislikes or hobbies. In that sector we have a good mix of things we agree and disagree on and that's fine because it keeps it interesting. What I'm talking about is that I am a very emotional, pensive person. I interrogate myself on everything and always search for deeper meanings. When people talk to me their physical language and tone is more important than the actual words. I also have BPD that causes me to feel everything extremely whether it's positive or negative emotions. I am verbal, physical and demonstrative about my affection. \n\nOn the other hand my partner is pretty much the opposite of these things. He doesn't notice physical language or tone and only takes in consideration words that are said. He does show affection through actions and is a sensitive person but doesn't show it. When I want to talk with him about my deepest thoughts and worries he listens but doesn't share his side because he doesn't think about these things. He even claims that he never thinks with words, he just always knows. He is also very patient and logical while I tend to let my emotions get the best of me.\n\nThe issue:\nHe obviously is a very kind and caring person in his own way and I love him for who he is, but sometimes his neutrality can take it's toll on me. If I look at our relationship with the 5 languages of love I use all 5 of them, especially physical touch. He gives through acts of service and time. Early in our relationship I explained to him that I'd like it if he would show physical affection outside of foreplay and he says he tries but he hasn't improved at all. I sometimes feel rejected and unloved because I am the only one who initiates physical contact (cuddling, kissing, etc). I know he doesn't do it on purpose; it is just the way he is and try to not let it get to me.\n\nSo what are your experiences with someone with an opposite personality? Is it possible to make it work over time if we both invest ourselves?\nTL;DR:"}

I just moved on a new flatshare with a guy and a girl, and yesterday we were having our first night out: predrinks, drinks at a pub, and more when coming back to the flat.\n\nWe definitely managed to break the ice, maybe way too much: after some really light flirting (I am your average guy really oblivious to hints & more...) the girl took me to her room and told me that she wanted to cuddle.\n\nShort version, in my intoxicated state, I liked the idea of having sex with her, but I left for my room, she came back to pick me up only in panties and a top 1 hour later. I followed her in her bed, we made out a lot, but she draw a line and we didn't go too far, even managed to keep our underwear on!\n\nI left to my room after she felt asleep.\nToday I'm very happy she prevented us from doing it, and I'm concerned about my relationship to her and the flatshare environment in general.\n\nAs I told her when we started kissing, for me this was only casual, and I kind of fished for information, seeking if she would be interested in a FWB, which she wasn't keen on; but also telling me that she wasn't looking for anything serious at this moment of her life.\n\nI left for work this morning, and won't be able to discuss that with her until tonight. I don't know how she feels about that yet, and I want to find the right words to get her to understand that my priority is having a good (platonic) relationship with my flatmates, and a good atmosphere at home, ideally being close friends.

It's the first relationship for the both of us, and we have fallen pretty hard for each other. We talk about the future all the time, our sex life is pretty great, etc etc. \n\nSo, I have no idea why really, but I have always had a desire to have sex with other females.

My gf and I have even talked a few times over the course of our relationship about the idea of swinging, both of us not really being opposed but she hasn't shown any real desire for it either. \n\nAnyway, long story short, I have been emailing this female for a few days (via a craigslist ad) and we've exchanged pictures. Talked about having sex, everything. If we decide to go through with it, the day of reckoning will be in a few days. I have cold feet. I love my girlfriend. But the thought of sex with this other woman is so unbearably exciting that I still am talking to this other woman. \n\nHave I already gone too far? In other words, I am already going behind my gf's back, so have I already fucked things up beyond repair? Personally, I **don't** think cheating is a complete gamechanger and is **not** grounds for immediate break up (I would NOT break up with my gf if I found out she had sex with another man, if I believed she LOVED him it'd be different... I realize this is a difficult line to draw sometimes though), but I still feel like I will encounter guilt because the way society views this issue. Help?\nTL;DR:"}

We will also have iced tea, water and a homemade non alcoholic punch that can be mixed with soda water.    \n\nI am trying to simplify the glasses situation and was thinking that we could just get stemless red wine glasses for both wine and the cocktails and 12 oz pilsner glasses for the non alcoholic drinks and beer.  \n\nI know martinis won't look ideal in either one, but since the wedding is next month I have a feeling most folks who order cocktails will be getting something on the rocks.  \n\nThoughts?

I consider myself very smart, athletic, and decent looking. However, I have always lacked self confidence and am not sure how to fix this. Even though I realize I should be very confident and ambitious, I find myself scared of failing (especially in new situations) and setting relatively low goals for things so I don't fail to achieve them. I've also always been shy so even today (I just graduated from college) I get nervous talking to new people.\n\nI've been trying since high school to try to get better about this but haven't seemed to have much luck. I always try to find motivation in some way, whether imagining myself succeeding at something or reading motivational quotes, but this usually only works temporarily and by the time I need to actually do what I was motivating myself for, it's gone. It leaves me deflated knowing that I had the courage to do whatever the task was, but now it is gone. It makes me think that a lot of times I get \"phony\" courage (the only reason I was able to build up the courage is because I knew I wasn't attempting the task right away). This shakes my confidence even more and makes it that much harder to believe in myself. \n\nFor example, I will be really nervous when meeting with a client but afterwards think about it and realize there was no reason to be nervous and I could have done so much better. This makes me feel confident that I will be able to do better the next day because I realized I didn't need to be nervous. However, the next day will come and I will be just as nervous with that client as I had been the day before. \n\nIf anyone has any advice that could help with this, I'd really appreciate it. Especially if there is someone who has a similar story to me and found a way to overcome their issues, it would be very helpful.\nTL;DR:"}

Massages are awesome! \n\nAnother thing, I've recieved one blow job from her in the 1 year we've been going out. Her reasoning is it hurts her neck. I usually didn't mind because we'd be having sex 2-3 times a week, but now it's reduced to twice a month. \n\nShe told me how much of an asshole her ex is, forgot her bday, didn't even get her a card or anything.. Then it came to my birthday and she forgot to get me a card. This was pretty painful for me because I put so much effort into hers. \n\nThe other week she said we should go on a break, and then we had an argument. So I organised to go stay at my friends house and have my mum come and help me move some of my belongings. She told me to \"be a man\" and do it myself.

I have issues with girls, in terms of dating and entering relationships. I'm starting College fairly soon and I know College isn't only a great place to further my education, but to also form friendships and relationships. It's easy to find and make friends, get involved with other activities or 'hobbies' that I usually don't partake in, I don't have to put much effort into that, just dating girls. I get extremely nervous.\n\nLast time I tried asking someone out, my whole body was shaking erratically, or I just pause for a few seconds and play things off by saying \"I forget what I was going to ask\" or something to that similar effect. As I said, I don't have much experience in terms of dating girls, or let alone forming relationships.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [18M] am worried about one of my best friends [17M] of 6 years (cause I guess that's important to know)\nPOST: So I had my friend over recently. let's call him Spock. So Spock was telling me that he had been fasting recently, which caught me a little off guard, but he told me it had only been one day, so I didn't think it would be too bad. But he told me latter that night that his parents had been sort of drifting apart lately, and his dad would talk to him about it and it would stress him out.\n\n He said that he didn't eat for a week straight and that his parents made up, maybe because of that. It's also concerning because he is also quite thin and has a pretty psychically demanding job from what I hear.\n\n I'm not sure whether or not he was joking when he said fasting was the key to solving all of his problems, but I at least know that the situation with is parents is something that might be important. When he told me, I didn't know what to say. I mean, my parents divorced when I was very young, so I have no idea what it's like to deal with that because I was too young to get what was going on.\n\n I just want to know what to say so I can help him, because as it stands, I'm a pretty shit friend and just a despicable human being to begin with, but that just might be me in a bad mood right now. Does anyone have any advice as to what I might say to help him in this situation?\nTL;DR:"}

My boyfriend and I have been dating 5 months, but were friends for a couple years now so I know him well. \n\nSo far he and I have been doing very well, I like him a lot, but one thing kind of gets on my nerves when I didn't think it would. Whenever I suggest he post a picture of he and I to instagram or facebook he doesn't do it, and I don't push him to. The thing is, he has many photos up with him and ex girlfriends some of whom he is on bad terms with, but he has still kept them up. And yet, he hasn't put up any picture of he and I, even when we've taken some really good ones. Sometimes when I have one on my phone that I think would be cute, I'll send it to him and kind of suggest he post it online with some witty caption I make up, he laughs about it, agrees, then says something witty back but then never actually does.\n\nAt first I kind of pondered the idea of him being embarassed of the age difference, but I've met many of his friends and he talks me up whenever I'm around with them. So I don't really think it's that. It might be one of his exs (who is also a coworker) who is 25 and would constantly message him about how I'm too young for him when we first started dating.\n\nAm I being like completely crazy? Or could there possibly be something up?\nTL;DR:"}

We have seen each other/slept in bed with one another nearly every day of our relationship.\n\nIn the past few months, it seems as though I have run out of smart or  interesting conversation, or things about our mutual interests (which according to him, aren't many). We play cutesie \"games\" and use baby talk as substitute for actual conversations and usually just stay home and watch TV or a movie. We are still intimate and touchy feely.\n\nWe recently talked about this with one another and he wonders if we are really compatible. I would really like to rekindle what we like and love about each other, but he has a history of shutting me off emotionally. He said he'd work on it. I hope so.\n\nI guess I am just trying to see if anyone else has had a similar problem and see if they have been able to salvage their relationship. \nI have suggested things like reading a book together, starting with a book on improving relationships.

That seems pretty close to the cutoff for dating that's not \"creepy\". Second, it would break the \"half your age plus 7\" rule.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: My ex [20F] wants me [21M] to stop ignoring her\nPOST: Hey guys! This is a throwaway (this would easily be tracked on my main). Basically, this girl was my first relationship and I only dated this girl for about 1-1.5 months (I left the country for study abroad after that). I never got too handsy with her or anything because I was so inexperienced that I wasn't sure what to do right (though I did have my moments ;) ). Because of this, I feel like the relationship lacked some aspect of intimacy. During study abroad I tried to send messages to her on facebook, which it stated that she saw (but never replied to). I just assumed that she was done with me already, and, as tough as it was, just decided to move on.\n\n2 months later I arrive back home. I live my life like normal: school, work, all that good stuff. I've run into her personally once since arriving back (we were simply passing by each other on the street) and she could tell I was uncomfortable and did not want to talk to her (I said hi but avoided eye contact after a bit). I soon felt like if I were to ever get over her and return completely to normal, I had to remove seeing her from my life. I removed her from snapchat first (because I thought it would be the most inconspicuous), and I heavily debated removing her from facebook and blocking her on instagram (never followed through with that).\n\nCue 1.5 months later, she runs into my roommate and tells him to tell me to stop ignoring her. I feel like she may feel like I'm doing this to spite her, and I legitimately feel bad. I don't know how to feel because part of me kinda has some feels for her still, but then there are other girls that I've gotten involved with that (in my opinion) I have a brighter future with. I know I need to talk to her in order to rectify the situation, but my brain literally feels battered in this situation.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I just got robbed. What should I do?\nPOST: So my apartment got robbed (upstairs duplex) while I was at work and my girlfriend was at school. Our dog was here but thankfully he's okay (from what I can see). Our downstairs neighbor called the police when she saw the backdoor window shattered in the late afternoon. There was a window between 9:30 and 4:30 that the burglars could have come in. From what the policemen said, they probably spent no more than a minute in the place and took whatever they could find. To be honest, I wouldn't care so much if they hadn't stolen my late mother's diamond ring that I was going to use to propose to my girlfriend. They took a laptop, imac, slr camera, swiss watches, ipad, etc... They hit the jackpot. What is worse is that we don't have renter's insurance because my girlfriend never followed through with it after getting an initial quote. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do at this point. The only folks that I even suspect are two groups of movers. One small moving company back in August 2011 and two other guys that I saw doing a moving job on our street that I got their numbers with. I don't want to judge or profile anyone but I want to make sure I make the best decisions moving forward. I was thinking about calling the moving companies and asking for their full names to send them late \"thank you letters.\" I'm going to run around the city at the pawn shops pretending I'm looking for certain kinds of rings that would fit my mother's.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [29 F] with my fianc\u00e9 [31 M] of 2 years disagree about marijuana\nPOST: I enjoy smoking marijuana. I have a very stressful career and at the end of a crazy week a little bit of marijuana relaxes me and helps me sleep. I sometimes suffer from really bad headaches and the only thing that helps is marijuana. Before I met my fianc\u00e9, I used to smoke about 1-2 a week (about 3-5 \"hits\" from a pipe). I usually would smoke alone, but sometimes with my sisters who are also my roommates. The first few months when we started dating, marijuana did not come up in conversation. I do not fit into the stereotype that people usually associate with marijuana. I have a masters degree and now a lucrative, successful career. Eventually marijuana came up in conversation in the context of medical marijuana. I told him about how I use it for my headaches and stress relief. At the time he mentioned he does not use marijuana, but was not outright against it. He told me he had a bad experience once when he unknowingly ate a plate of marijuana brownies and got very sick. As our relationship has progressed he has grown increasingly resistant to my using marijuana at all. His reasons are that he does not want his wife to have a bad reputation as a pothead, and he does not want our future children to have a mother that smokes pot. I remind him that I'm not necessarily open about my marijuana use (I smoke alone or with my sisters) and by my own achievements I think it's very clear I am not a lazy pothead. Also, I assure him that I would not smoke during pregnancy nor would I ever let my children see or know about it. Every other aspect of our relationship is incredible. If he made me choose between marrying him and continuing to smoke marijuana, I would never smoke again. But, I cannot say I wouldn't be a bit resentful. He drinks beer moderately and sometimes smokes cigars to relax and unwind. I do not enjoy doing either of those, that is what marijuana is for me. \n\nHow should I convince him that my marijuana is really not that different from his beer/cigars? I love him but I really wish I didn't have to stop enjoying marijuana... what should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

At the same time, the thought of having seen her and talked to her for the last time in my life is terrifying.\n\nWe also disussed what each of us could change to find the right person.

I needed the room to be silent, but the Special Ed aide in the room kept speaking somewhat loudly and out of turn.  She was doing this because she was trying to help some of the kids.  However, if you ask me, she was being unnecessarily loud and obnoxious.  She was also helping a kid during a test.  When I went up to her and the special needs student to try to quiet her down, I made the mistake of saying \"Does (The Full Time Teacher) know that you help these students during a test?\".  (I was trying to keep her from continually speaking when I asked the room to be quiet.)  She replied tersely with \"This child has autism and just had chemo\".  So basically what I got from her was that she was just going to do whatever she wanted because this kid has cancer and autism and therefore I am out of line for even speaking to her.  Another adult entered the room and started hovering.  At this point I felt like they were taking over the class, so I made the mistake of asking the new adult figure in the room who she was, and what exactly the function of the other adult was supposed to be.  That confrontation sent the Aide out of the room crying and refusing to speak to anyone.  Then, the other adult told me that she was the Sp. Ed Administrator.  At that moment, one of the kids decides to flip out and go berserk.  If I hadn't been dealing with two unknown adult figures in the room, I don't think that that would have happened.  The administrator walked out of the room and took that kid with her, left the door open, and called the office.  Since the class was being good, I wanted to handle the situation with the kid on my own, but my toes were being stepped on by the administrator.  I got outside, talked the kid back into reason, and finished the class.  The rest of the day went great.\n\nUntil after all the kids left and I went to the office, where the secretary harshly defended the emotionally hurt and personally offended Aide.\nTL;DR:"}

Before he moved I fell in love with him and every time I've seen him since then I've fallen back in love with him. He knows how I fell and used to say that he loved me too in the same way. We're currently not dating/are apart at the moment but he's coming to town soon and I'm not sure if I should even see him. Recently I've been noticing some red flags. \n\nHe turns arguments around on me and manages to place the blame on me and always has a way of pulling me back to him. I slept with someone else after he moved assuming I'd never see him again. A month later he comes into town (I didn't know he was going to see me) and we get back together. However, I found out that he'd been texting another girl and was going to hook up with her had he not gotten back together with me. We worked stuff out and I told him if he ever did that again I'd never speak to him again. \n\nCurrently we aren't dating however, when we did break up he said he'd prefer I didn't sleep with anyone else and if I was going to that I tell him before I did. Still being head over heels for him, I agreed and asked that he do the same, he agreed. \nThe other day I got a text from him saying that he slept with someone else and he then proceeded to play it off as no big deal. He didn't understand while I was so upset about it, then told me I had no right to be mad at him. \n\nThe thing is though I love this guy with all my heart and I know for a fact that he used to love me. He's been my best friend since we met and had continued to be even when we were in rough water. He also found this post and then questioned me about it . I don't know if it's time to say goodbye forever or how to if I did.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been thinking it's because my self esteem has gone way down, and also, after we started dating I put less and less effort into my other friendships because I felt like he was close enough to talk about everything to. I would not be surprised if he said the same thing about himself. If you need more detail about how I feel about him, check my unsentletters post.\n\nI also know that we're both super young, not interested in marrying for many many years, and not interested in a family or any sort of commitment other than schools and careers, so I think that moving to the same city as him, maybe the same apartment, is kind of silly. I'm not even an adult yet so thinking that we could last long is also silly. \n\nIf I did decide that we need to stop, I have no idea how to do it. Communication has been bad since we were apart while we still were close, and since we aren't close now when we can talk in person. He also says frequently that he's ready to follow me wherever, so he has a more hopeful view than I do.

She protects her pack doggedly, even when no protection is needed. She's incredibly bright, which is part of the problem. She learns tricks almost instantly, choosing which ones to keep and which to ignore.\n\nHere's the behavior I'm worried about:\n\n**At the dog park** - She used to be great off-leash. She came when called. She rarely played with other dogs, but happily ignored them. Over time, she developed a habit of burrowing herself into the ground when another dog approached and then popping up to rush the dog at top speed. She always just rushes right by them, but it scares the hell out of people, so I've been putting her back on the leash.\n\n**On walks** - We're walking along, calm and happy, when a person approaches with another dog. She pretends to ignore the dog until the last possible second (giving me hope that it'll all be okay). Then, she flips out. Barking, growling, tugging wildly at the leash. If we go over and greet the dog, she's totally fine, but it's hard to convince someone that \"she's okay\" when she's foaming at the mouth.\n\n**At home** - Wild, upset barking when a stranger comes to the door or a car pulls into the driveway. Very different from the \"oh hey something exciting is happening\" bark. The barking stops quickly, but the outburst is sudden, loud, and happens multiple times a day.\n\nI've tried the BarkBusters method (growling at her to show dominance), but it doesn't work in her moments of panic. More recently, I'm trying positive reinforcement, but she ignores rewards in moments of panic. She always looks nervous and watchful. I want a dog that doesn't scare other people...not sure what to do next.\n\nWork your magic, pet-enthusiasts of Reddit!\nTL;DR:"}

We had loads of fun, agreed to do that again and left. We used to chat day and night and the same continued after we have met too.

We have talked almost everyday. If I didn't write he did and so on. So he was obviously interested.\n\nNow for the last two weeks, he all of a sudden he started not answering messages for days and such and even though I knew he has an hectic schedule I overreacted calling him rude, and made some passive aggressive comments about the whole thing. I have dumb overreactions I should work on that. Then I have sent him an apology text which he ignored. After a week I have sent a random \"I did this and it was fun, wanted to share it with you\" kinda text to which he was completely receptive. We have talked for a while and that's it. A day later, another small conversation over text that I initiated, this time I ended it after two messages because I didn't want to be clingy. Again he was receptive and overall sounded in a good mood.\n\nNow it has been a week and he didn't write or call. I am not experienced with dating, so what should I do? I really want to see him again but I don't want to look like I am desperate. I am not even entirely sure I want to 'date' him. But I quite enjoy his company. I think he is rather attractive.

If people find out I am a child of an affair that is somehow my fault and it turns people off me.  I don't understand why my dad, aunt, uncles, and so on want nothing to do with me. They rejected me like I was nothing and I don't understand why. I did nothing wrong except want to get to know them and yet they reject me. \n\nI don't understand I am their blood and they shun me for something I had no control over. I live in America, Oregon if you want the state I live in. So it's not like I am from some weird country that has traditions against people like me. I Live in the United States, and I am going to be a sophomore at school. I just turned 16 two weeks ago and I thought it would be nice if I met some of my other family. \n\nI don't understand why they don't want to meet me. I play football, I get good grades, I study hard and yet nothing. It all means nothing it's just as fucking worthless and the fucking garbage you throw in the trash every day. I don't understand why my dad would not even like to meet me, that does not make any sense\nTL;DR:"}

This morning she didn't show up so I called and text with no reply so I imagined she just overslept like she has before. Later on I see that she read the text I sent, but still didn't reply. So I call her and get sent to voice mail twice and then on the third call she answers. She tells me she didn't oversleep, so I ask her why she didn't make it to class out of curiosity and she gets seemingly annoyed and says that she doesn't need to keep me updated on every little thing she does in her life, and that she was with her mom and went to a doctors appointment. \n\nI've received this type of answer before at something silly, and I was kind of put off by it. I tell her that I'm not trying to pry into her life and that she doesn't need to tell me her every little move, but that I only expected a simple reply to my text and call telling me that she wasn't going to be at class today. Instead of me waiting for her. \n\nYou see, we kind of have this routine for the past couple months where we go to class together etc, so when something that changes that routine happens such as her going to a doctors appt, is it too much of me to ask for a notification on this? I feel like she's viewing me as some needy boyfriend who needs to know her every action when in reality I'm only asking that she let me know if she's not going to be somewhere when I expect to see her. \n\nWhen I tried to explain myself in this, she just wasn't having it and resorted to what she normally does and replied with sarcastic/pissed off answers, when all I am trying to do is have a mature conversation of how I felt. This happens way too often. I'll feel a certain way about something and when I try to explain my feelings or thoughts she makes it seem like I'm just blaming her or telling her she's wrong. How can I talk to her about this? How can I fix this issue?\nTL;DR:"}

I said yes, and that I wanted to explain my feelings more and why I did what I did. \n\nBasically I went through a very difficult LTR break up many years ago, and I quit drinking three months ago. I'm afraid of what will happen if I fall in love with this girl and get my heart broken in six months.

After 5 days away from the relationship, it was a clear head (not loneliness, I'm fine being alone) that helped me see my feelings.\n\nHow can I regain her trust?

I don't feel like I'm appreciated and that my girlfriend doesn't feel glad to be with me.\n\nIn our relationship, we have developed at a normal pace. We have similar interests while not being parallel to eachother's, and we have a fairly stable amount of intimacy. However, recently I've begun to put the pieces together in my mind and I feel like she doesn't appreciate me that much.\n\nIt feels like even to me that my insecurities are talking, but it's pretty degrading to feel like im in a relationship where I care about her and she doesn't care about me. \n\nThe reason(s) why I am writing this now is because just earlier today, my girlfriend told me she can't hang out with me this afternoon (she needs to do studying for tomorrow) after agreeing she would earlier, and as we were heading home (we take the same train home) she saw her friends and joined them to go shopping. I'm also writing this because I don't hang out with her one on one much, as she isn't free most of the time on the weekends and on friday.\n\nI want to state again that I feel like this is a problem that is developing in my head and I may be overthinking it because this is a highschool relationship, but I still can't help but be disappointed and frustrated with how things are going.

My dad is super supportive, and my mom generally is, though she has trouble understanding a little bit because of her personality. \n\nWe come from a large extended Italian family and our family gatherings are unnecessarily loud at times. They hoot and holler the entire party and scream over really ridiculous things. I have trouble processing a lot of noises at once, and though this has gotten better with age, it still affects me at times and makes me want to shut down. I practice my coping skills and try to get away from the noise, but it doesn't work. \n\nIn addition to this, they make jokes about mental illnesses. Tonight I was at my cousin's birthday party and my family has been making insensitive comments about PTSD and keep making comments about how they have them. \n\nWhenever I bring this up to my mom, she tells me that I need to tolerate things better and that I'm being too sensitive. I talk to my dad and he agrees with me.

I do this with my mom, dad (also found out he was cheating on my step-mom this way), and my ex-boyfriends. I know its wrong but anyway, I looked through my current boyfriend's history last night and he was looking at things like hookups on craigslist, dating websites, and escort sites and porn (tmi: czech street girl porn is what he always watches) all in the same night. So I confronted him about it and he said that a guy in his class told him about escort/hookup websites and he was just looking at them for fun. And he got mad at me for looking through his history, which I totally understand, but said that if I did that again we would break up..which just makes me more suspicious. My fear is that because he always watches the czech porn where a guy walks up to random girls and pays them for sex that he may have a sort of fetish about paying for sex or casual sex. Side-notes: I am the only girl he's ever slept with, we have a normal sex life, he is from another country (korea) so its possible that he was just curious about that, but he's very shy and I find it very difficult to picture him talking to anyone in his class, especially about hookups and escorts.

First here's the particulars:\n\n* 37 years old, no kids, no GF (single tear, recently single)\n* 5 months of emergency\n* Income: $5600.00/mo\n* 10% of income is going to 401k\n* Rent: $1300 (low for this area)\n* Utilities: $120 electric and internet\n* Food: $1200 (horrible I know)\n* $200 monthly on car, no other debt\n* Stuff: $xxx?  I can probably save a lot more\n* Totals: ~30k cash, ~100k 401k, ~200k brokerage\n\nSo, I work in tech and my particular field has great numbers when it comes to unemployment.  Basically I don't think it's going to be hard to find a job.  My current employer may/may not lay me off (I really have no idea how to tell), but if they *do* I'm basically going to get a severance of about ~25k after taxes (have this in writing).\n\nSo I'm not too stressed because with the severance and emergency, and the current climate, I'm probably going to be able to find work.  In fact I'm sorta hoping I get laid off so I can go travel for a couple of weeks or more with some of that severance.\n\nAm I an idiot for thinking this way?  Should I be in hyper red-alert mode or something?  Any of you been in a similar situation where you turned a layoff into an impromptu vacation?\nTL;DR:"}

I've been talking to this girl for about a month now, but I've \"known\" her for two summers. We worked together at a water park and since we were in the same department this last summer we got very close. Anytime we were at work  and i saw her i always went out of my way to talk to her. And I always felt a little better just seeing her smile at me.\n    I make her laugh, she makes me laugh. Whenever I look at her I honestly feel like my hearts stopping. I know it all sounds chessey but honestly as I'm typing this I'm laughing and choking at the same time. Whenever I'm alone to think my mind goes to her.\n     Anyway last weekend we walked in the park and went to a movie, at the end of the night i did it! I kissed her! It was everything i thought it would be shes so beautiful and amazing on the way home I cried like a baby. And I've been in relationships, I've lost my card, but never have I felt like this. \n     All I want to know is if I should date her. Or if I should ask what she wants instead, I know she likes me but idk how much. were going on a date this Saturday and I kinda want to ask her then. \n    Thank you so much for any advice and reading this :), so three questions.

I am also being fairly vague because this is my main and I don't really want to say anything specific.\n\nSo on tuesday (yesterday), a couple people from school and I decided to do this dumb thing. I will admit, I was very involved in said dumb thing, but I was far from the only one. Later, however, a person with authority heard about what had happened. They didn't specifically know who was involved, and so they did that classic \"You're all being punished until one of you confesses.\" thing. One of us, I will call him Andrew, was pissed off. Note: He was involved in  the thing just as much as everyone else. He basically came to me and said \"Hey themrrinzler, I am going to tell her it was all you and James.\" So naturally I was pretty annoyed. However, I later spoke with said person of authority, and they seem to believe that it was only one person. I told them I had no clue who. My question is, what should I do? Andrew is trying to save his own ass, and not much I can do about it. I don't want to blame it on anyone if I don't have to, but it seems like it's wrong letting everyone else get punished for what me, James, Andrew, and another kid were doing.\nTL;DR:"}

We were trying to stay up to wait for something and I didn't want to be awake anymore so I eventually said \"Fuck this, I am going to fucking bed\", etc. He was already angry, saying stuff like \"I just want to strangle you\", etc.\n\nShortly after I went into my bed he ran into the room very aggressively and smacked me on the rear. Not in a playful way, but in a mean way. Then he rushed over me and made me stare him in the face while he told me to stop being a bitch.\n\nI've been in abusive relationships in the past, so I tried explaining to him why this makes me really uncomfortable and brings back lots of old feelings. He doesn't feel apologetic and remorse over it, and he said that if I didn't want to get smacked then I should stop being a bitch.\nI'm not sure how I am supposed to go on about this, or what I should do to make him see why it's not a good idea.\nTL;DR:"}

After, we eventually became really close friends. She started getting serious with the other guy, she babysits babysits his kid, and he is in the middle of getting a divorce. After finding out how awkward I was between them, they decided to break it off and be friends. This happened about a month ago. Also they've known each other since they were little. \n\nSituation:\nYesterday I confronted her with my feelings after her ex started to get more invasive when we started hanging out more (texting her constantly and calling her which she would ignore). All I wanted to do was meet him just to prove to him I'm not a fling, I won't hurt her, and I don't expect her to stop being his friend, just know that I'm here and I'm serious about my feelings for her. I wanted to make as many people as I could happy. Now, she took this as me wanting her to decide between the two of us and is in limbo for the past 24 hours. I've made my feelings for her 100% clear, told her that I'll respect her choice and just want her to be happy with who she chooses. As a side note, she did say she wants a relationship with me prior to this situation. Did I do the right thing? Should I just give her time or push for an answer?

Until the relationship that just ended, the longest relationship I've ever had was 2 weeks and it barely even counts as one. I tend to be afraid to approach women and feel awkward doing so, and while I don't have low self-esteem in other areas of my life, I do lack sexual and romantic confidence.\n\nMy GF [27F] broke up with me last night after being together for 11 months. It wasn't a sudden breakup; the issues leading up to the break were apparent for months beforehand. Now, there were numerous problems with our relationship, but the one that essentially damaged it irreparably was the fact that, due to my lack of sexual confidence, when she would not be interested in sex, I would feel hurt and take it personally. Eventually this led to her wanting to have sex less often, which led to me feeling more hurt, complaining about how our sex life is dying, etc. And it just snowballed into the relationship ending.\n\nThe truth is, neither of us really wanted the relationship to end but neither of us could think of a way to repair it after the damage that had been done. Anything I do now to fix it will be interpreted through the lens of trying to pressure her into sex, and I think it may be difficult if not impossible for me to resolve my issues regarding sex and approval while in a relationship.\n\nI know I am responsible for handling myself properly, and I probably wouldn't have handled the situation in such a blatantly poor manner if this weren't my first long term relationship. I think I wanted sex for approval, which isn't healthy. What I need help with is; how do I become more sexually confident so that the next time I am in a relationship, the same thing doesn't happen again?\nTL;DR:"}

We love each other deeply, but we struggle to communicate about our problems without things spiraling into an argument and we have intimacy issues. Yes, we've tried couples therapy but left because we didn't like the therapist we found. We haven't been able to go to another one since because we've been struggling with scheduling.

She is very outgoing whereas I'm highly introverted. I don't think it would ever work because when she would want to go out and party, I would want to stay in and watch a movie (I don't ever go out to parties. Ever). This is just my personality and I couldn't change it. I hate seeing humans reduce themselves to drunk idiots for the sake of entertainment. I'm not against hanging out with respectable people in a non-alcoholic environment. I'm just against people who think getting drunk is, for the lack of a better word, cool. I will now stop with this digression. \n\nWhat I need to do is politely show that I have absolutely no interest in a relationship while not seeming like a complete asshole. How do I do this to a friend I've known for 2 years? For now I just avoid returning any compliments, but it's not slowing her down. She's always trying to engage me in conversations about relationships and things like that even though I have absolutely no interest. In order to not seem mean, I don't tell her that I don't care. I instead just listen to her and interject when I think it's a neutral thought that wouldn't impact the way she thinks I perceive her.

I like to think of myself as a very openminded sexually expressive person, and honestly the thought of being in a porno really turns me on. So here I am. On one hand I am excited, the other, absolutely dejected that this is what I feel is my best option. But at least by the end of the day on Sunday, after fucking who knows how many guys and girls, I'll have enough money to cover my bills for a month.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm just not really sure what the right approach is.  So, please, don't read this if it is going to make you feel bitter about where you are in the process.  I am always happy to provide tips where I can, though, if anyone has questions.\n\nSo, I will be graduating in December (finally!), and have been pretty steady on the job hunt since August.  I would say about three weeks ago, the interviews really started coming in.  I've had four interviews so far, with four separate opportunities.  One has already offered an internship (immediate start) with \"potential\" to go full time in December, and another offered a second interview.  The other two positions told me it would be a few weeks, so I'm not really stressing over those.  \n\nMy issue is offers for interviews are still coming in.  I have been asked to come in this Thursday, and received another for mid-November (it's a government job, so I'm not put off by the length of time).  \n\nObviously, my goal is to have a position for when I graduate in December.  The internship hasn't (understandably) guaranteed anything, but if they did, I wouldn't have a problem staying there.  I know that nothing is absolute when looking for positions, but should I still be taking all the interviews that I can get?  Should I get through the process with the first four companies, and see where I end up?  I don't want to screw myself over here, but I also don't want to keep taking time off of work and school to go to interviews when I have so much potential...\n\nI have the tendency to take work very personally.  I feel like it is irresponsible to accept an interview and cancel, or even start the process if I'm not 100% committed.  What is the proper way to handle this with HR?  Do they even care?  Should I be in touch and tell the different companies that I am interview other places?\nTL;DR:"}

She said she was exhausted; text was received early morning. \n* Worked out with her a total of 3 times. Usually lasts about 2 hours. \n\nI've been working out with a girl I met at my school's gym for the past few weeks. I just got back from working out with her again. As always, the workout itself was great--we talked, laugh, and overall enjoyed each of our company. \n\nMy plan was to ask her out again at the end of the workout, but this time to a baseball game. I asked her during the workout if she followed any sports and she said she's trying to follow baseball more. So at the end of the workout, I asked if she'd be open to the idea of going to a baseball game (just in general, not particularly with me) and she said she'd love to. So after I asked her that, I asked if she wanted to go to a baseball game with me this Friday--she said she has work that day. Immediately after she switches the subject. It wasn't awkward by any means though. We walked out together and just casually talked. \n\nSo my question is, is it now safe to conclude that she has no interest in me or should I continue to pursue? I mean, she does continually agree to workout with me and our conversations are thoughtful and persistent. Should I have been assertive when I asked her out?\nTL;DR:"}

She refused because she was busy, so he asked out the first girl, who said yes. They aren't together or anything, and they hardly ever talk. Now I want to ask her out. Like I said, I don't want to betray my best friend, and I have no idea if it would be in bad taste to ask her out on a date, particularly since I also want to take her to the cinema. Would it be a kind of douchy move to ask her out, or should I not really worry about it? Also, all of my friends know about how they went to see Star Wars together but no one knows he has a crush on girl #2. I don't want to be seen by my friends as a traitor.\nTL;DR:"}

It was almost 10pm at the time, and my Mom texted me to be home before then, so I did.\n\n   The next day, I was hanging out with two of my friends who sprayed the school, and they showed me where they sprayed the paint. We went to the school and they wrote racial slurs, a swastika and other really dumb things. Now, my friends weren't racist or anything, I just think they wrote that crap because they wanted to be known, or cool or something. I told them how they were fucked in the head for doing it, but they didn't think so. Anyways, we went back to one of my friends house, and around 9 or 10 o'clock pm, 2 police officers came to the door and asked for my friends. They both went outside talking to them for about 20 mintues, when both of my friends came inside and said they were going to the station. After that, I went back home and my friend messaged me saying they might get charged and are going to court in June.

He seems sincere enough and apologizes a lot and wants to make amends.

I thought for sure this woman was my new best friend. I felt like we connected on a lot of things that I hadn't with any other woman (I usually have guy friends). So this was neat to have someone to girl talk with finally, and I have someone I felt I could trust.\n\nYet, I had heard rumors at work about the things she had done in her past (which I don't care about) and the way she is around people (basically that she'll put up a front). I ignored all of this because I like to give everyone a chance and try to see the good in everybody. So it's been almost a year, and things have turned ugly.\n\n I've learned recently about all these lies she has told me. The are not just rumors, the are lies I've caught her in. She also has been putting me down constantly calling me \"bitch, \"whore\", \"miserable\" etc. This is usually when I don't pay her enough attention. I had posted a few days ago on her about the argument we got in where I was just anxious (I have major anxiety/PTSD) and wasn't feeling well. She proceeded to convince me I was pregnant, making me more anxious instead of stopping when I asked her to. Also, yes she is aware of my condition. \n\nSo over the past few days I've let it sit with me and I really feel this relationship is toxic and I don't want to be friends anymore. Yet we also work together, and we've had an extensive friendship at this point. This is a situation I've never really found myself in and I'm not sure how to handle peacefully. She's already lashed out at me (in front of the whole office) just for not saying \"hi\" to her 2 days in a row. So this is where my fear lies with ending it.\nTL;DR:"}

I am a pretty normal guy and I am a laid back person. I do not really have any big ambitions except stable relationships and financial stability. I do not really enjoy bars or anything of sort. I do not even drink alcohol because I just never saw any big deal. I do not smoke either. I like to watch tv, play games, go out to eat at different restaurants, spend time with my family, and just relax. On my time off I usually work on personal projects and spend time with my girlfriend. I do not have any friends really except for my girlfriends. Well ex now. I am a bit upset but I do not know what to do. I tried asking her what happened and she just left. Until yesterday she was fine and she seemed really happy until today morning. I am giving her some space right now because well I think it would be better to let her figure it out and then we can talk. Am I doing the right thing or what should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

We sometimes fight. It's usually something really silly but gets intense. We always are fine after. Anyway, we had a big fight last time and he ended up yelling \"I love you\" at me. It totally shut me up and I just dropped everything and didn't say a word. Next day we met and talked and it was normal, I think?! I honestly wrote it off in the context of the fight, where I had said I'm convinced he HATES me and he was just saying that isn't true. Now he's slightly cold and I'm not sure - but then again we did fight. He ISN'T completely ignoring me though, and when we talk he seems pretty normal...I have no idea how to take this. I thought if he meant \"love\" it would somehow have been a bit different. He almost seems mad at me? Do guys just say I love you ever, like girls? We are close, so it could be friendly?\nTL;DR:"}

He got pretty angry at me for it. He later apologized and said he knew I had not said his feelings etc were not valid.\n\nI don't really know how to deal with this. If I tell him I will be home at 8 when I leave at 6, he will just feel like he can't complain or vent to me?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/jobs\nTITLE: I quit from a job a few years ago, but HR records say I was fired. Is this possible? (x-post: self)\nPOST: Hey Reddit! I'm a recent graduate and have been having troubles finding a job. I've even widened my search outside my home state and sent around 40 or so resumes for jobs from admin support to marketing but, still no luck. So in the middle of my predicament, I ran into an old co-worker and told me the company I used to work for is hiring. I thought I'd seen daylight because at this point, I just needed a job, a decent full time job. And even though this job had nothing to do with my major, it was still a full time job and it would have been more than enough to support me while I couldn't find a job in my field.\n\nSo, with haste, I sent in my resume and cover letter and waited for an interview. My co-worker told me things should be fine since I had quit voluntarily and left with good standings. I gave them a two-weeks notice and never, to my knowledge, had any quarrels with anyone. Well, a week later, they told me I wasn't eligible for re-hiring and when I asked why they told me it's because I was fired. I am very confused about this because I know for a fact that I had sent in my two-weeks notice and it was clear that I had quit on my own. I spoke to a supervisor and my manager then and we had an understanding it was voluntary (I mean one would assume because they both read my notice right in front of me).\n\nNow this is where it got me. Their reasoning behind it is that my supervisor was already going to put the motion to fire me but then heard somehow that I was already getting ready to quit. Upon hearing about my plans, the motion was vacated and just waited for my departure instead. I never knew this until now. And clearly I'm puzzled as to how this is even possible.\nTL;DR:"}

Decent pizza and pretty cheap, so I get in my truck and drive my lazy ass about two blocks away. As I walk up to the door I notice a small child, maybe 8-10 years old walking toward the door with his arms full of pizza, crazy bread and a couple sodas. He leans with his back against the door to open it just as I get close, so I decide to help him out and pull the door open. Well, I guess he was leaning pretty hard and ate shit. Pizza boxes fly, crazy bread erupts into the air in slow motion like those fucking stupid canned snake things. Just as his head cracks off the concrete I pull him up, ask if he is okay (which he was), and help him recover his bounty of little caesars. Looking over I see his parents sitting in an suv aghast at what had just happened to their child at my hands. With that I walk into the store to get my pizza with shame in my heart.\nTL;DR:"}

Currently, as she is still on break, we have been talking everyday for at least an hour or so, and skyping a few times a week. Shes planning on coming out in March for spring break, and we're also planning on making the big step of trying to live together for the summer. She has fears and doubts about this (she tends to have some commitment issues) but the thing was her idea and I think (hope) that she's ready to try it out, because I think it would be a good experience.\n\nHowever, I know that once she's back in school I'm going get jealous/fearful at times, and we won't be able to talk as often. We agreed that \"meaningless\" things were probably inevitable and that any limitations we tried placing on each other would probably lead to a counter-intuitive effect. My fear is not that she'll get with someone else, my fear is that she'll find something meaningful with someone else. I know this is irrational, and I trust her completely. My problem is my own neuroticism and tendency to over-analyze things (which as I'm reading over this post, I think I'm illustrating my point pretty well with this, haha).\n\nWhat I don't want to have happen is to ruin this beautiful relationship by being over-bearing or overly neurotic about what shes doing. I trust her. We have definitely taked about how my own insecurities can come to surface, not because of her actions but just mainly of my fear in losing her.

I don't even care for rent.\nPOST: This man has not paid rent for 3 months and we have been trying to evict this guy for the longest time. The problem is that each time we file the case the lawyer fees become so expensive that we have always had to find a cheaper alternative resolution where the tenant was allowed to stay. I have wanted this man gone for years. He has trashed my place and I just want him out and my place back. I would prefer to find a way to do this without a lawyer.\n\nRecently we gave him a 3 day notice to pay rent or quit. We used a notice that a lawyer wrote for us previously and used that as a template. It seemed quite perfect. When the tenant did not pay rent within 3 days, then we filed an unlawful detainer. The tenant responded by filing a demurrer, which to my understanding, attacks the face of the complaint, but does not deny the allegations against him. He is basically trying to delay his eviction and make it harder for us to evict him because now we need a lawyer. Apparently, according to my lawyer, there was a small mistake in our complaint and the complaint needs to be amended. If we don't amend the complaint, he says the judge will throw out the case on a technicality.\n\nHe claims that he needs 30 hours to complete the whole case including appearing in court with us, thus costing $6,000. I think he's just trying to get the most out of us and that there might be an easier, cheaper way to do this. Is there?\n\nWe don't want to pay him that much. I'm trying to look into alternatives. I was wondering if it would be wiser to throw out the case for now and refile a 30 day notice, saying that the owner or a relative just wants to move in. Or figure out what we did wrong in the first place and refiling the same thing (a 3 day notice). Does this work? I have also seen several cheap eviction services where they will file all the documents, notices, unlawful detainers for you.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Boyfriend [25M] acts like a 15yo teenage boy... Is this normal?\nPOST: I've [26F] been dating my boyfriend for the past four or five months. He's always had some odd quirks, but recently he's started to act like a prepubescent teenager such as sticking his finger (and he picks his nose in public with that finger) into my mouth when I'm sleeping on a plane, bullying me by manhandling me and tickling me (which I absolutely HATE), and saying really mean things just to see me pout since he thinks my pouting face is so \"adorable\" it's entrapment. He's admitted randomly that he bullies me, but I have seriously never been so harassed. He'll randomly poke my boob in public or grope me, and then I usually yell and tell him to quit it. All these behaviors are starting to get on my nerves because I find it really disrespectful. \n\nBefore we started dating and three months afterwards, I didn't realize he played video games. Now, it seems that is all he does, and ONLY talks about the games. It's as if he's regressed a whole decade. Also, whenever we get in a disagreement he'll passively aggressively put trash in my bag as a recompense which I find odd and annoying. Then whenever he does these things and I snap at him, he says I overreact and never apologizes. Instead thinking I was in the wrong for getting annoyed for these actions, and he'll leave me behind wherever we are (I'm writing this as we're at the airport to Costa Rica). We are on our way to my friend's destination wedding and I'm embarrassed of introducing him to my friends. \n\nIs it normal for a 25 yo male to exhibit these behaviors? I have never previously dated anyone who acted like this. I think this is a whole new level of immature, but maybe I'm overreacting?\nTL;DR:"}

He's my philosophy professor and since the first day of class I have been mesmerized by his intelligence and his entire persona. The way he walks and talks and dresses and acts are all so beautiful to me. His voice, his eyes, he's the entire package physically PLUS he is so attractively intelligent and I've never felt such a connection to someone. He stares at me in class almost as much as I stare at him and he barely looks at any other girls. I give my verbal input as much as possible during class discussions and it looks like he just can't wait to hear what I have to say. I make all a's on my own so its not for a grade and I've never considered this type of relationship with a teacher before so there is no hidden motive. One day after class we were talking privately and to my surprise he asked for my number. He texted me a few days later asking me to meet him out and I did. We had great flirty convo all night and wound up going to his place so we could smoke some weed and relax with some music. I didn't expect it but we were on the couch and he kissed me and my sexual organs exploded. Seriously never been so fully into someone. I've always had a thing for older men so the age isn't a problem for me. So we made out. He's a great kisser. Took it to the bedroom after a while andnever had sex. Just got hot and heavy without getting in each others pants. It was magical. Stayed up all night talking and connecting and I left the next day. Class hasn't been awkward and we've had a couple more days like this but still no sex but it doesn't make me feel bad. Everything feels right and like it will all happen like it should. He's spoken about becoming exclusive in the future and I'm not sure what to think of it but my head isn't too clear and I can't really grasp an outside perspective on the situation because I'm so far on cloud 9.

The relationship has been great, aside from the occasional argument, until recently. \n\nA few days ago, I was hanging out with my girlfriend when she made an off-hand comment about something bad she'd done. She clearly felt guilty and didn't want to tell me, but I didn't let it go and eventually it came out that she'd kissed her friends at a party she went to a few weeks ago. This is essentially what she told me:\n\nIt was at a small party with a few of her close friends. They'd been drinking, and eventually started playing spin the bottle. She joined in (she told me that she didn't really want to, but everyone was playing so she went with it). She made out with a few of them, and nothing else happened.\n\nI told her that I felt that even kissing is like cheating to me, but she didn't think it was a big deal. I mentioned that she shouldn't have joined in even though everyone else had, but she brushed that off. She also said that it was just her friends and \"it's not like it was another man\" but she's bi so the gender doesn't really matter, right? I eventually just gave up and ended the argument, but it still doesn't feel resolved.\n\nAfter talking it through she did apologise and tried to make it OK but I still don't think that she really agrees that what she did was wrong.\n\nI still don't know what to think about this. We talked it through but I still feel betrayed. So my question is basically: Is kissing like a 'lower' form of cheating? I'm just not sure if I'm making the right decision by forgiving her and ending the argument.\nTL;DR:"}

I was furious at first and didn't care to be her friend anymore. She then gave me a long and sincere apology for treating me that way, and we were on good terms a few days after us breaking up. We've then gone on to get drunk and hook up a few times since then, which has made the situation even more confusing. She tells me she still loves me and believes I'm the one, but she doesn't want to feel tied down and responsible to me as a girlfriend.

I'll start...\nPOST: So I was 16 and over my girlfriend's house just hanging out.  Her parents were out and only her younger brother was home.  Eventually we decided we wanted to vacate the living room downstairs and move up to a bedroom with a TV and DVD player to watch a movie (Breakfast Club...personal Top 5 favorite for me).  Only problem was, the only bedroom with a TV and DVD was her parent's room, so we slipped into their bed and through the movie on.  \nMovie ends, and we start sucking face (remember, I was 16.  Had it been today, the ol' \"watch movie in bed\" move basically means getting down to business shortly after the opening credits...these were more awkward times).  Trying not to catch a glimpse of her parents picture on the night stand next to the bed, we eventually strip naked are about to do the deed. Note: Both of us are virgins - here I have my girlfriend in her parent's bed, naked, and ready to give her virginity up. \nJust as I'm about hand in my V card, we here the front door open downstairs.  A few voices are chatting below us in the living room, and we realize that its her parents talking to her brother.  Mind you, we weren't allowed to even be upstairs in the first place...never mind ass naked in her parents room.\nShitting bricks I try to find every article of clothing I can and run into the upstairs bathroom.  She scrambles and hastily makes their bed and runs downstairs.  Thinking on my feet, I flush the toilet before I leave the bathroom and head downstairs.  Without us conspiring, my girlfriend had told her parents there wasn't any toilet paper in the downstairs bathroom and that I had to use the upstairs bathroom instead.  The amazing part? There actually wasn't any toilet paper left downstairs and they bought the entire thing.  So, again I ask, what was your closest call??\nTL;DR:"}

He's been my best friend for about half that time, we tell each other everything and he knows me better than some people I had been friends with for all of my secondary school years. We've been there for each other through really tough situations and he's great fun to be around in general.\n\nThen about two months ago something changed. What had been a completely non-sexual relationship before turned into sexting, and eventually we began to have sex in real life. However, we figured out pretty quickly that there wasn't the right kind of chemistry between us and a month ago mutually decided to go back to being just friends, thankfully without any sense of awkwardness. \n\nWhich brings us to today. I was texting him about a date I had last night (a normal enough topic for us, before things turned sexual two months ago we always talked about guys/girls we were seeing, he had gotten with a few girls since we ended things but this was my first date since then). Conor's first response was \"did he do (insert sexual act I had enjoyed back when we had sex)?\", and then he went on to send me the kind of message he would have sent to start things off back when we sexted each other. I called him out on it, and he responded that he just wanted to see if it would still work on me, which I'm not sure that I buy but it's still a pretty messed up thing to do if it's true.\n\nSo basically, what the heck do I do here? I value Conor's friendship, but this really made me uncomfortable. He knows himself that a sexual relationship wasn't going to work between us, and yet first date I have since then and he's bringing all that up again.\nTL;DR:"}

She's the first person with whom I haven't been scared to think of \"bigger picture\" stuff i.e. long term goals, marriage, kids, etc - all things I eventually want in life. We've talked about moving in together, abstractly talked about being together \"years from now,\" even hinted at marriage. However, she's talked (almost jokingly at times) about not wanting kids, and I've always shrugged it off and not thought much of it. Tired of dancing around it, I asked her point blank, and she flat out told me she did not want children.\n\nThere's part of me that says I'm too young not to be living for the moment and simply enjoying a relationship with a girl I'm madly in love with. But how can I do this with full knowledge that our long-term plans do not align on this one particularly important aspect?\n\nObviously I'm not the first person to ever have this issue. I guess what I'm wondering is...is it really just a question of what's more important to me - kids or her? Is there a deeper, more nuanced way of looking at it?\n\nHow do I handle this? Not wanting kids is an eventual dealbreaker for me, but am I too young to even have a dealbreaker like that?? I'm not comfortable waiting for her to have a \"maternal epiphany.\"\n\nWith all that in mind, saying that we're \"wasting time\" feels insulting to how close we are and the incredibly meaningful experiences we have together. Despite all this, I know that at some point I will have to reconcile this with her in some way. Anybody been here before?\nTL;DR:"}

We did make plans to meet up once, but then I had to cancel and we never ended up rescheduling - I guess neither of us was interested enough at the time to go through with it. And, I could tell by some of his facebook posts that he had probably started seeing someone as she was in a lot of his pics over a few weeks.

But, this past Saturday night, I ran into him at a bar and he was so cute! He knew who I was right away, and my name. And we chatted for just a couple minutes and said nice to meet you, etc. I recall him putting his hand on the small of my back at one point. Anyway - now I'm sad we never met and would like to see him again if at all possible. I still have his number in my phone - do you think I should text him, and if so, saying what?

After the blow from that, I failed a semester due to complete lack of motivation. I was also dealing with some personal heartbreak at this time; I had no idea what to do next and was dealing with my depression worsening. My GPA took a blow, but it is still within the 3.0 range. The only positive is that my scholarships covered my tuition, and I accrued no debt during this time.\n\nI did not apply for another semester, I moved out of the dorms, and started living in an apartment while working full-time to support myself. I really enjoy my job, and I make above minimum wage, but my monthly income is not enough to support myself and sustain adequate savings.\n\nUnfortunately, my roommate situation did not work out (read: my SO and I did not work out, more ouch) and living in the apartment became out of my means, so I had to move back home. I am now working my full-time job as well as a part-time job to build up some kind of a savings and distract myself from what feels like a downward spiral. With the direction I'm going I feel unfulfilled, and quite honestly like a failure.\n\nI want to go back to college, I am interested in an engineering program that this college offers and it's a field I believe I would enjoy, but I am so afraid of crashing and burning again. I want more than anything to be able to support myself, but I am so confused as to whether I am doing the right thing. \n\nAnother option, since I basically hate my life here, is to do what I've been dreaming of--I want to move out to Colorado where my sister lives, because I feel like being in a new place would really improve my quality of life and make me feel like not such an asshole for forever circling the drain in my hometown, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to do this, and I know tuition there would be staggering as an out-of-state student.\nTL;DR:"}

I usually don't eat dinner, especially not sweet stuff but hey, who can say no to mommas pancakes.\n\nSuddenly one of my mum's friends dropped by to pick up some stuff she borrowed her. She was carrying heavy grocery bags and even though she doesn't live far away my mum insisted I give her a ride home. So of course I did.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: We have to drive by our local park and I saw a few dudes chilling there with some female friends. Now I usually carry glasses, and wasn't really paying attention, because, you know, driving, but I was pretty sure one of those girls was the one I really really like. So when I came back home I knew I had to check out if she really was there, but because I wasn't good friends with those guys I couldn't approach them directly. Only one logical thing to do here.\n\nThere is a road that goes behind my house, through the fields, through some woods, over a small hill and ends up on the other side of that park. So I put on my shoes, took my dog, his leash and ran 4 four frikkin miles (6-7 kilometers) just to check out if my crush was in the park.

I couldn't figure out where all my other content should be and I started frantically searching the website for answers.  Well I'm not sure if it was me being high or because it was late at night, but I thought \"I must just not be getting something, I'll check it again in the morning.\"  I woke up this morning and started talking to my roommate about it.  After talking about it, I realized what had happened.  I had bought four versions of the game hence the \"Four Pack.\"  It was not four of the DLC packs, it was four versions of the game I'm assuming to give to friends as gifts.  So I paid four four copies of the exact same game.  Thank god I waited until it was on 80% off so I only spent $18, I feel like a moron all the same.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: Do these people sound like real friends to you?\nPOST: I have a few people in my life (I prefer not to call them \"friends\", because I don't see them as such). These three people are very close, almost as if they are family. This is fine, everyone has their best friends. However, these people (2 girls, 1 guy) seem to go out of their way to make sure they exclude everyone else from their lives. It is the three of them first, everyone else second. About a year ago, I brought this up to one of the three people (a person who i have known for 15 years, someone I believed i could trust). I said that I felt neglected as a friend because on the surface their gestures would seem nice and cordial, but once you are around them they made no effort to include me or anyone else they were with at whatever social gathering there was. I was immediately shunned from their little group after I spoke my mind because I apparently offended them. Anyway, a few weeks later, I would apologize and we sort of make up, I swallow my pride and admit I may have overreacted. Still, I am wary of being with them because of the way that they exclude people and act like children. About a year later (present day), other friends of mine--friends who have always had my back and been there for me (who were also well acquainted with the three) have a very similar issue. They had a fight over practically nothing. The three friends who act immature now have practically nobody except themselves. This puts me in an awkward position. I don't particularly like these three people, but they did not do anything to wrong me and will still occasionally invite me out (as if nothing happened) to social gatherings and such. I don't know what is the right way to feel about this, considering that they have wronged me in the past and that they now have behaved in a similarly immature way towards close friends of mine. This isn't really an urgent issue, just wondering if anyone else has input or a similar issue in their social lives.\nTL;DR:"}

We have been spending fewer nights together and I feel preoccupied with school so I never feel like I am fully \"present.\" She has said this as well. I like her a lot, but I don't feel like my feelings are growing at all since I started school and I have had some doubts lately. I also feel like we have different ideas about how we like to spend our time (I am a serious student, her less so.

He has a reputation of being a 'player' and hooking up with girls at parties and all that. I'm pretty much the opposite of him. But I humored him and we had quite a lengthy conversation and I was surprised to find that he wasn't as bad as I presumed him to be.\n\nI understand that he is probably just hamming it up for my sake. I tried to make it clear to him that I don't buy is charming charade but he just turned to humor and sadly won me over. \n\nAfter constant nagging and provoking on his part, I finally agreed to spend one day to get to know him in person. He insists that I'll like him.\n\nI'm still not sure if this is a good idea, as I could be very easily manipulated. But he was being perfectly kind and polite, so I don't want to be rude. \n\nHow can I get the point across that I do not intend on being another notch on his bed post? A friend of mine who knows him tells me that refusing him will only make him try harder.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to make him understand I don't want random sex?

It was a fairly quiet day so I wasn't really prepared for anything, when a little girl starts walking slowly near the backpacks. She slowly looks at the backpacks and since its a little girl I just let her look at them without too much care.\nAll of a sudden the girl just grabs a backpack with wheels and just runs off.\n\nNow, I'm alone in the stall so I can't leave and chase after her, I try shouting to the girl and asking people to stop her but when people started noticing, she's gone.\n\nAs we get to the end of the shift I keep thinking how the fuck do I explain this to my boss, I don't think he's gonna believe a little girl just took a backpack and ran off.

For the record, I consider myself bisexual, so there's not a lot of issues there. \n\n- I've been married to a woman (Let's call her Katelyn) for 3 years. We had a baby who died a few days after birth due to medical issues last year. We haven't tried for another. It's never been the perfect marriage, but after our son died, it's become something I could live with into a waking nightmare. We live pretty much separate lives at this point and barely speak anymore. \n\n- My best friend in the entire world (Sam) is gay male. Handsome, perfect features, easy going, fun to hang out with and literally the best human being in the world. Like, when I was rushed to the hospital a while back, the first person there was him. Not my wife. We've known each other since high school, and there's always been a mutual attraction there. We flirt hardcore, make dirty jokes about each other, but have never crossed the line. I kind of missed my chance with him due to being seriously in the closet about my bisexuality at the time.\n\n- He has a boyfriend. I hate his boyfriend, both to clashing personalities, jealousy, and him being a fat redneck asshole who goes on drinking binges the moment anything goes wrong in his life. He doesn't know I dig his boyfriend. If he did know, the subsequent drinking and beating the shit out of me would have happened already. He deserves so much better than a drunken asshole like him.\nTL;DR:"}

I am still paying for it now and still owe a little over $3000 on it. Couldn't refinance it because it is below refinancing minimum amount ($4K). Sell price according the KBB for it is estimated at $1500 - $2K, well below how much I still owe for it. \n\nA few days ago, wheel came loose while I was driving down the road. I had it repaired and it cost me $600 (it hasn't been a good week for me lately. Sigh.). I have a kid and I worry driving that car now with my kid in it. So I thought about just trading it in. \n\nNow, I have a good credit score (730 last I checked this month). If I trade it in, my understanding is I will be in an upside down.

I'm (male) 24, she's 21. Started dating nearly 2 years ago. I would say things went fine for the first year, no glaring problems. Within the past year, though, we've been arguing more and more regularly. We live 30 minutes apart, and generally see eachother Friday through Sunday. During the week, she'll tell me how she misses me so much, and how it's so hard to be apart, yet when we finally get to be with eachother on the weekends, it seems like someone will do something that makes eachother pissed, inevitably leading to arguments and frustrations. By the end of the weekend, many times I'll be glad to finally be alone, ready to recharge my batteries before the next weekend of potential drama.\n\nI don't know if I need to get into specifics on what the arguments are about, unless anyone would like to do or if it's relevant to the issues at hand. I would say it's about 50/50, whether it's me getting pissed at her for doing something or her getting pissed at me for something. But basically, it's gotten to the point where, even though we feel like we have a very close bond in many ways and feel so used to being with eachother every weekend, it's frustrating to see us go down the same path of arguing, practically every weekend now.\n\nWe're both in a pretty depressed state, personally, for many reasons, but I feel like it makes me feel like it would just be easier for us to stick together, despite the flaws, since it could be worse being alone. I don't know if this flawed logic though. I do know that, unfortunately, she would be more devastated if we broke up than I would (reason being I'm her first bf, whereas she's my 3rd gf so I've dealt with breaking up before). I'd like to get some opinions from the reddit community on what we should do here. Is it worthwhile to take some time off? Anyone whose had similar experiences getting out of or fixing relationships with constant arguments are drama? Thanks.\nTL;DR:"}

His ex hates me probably due to the fact she isn't over him yet. A few weeks ago they started talking and were planning to meet up over email (she wanted to visit him while he had his wisdom teeth out and see his family) That day she attacked me over his computer and when I called him to figure out what was going on, she was yelling at me in the background telling me to go to hell and whatnot. My boyfriend, being dazed on painkillers I guess wasn't thinking about it but he kicked her out when I told him to. I've told him countless times shes a negative person who is fucking with his past emotions to try and get him back and various others have talked to him about it as well. I find out she is now on his steam too and it makes me sick to my stomach even thinking about all of this. I have been having anxiety attacks over it.\n\nBasically: I love the kid. He's going through some rough times with his depression right now (he's on his medication, he just finds this time of year to be troubling for him) But I just can't handle the fact he's talking to her again and I'm getting these anxiety attacks over it. When I talk to him, he says they are just friends and I need to calm down. Normally I'd be fine with being friends with exs but she is just completely crazy and is clearly not over him yet. I can't handle not being in control over this situation.\n\nWhat I am thinking of doing right now is backing off a bit because I basically live at his house.

Last week my parents weren't home so I decided to invite my girlfriend over to hangout and what not. We were watching tv and we got hungry so we decided to go make something to eat. I looked around the kitchen for something to eat and a brand new jar of Nutella sat right there in the middle of the snack shelf. Never did I think such a harmless, chocolatey snack could cause me so much trouble. So, I grabbed the Nutella and started making sandwiches for her and me. We finished the sandwiches and started making out. One thing led to another and my girlfriend began blowing me. I guess she was just incredibly kinky that day because the next thing she said was, \"I want more Nutella\". I was confused at first, but a couple moments later I understood what she meant. Now, any normal guy (I use the term normal lightly) would had just spread the Nutella on his dick but I had the great idea of just sticking it in the jar. My girlfriend continues with my new chocolate treat and the blowjob is great. I realize my parents are coming home soon so my girlfriend leaves, but she takes the Nutella home with her. I don't like Nutella, nor does anyone in my family so I don't know why it was in my house. Fast forward to the next day and I get a text from my girlfriend that makes me sick to my stomach. She told me that her parents were having Nutella sandwiches for lunch. Yes, with the same jar of Nutella I stuck my junk in. Her parents were eating my dick contaminated Nutella. I feel like I have violated them every time I see them now and I don't know how I'll ever get over this. Better yet, I decided to tell one of my friends about the whole situation and he found it so funny that he told more people. Those people told more people and now the whole school is talking about it and calling me \"Nutella Dick\" and the word \"Nutella\" is brought up in every other sentence that someone says to me.\nTL;DR:"}

Being homeschooled didn't allow me to socialize much, except with my family and my mother's female friends when she would go out to lunch and socialize.\n\nThis leads me to today. I have caught up a lot on socialization with my own age group, and am now married to a wonderful woman. However, I find that I enjoy socializing more with women and would prefer to have female friends. This doesn't click for most people, because \"You're straight, you must have ulterior motives.\" So that's my struggle, and I'm looking for some advice or a kind word. I know I can't be alone in this, but it sure feels like it. Thanks for reading.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My [26M] girlfriend [28F] of six months is leaving.\nPOST: I have been with my current girlfriend for six months. Everything has been great, neither of us have complaints about the relationship. When I met her initially, she moved here for school. She has been out of school for two months now. She told me her initial plans were to come here for school, then continue on (ie. move somewhere else) with whatever she planned on doing. But she met me, so she decided to stay.\n\nSuddenly tonight, she texted me telling she has decided that she is moving away. I phoned her and we talked and this is what she told me: At the moment, she does not have a great deal going on here. It is in her best interests to move to a larger city and continue on with her career. She said can't stay here and put her life on hold for me. She needs to move and work on her career. I then asked what that meant for us, and she said she didn't know.\n\nShe asked me to put myself in her shoes. I told her I understand where she is coming from, but I wouldn't just drop her like that. I would at least consider her as we are in a relationship.\n\nThe thing is, I have been wanting to move out of my city as well, but it's taking me quite a while to find a job somewhere else. I have been wanting to move out of the city as long as I've known her and she was on board with moving. She just isn't willing to wait anymore and wants to move to work on herself/career.\n\nShe recently asked me if she could move in with me. I told her I wasn't ready. I think this may contribute to her decision to leave because she doesn't view us as a serious couple.\n\nI am shocked because it seems like the relationship has taken a sudden twist. At the moment I'm not sure what to do. I think giving her space is a good idea.\nTL;DR:"}

It's just something fun on the side\u2014a fun tweet here, another there. It's honestly not something I've ever given much thought to; I don't spend particularly a lot of time on it (only ~3,000 tweets over 5 years, which compared to many users, is not much). \n\nMy girlfriend of 17 months, however, has really hated it. She always reads too far into my tweets and asks why I'm talking to these people or why I'm sharing these details about my life (I don't really go too personal in my tweets\u2014just maybe interesting observations and mostly athlete retweets). She insists that I spend way too much time tweeting instead of focusing on her. \n\nThis is a little saddening; I just checked my cell phone usage bill and I had ~6000 texts back-and-forth\u2014a majority with her. So basically, in a month, I more than doubled my tweets with my texts.\n\nShe now is telling me to either tweet only 2-3 days a week, which I find to be slightly upsetting. She keeps on trying to guilt me by saying I would rather choose Twitter over her, but that isn't the case. I really do love her, but I'm deeply disturbed that she is willing to take something enjoyable and harmless away from me because it makes her uncomfortable. \n\nMaybe it is selfish of me. But I'm scared that even if I do delete my twitter or even tweet only 2-3 days a week, this behavior may continue. She has forcibly deleted some facebook friends of mine before and even deleted my account twice. \n\nThis is such a stupid 21st century problem. She doesn't use FB or Twitter; I've tried talked to her about it, but she won't budge. 2-3 days a week or nothing.\n\nA little more backstory: We are in a college LDR, 360 miles (6 hour drive) away from each other. Communication is thus through phone/text/Skype, which further complicates things...\n\nWhat should I do?\nTL;DR:"}

While I never had her for class, I was assigned to her as part of her group.  Before this meeting I had with her, I never actually sat in her office and had a lengthy discussion with her about anything.\n\nI had a bit of a conundrum concerning which classes I needed to take to fulfill the number of credits I needed to graduate, so I went to her for help.

This professor looked to be in her late 40's or 50's, so I immediately assumed they were her grandkids.  With a smile, I happily said, \"Professor SoandSo, I just wanted to say you have some adorable-looking grandkids.\"\n\nI realized I royally fucked up when her jovial-looking smile disappeared and a look of consternation crossed her face she replied, \"SLProtoman, those are actually MY kids...not grandchildren.\"\n\nI must've turned such a bright shade of red that I could put Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer out of a fucking job, because I felt my face become flushed with my embarassment and the wind blowing past my ears.

He tells me all these details about them, like their names, where they went to school, how they know each other, etc, and i never really ask for any of this info, it's just how the bf talks. Anyway, he told me he had brunch plans with a \"friend\" today. Apparently, his friend is visiting from DC for a public health conference, and he knows her from college. The weird part was that when I asked him who this friend is, he just said \"oh, just a friend from college\". No name, no inane details, nothing. This is very atypical for him. I am 99% sure it's his ex, who he has said he was going to marry at one point. What happened between them is unclear to me, and I don't really feel comfortable asking. The couple time he has mentioned it, the story has been different. I'm pretty sure it's her because she's his only friend who would be in town from DC for a public health conference, that plus his dodginess. He never talks about her, ever. He talks about other exes when it's relevant, but never this one. I don't care that they are in touch or are friends, it's the shadiness that bothers me....a lot. Furthermore, I know she still sends him cutsie messages (that is a whole different story I'm not getting into), so I don't know what that's about.

Usually it's a misunderstanding, but she seems to default to being offended before knowing everything that has happened and needs to sulk a bit before being ready to talk about it.\n\nEven though I would rather her not sweat the small stuff, she brought up a good point: little things add up over time so it may be better that she expresses her feelings now so I understand.

That there is even a picture of us on her profile.\n\n I don't know the extent of the activity, but just hearing it is alarming. We never discussed the details of the break, but I figured we were going on the principle of still wanting to be together, but taking a step back for a bit, and not seeing any one else.

There are still pictures of us in her albums, etc. I can't see any physical evidence of her starting to remove me from her life.\n\nAny advice?

Once I legitimately wrote a pretty good college paper while drunk as fuck at 4am, and it was completely without typos.\n\nAnyway, I came home, and immediately got on the computer. I had been eyeing some stuff on Amazon earlier that day, so Zoom that's where I go. I bought like five novelty items for my desk, A tiny little catapult, a Tyrion figurine, etc. One of the items was a cool little glass prism that looks kind of neat when people walk by because it refracts light. Nice.\n\nSo apparently, and I still haven't figured out how I did this, I somehow accidentally hit 44 on the quantity. \n\nI immediately contacted Amazon, but it's from a private seller, and I couldn't contact them. It already shipped out. I'm getting 44 prisms I guess. There were about 7 bucks a pop, so it ended up being around 400 bucks with my other purchases.\nTL;DR:"}

It really hurt to look at, though I know there was probably nothing to it. \n\nHe untagged it, and he talked to her about and she said oh well, it was innocent. She also untagged it.\n\nHe apologised about it and said it really was nothing, just a hug. There's nothing between them etc. She has a boyfriend of 3 years that she wants to marry. \n\nI believe him but I'm so insecure and it's making me so jealous, and I think I'm driving him mad. Every time I see him texting her it upsets me. I'm trying to get over it and I'm managing to hide my jealousy better but it's still there. It's driving me nuts. I don't want to be a crazy jealous girlfriend, and I want my boyfriend to feel okay about having female friends. \n\nHow can I get over this? I know it's probably more to do with my own insecurities and I know I need to work on them but I don't know HOW. I've tried counselling and CBT and didn't like it at all.\nTL;DR:"}

When I first moved in with her, we agreed to doing certain jobs. I'd heard rumours about how messy this girl was, so I volunteered to vacuum and sweep the whole house if she made sure that she took the rubbish out whenever it was full. For the first week or two, she stuck to it, and there wasn't an issue. But after that? Whew, she never did it once. It would build up and build up, until there was four or five bags sitting around the bin, and then I would take it out myself, because the smell became unbearable. \n\nTwo months in, I tell her that I'm moving back home to save up some money. It's a lie, and she knows it, but hey, what's it matter? I also tell her that I'm going away for the weekend a few days before I leave. So that Friday, I'm ready to leave, and I see that there is a rubbish bag tied up next to the bin, and a half full bag in a bin. I shake my head and leave. \n\nFast forward a few days and I come home to six rubbish bags, and my house mate isn't there. I text her to find out that she won't be home for the rest of the following week. \n\nIdea time. I cut holes in all the bags, and hide them around the apartment. I put one in a suitcase that she stored in my room. I put a couple under the washing machine, because it has a gap in its back. And I put another in the cupboard under the sink in the kitchen too, because I also know she'd never do the dishes. \n\nIt's been almost a year, and my old room mate has left the house, and it still hasn't been leased out to someone. Pretty sure she lost her bond too.\nTL;DR:"}

She's my closest friend and we have a relationship I'm entirely comfortable with; we keep each other busy, have an active sex life, etc.  The idea of spending my life with her isn't as far fetched as it may have seemed only a few months ago.  We live together, have a pet...and my life is markedly better now than it was before we were together.  \n\nThere is, however, one hangup; she is my only sexual partner, and I'm worried as to what this could do to our future relationship.  The This American Life story detailed how two 30 year olds that had been dating for 10+ years decided to try a \"sexual exploration\" separation as a test to their relationship, ultimately ending in their breakup.  I don't want to break up with my girlfriend, but this is an issue that's been gnawing at me for a while now and I feel it's something I need to address.  What would be the proper way of doing this?  Or am I just suffering from the idea of greener grass somewhere else?\n\nAs a sidenote, she doesn't know that I was a virgin before we started dating.\nTL;DR:"}

Was very nice to me and everyone else that was there. I thought he was pretty great and we clicked really well. I didn't think I'd see him again though so I didn't really think too much about it.\n\nThe next day, \"Ben\" adds me on Facebook along with everyone else in the group that he met. We talk here and there about random things. He kind of takes a long time to answer, but whenever he does, he sounds interested in talking and makes good conversation. He never just leaves the convo with a short reply. Either asks a question or gives me something to respond back to. A few times he said how crazy it was that we had so many things in common. We probably send each other 10 or so messages a day. No more than that.\n\nDuring one conversation we were talking about local pubs and he said \"yeah, a lot of kids hang out there\". That kind of stung. I was starting to really like him, but I guess he would see me as a kid because of my age. At the same time, I don't want to assume he would never be interested in me just because of that. How can I tell if he would be interested? \n\nI'm just not sure how to approach this situation. If I have no chance with him, which I probably don't, then I just kind of want to stop talking as much or at least stop hoping he will message me. That way, he won't be in my mind and I won't be looking for his messages. I don't want to ask any mutual friends just yet. That would be really embarrassing.\nTL;DR:"}

Is this normal?\nPOST: Whenever we argue, my boyfriend will refuse to talk to me until he's calmed down.  This usually takes a couple of days and is distressing to me.  Although I admit that I am calmer about the issue too by that point, I feel confident that I could discuss it in reasonable manner and sort it out sooner.  I asked him about it once and he said that he needs that time to calm down and that otherwise he's afraid that he would say things he would regret.  I respect that but at the same time it's hurtful to me each time to be ignored and pushed away.  We've been together about a year and otherwise the relationship good.\n\nSo my question is, is this normal behaviour?  My exes pretty much all did it too.  I had assumed that it was something I just had to put up with in relationships, but I'm starting to question that, especially given how upsetting I find it.  It's like each time we argue I have to deal with my bad feelings over the argument AND my hurt from him ignoring me.\nTL;DR:"}

I was dropped off to go to go to an internship which I was too early to(about 20 minutes) and the person who I was going to meet has not arrived at the office yet so I had to wait out back in the alley for him to arrive. I had woken up nearly an hour before, I had not enough to time to shower. I had a feeling I looked a little off, I wanted use my phone as a mirror but mistakenly forgot it at home. After about 10 minutes of sitting like a bum in the alley, I decided to use a tinted car window as a mirror. I walked up to the car thinking no one would care and started to look at myslef. But what is with my eyebrow? It was sticking out very weirdly. I began to try to put it down but it would just stick right up, so I started licking my finger a little bit to get it to stay down but I could not. After about 3 minutes of trying to get my eyebrow down, licking my fingers and touching my face I hear a loud voice,\"what the hell are you doing\"! I look and see a woman coming back the car I which I was at looking at me like I just killed someone. Then I notice it, when I looked back to the window past my reflection, I saw there was very young boy(probably 6 or so by himslef) in the back seat on the other side of the window with the most terrified face ever. The whole time I was trying to fix my brow this child and anyone around me thought I was staring at him like some kind of maniac. I tried to explain what I was doing to the mother, but she began to threaten to call the police so I got out of there quick as possible, probably didn't help that I was hanging out in the alley before that.\nTL;DR:"}

Whenever I admit I'm worried, it seems to upset him and he just says \"there's nothing to worry about\" and \"I'm not worried\" over and over. It makes me feel worse, like I'm stupid for worrying, like he doesn't care. Because to me, I worry because I care. I care about him and our future. This is very important to me.

I refused to go bringing up the point that I'm atheist (her parents think I'm Christian) and don't want to be preached to about a deity I don't believe in. When she protested saying she just wanted my company, I told her that I have never made her sit through a lecture by an atheist, in a group of atheists, bashing religion and those who follow one. We have had conversations sharing our views but have not tried to make the other follow/practice each other's beliefs/disbeliefs (spellcheck). After the conversation she was obviously irritated that I refused and said I was being very difficult, almost as if my refusal was unreasonable. What are your thoughts Reddit?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I'm a [26 M] attending University, should I try and talk to/date girls much younger than I am?\nPOST: Hey, I'm in probably my 3rd year of College after taking a long break after I finished HS. I went back to get my shit together. So here's my problem, since I'm quite a bit older than everyone here I don't know if I should even TRY and pursue a relationship. I guess 18-20 year old girls might still be too young, but ideally 21+ would be the target range. However, it's not like I can pinpoint all girl's ages simply by looking right? There's not really any other way for me to meet people, especially at my age and at the same point in their lives.\n\nI guess the it's kind of a mixture of a few problems; A) Should I try and talk to girls with the pursuit of a relationship in mind? B) Should I feel weird trying to get girls that much younger? and C) How big of a factor would my age be? I'm aware that it's on a per-person basis but I don't know... does anyone happen to have been in or seen someone in a similar situation? \n\nSince my semester has started not too long ago, I haven't really had a chance I guess to try and talk to any girls especially with the nature of the classes (STEM, etc.) I'd LIKE to be in a relationship especially considering it's been so long since I last dated which was high school. That reason being that from the period after I graduated high school til I started college again I was huge (280 pounds at one point) and I had pretty low confidence. Now I've lost that weight and shredded up (185 atm). I'm decent looking, decent height, and pretty fit. I've always been a little bit introverted and I still retain a bit of those self-confidence issues from when I was heavy. So yeah... I don't know. Should I bother trying to date in college at my age? Or should I find some alternative?\nTL;DR:"}

Anyone care to weigh in?\nPOST: So I met this girl on Okcupid a month or two ago. We messaged back and forth a few times. I am currently and temporarily living in a different city than her, but I normally live in her city (special circumstances, I am moving home soon). Anyway, we got coffee once and I didn't think much of it. Conversation was polite and kind of interesting but that's about it. We said the customary \"that was fun, let's do it again sometime\" text after, but I did not expect to hear from her again.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she starts texting me again. She wants to hang out. So I go to her place, we smoke weed, watch some cheesy 80's movies and have sex. I think it was pretty good sex, but I may have just been high.\n\nAnyway, I end up leaving that night after some cuddling and a kiss goodbye. She texted me the day after or so and I texted her the day after that but radio silence since then. She did say she want's to hang out when I'm back in town again.\n\nSo I'm wondering if this was just a hookup or does she want something more? I rarely do hookups so this is new territory to me. Part of me thinks she just wanted sex and that's it. But on the other hand, I wonder if she want's something more. She is a very attractive woman and would have no trouble getting sex, so I don't see why she would wait so long for just sex- and her profile did say she was looking for a relationship. \n\nI guess I just want some other opinions. Like I said, this is not usually my style so I am in new territory. If I try to contact her too much I could seem needy/clingy but if I don't I could seem like an asshole who only wanted to pump and dump. I don't even know what I want from her, I just hate the uncertainty. So if people who hook up more could weigh in, I would love some context.\nTL;DR:"}

I could raelly use some advice\nPOST: First of all, sorry for my English (it's not my native language)\n\nSo, here's the story. Me and my girl are together for 9 years. At first we were in a distance relationship (for about 3 years). Then we moved in together and everything was fine. However, due to economic problems (long-term unemployment and poverty) we had to move in with her parents. Now, her parents are super cool and reasonable and did their best for me to feel like home. \n\nNow therein lies the problem. Living with her parents made me too embarrassed to want to have sex with her while her parents are at home which (since they both are retired) was all the time. They never left home hence we couldn't be intimate.\n My SO wanted to have sex with me but I just couldn't operate with her parents moving around the house. Also we could not afford to go to a hotel or something, so sex and intimacy became rare. \n\nFinally, a couple of months ago we did find some time and privacy and had sex. But because we had a really long time to have sex she told me that it felt that she was having sex with a friend. The absence of intimacy and sexy time lead her to fall out of love with me and now she is not sexually attracted to me anymore. She doesn't want to break up with me because she still loves me and can't live with out me (sic) and neither do I. I just want to win her back. I want to make her to fall in love with me all over again and I want to make her to be sexually attracted to me again. I could really use some advice.\nTL;DR:"}

I obviously knew when entering the field that I would be one of few females in my department, and I am comfortable with that idea. I've always been great at making friends with guys, because I've always been a girl in a man's world (cuz, y'know.. IT and stuff).\n\nI've become pretty close with these two guys that I work with. At first, I didn't mind being considered \"one of the guys,\" because this typically happens to me. I'm very laidback, and I do have some noticeable masculine energy (again, largely due to my field of study). Unfortunately, the relationship has turned from \"bro status\" to the two guys constantly calling me masculine and \"butch.\"\n\nI initially tried to laugh it off. When that didn't work, I tried acting a little more feminine (how I typically would act around female friends); when I did this, they mocked me and didn't take anything that I said seriously.\n\nThey don't intend anything that they are saying to be hurtful. I realize it's just friendly teasing, but it's at the point where I'm really feeling unhappy about our friendship.

Baggings routine to me now and I hardly ever mess things up. Occasionally an angry old woman will yell at me for packing a bag over 3 pounds but other than that nothing too stressful. However today, a customer came through the line with his 4-6 year old little girl. One of the items he was buying was, of course, a rotisserie chicken. \n\nNormally I grab the chicken like an normal person would and put it in its respected bag, but today I was bored and decided to be cool and toss the chicken from my left to right hand so I can have a smooth transition to bag it. As I tossed I felt the cardboard sheath which protects the chicken slowly slide off. For once my right hand let me down and as I tossed it, the plastic container opened allowing the chicken freedom. I pretty much sent this chicken into its Olympic Gymnastics career as it Mc-twisted its ass through the air - sending nasty burning hot chicken grease everyone - smacked the little girl in the stomach, and stuck its landing. I muttered out what probably didn't sound like an apology and rushed to clean up the mess I made. The chicken sat there in the splits like it just beat Gabby Douglas to win the gold. I cleaned as much as I could while spitting apologies at the little girl and her father. After 15 minutes of the dad cleaning the grease from her daughter's shirt they finally left. I just found out that although he wasn't doing an evaluation the customer was actually part of corporate. I'm sitting at home hoping that I keep my job after that fuck up.\nTL;DR:"}

Hooking up with \"Jess\" was easy, meaningless, and insignificant to me. This wasn't the case for her, and we've since had a falling out based on a misunderstanding of expectations going into that scenario. That all said and done, Jess is  still in the same department as me at work, and I still see/interact with her from time to time, albeit as little as possible. \n\nFast-forward to last month, and I've started seeing a really nice, sweet girl that we'll call Jordan, that works in my building, but not in my department. Things are looking to be somewhat serious, we've gone out a bunch of times since then and it really feels great, I'm planning on formally asking her to be my girlfriend soon. However, my conscience tells me that this incident with Jess is something that should definitely not be kept from Jordan. I think it's important that there not be secrets like that kept from someone you trust intimately. \n\nThe problem is, I don't know how soon is too soon to tell her, I wouldn't want her to become spooked, or see me in a bad light because of that decision.

I'd like to think we've become good friends this summer.\n\nHowever, I'd like to become more than friends.  I haven't felt this way about anyone since high school.  The problem is that we live a good hour and half from each other (the internship is in a city between us). That's not a huge deal for me at least cuz I can drive and hour and a half no problem.  Where the real problem comes in is that she dorms at a college that would make it a four hour distance between us.\n\nI can almost assume that this distance would be too long for a romantic relationship but I guess you never know.  I just don't want to wonder for the rest of my life what would have happened if I went for it.  \n\nOn the other hand, I still think she's a cool person and would want to try and stay friends outside of the internship.

I want to have some more partners and not another long term relationship for another say 10 years. I like being by myself which is another thing, sometimes I get annoyed when I dont get time to myself. I have actually been enjoying my time to myself while she has been away.\n\nSo she is back in a month and sure I can't stay in this relationship, I don't want to end it while she is there as she will be devastated when If I do it and I don't want to ruin her trip. I want to know the best way to let her down gently. This has to happen as if I am having these feelings now, if I stay, how will I feel in 10 years let alone the rest of my life. I feel it is best to break up now rather than let it be even worse in the future. I know she will be sad but at the end of the day it is my feelings that matter to me and I know I won't be happy staying in the relationship. \n\nSo, what is the best way to explain this to her without her being too hurt?\nThanks\nTL;DR:"}

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a little over a year now and up until about lets say a month ago everything felt awesome. We are totally open with each other and always say whats on our mind.\n\nfor the past month, maybe more, though she stopped wanting to have sex, which i eventually learned was because she has an ED and because shes just not feeling very positive about the way she looks or anything. Ive always striven to tell her how amazing i think she looks and for the record shes smoking hot. So? okay im okay with abstaining from sex.\n\nShes also become distant emotionally and communication wise. Ill be lucky to get more than a text in an hour, when im with her in person shes always on the phone and seems to be dismissive of me whenever i speak, shell say things like \"that's cool\" or \"that's nice\" whenever i try to speak to her. This would be easy if it weren't for the fact that the reason shes always on her phone is because shes talking to other guys some who shes met off tinder. I should say that we both use tinder to meet and talk to people and up until now its never been a real problem. Ive talked to her about it and she says it validates her because of her self esteem issues. Ive talked to her about everything and pretty she pretty much explains that its due to her not being mentally healthy right now. Ive asked her if im doing anything wrong and i always get the im the perfect boyfriend you've literally never wronged me answer. \n\nI feel like she might be hiding something from me or maybe ive just become crazy and want to explain the mental health issues as something else. What do i even do i really need help and guidance. Its tearing me apart seeing her like this and its making me depressed because now i feel like i cant share my burdens or worries about anything including the way shes acting with her so i feel like i have no one to talk to.\nTL;DR:"}

We hear the sound of stilettos on hardwood floor at almost all times. Seems odd, maybe someone just likes her heels. Then the fucking begins. Fucking at all times above my room. And not regular fucking, this is some kinky ass, beads dropping, screaming, wtf fucking. \n\nI begin to suspect whores have taken up residence. Friends laugh at me and say go masturbate. I tell them, \"fuck you, come listen.\" They hear but still dismiss it saying, \"she's probably a freak.\" Fast forward six months and we're moving out. I tell them as I'm bringing boxes to the moving van, \"I gotta know. Going to apartment above us to find out.\" They roll their eyes. What happens next still blows my mind. \n\nThere's a doorbell but instead I knock. I heard the scurrying of feet to the door. Someone's looking at me through the peephole and I hear two people speaking in Mandarin. The door opens, \"come in,\" she says. Standing in front of me is an old asian lady that looks about the age of my grandma. She closes the door. *what the fuck have I got myself into*. Then I hear the stilettos. I turn to my left and I see her. She's wearing six inch heals, tits the size of melons, and an ass that wouldn't quit. She circles me with one finger and says, \"what do you want?\" My lips are quivering and my inner awkward penguin kicks in. I reply, \"I'm here to borrow scissors.\" The mama-san looks at me and says in a very calm voice, \"get out.\"\n\nRan downstairs and told my friends, \"A-HA! I KNEW IT! THERE WERE HOOKERS LIVING ABOVE US!\"\nTL;DR:"}

We tried dating our sophomore year, but it didn't work out too well. (I blame the fact that we were 15 and awkward) Well anyways now we are both halfway through our freshman year in college at different schools and my heart decides to fall for him. It could be the fact that we call one another weekly or just because we now have more in common than ever. I have friends who are breaking up with their long distance partners and I know it probably wouldn't be the best idea to start one up now, but I feel like this is holding me back from looking for other guys. Should I admit to him how I feel and see if it could go anywhere? If he says he doesn't feel the same way would it ruin what we have now or help me move on? I have no idea what I'm doing!\nTL;DR:"}

Every day he will post a story of a blacked out screen with typed words that say \"hmu for bud\" or something along those lines.\n\nI've talked to him about drugs and selling before... But he just doesn't care what I have to say. He is young and wants to be \"popular;\" he wants to be the one that people come to when they need something.\n\nSo this has only been going on for around 2 weeks, and as far as I can tell my parents are clueless. I will say... I have never witnessed him make a drug transaction, so I don't know to what extent this is happening. I have just seen the snap story.\n\nNeither of us (or our other brother) have been particularly close with our parents. They're the type to fly off the handle at absolutely anything. My younger brother told me that he asked to go to his girlfriends house a few months ago and my mom broke down crying and had an absolute fit, worrying, screaming, and carrying on about how he could be having sex. This is nothing out of the ordinary for her.\nSo do I tell them that he is probably selling drugs? I know that if I do tell them they will immediately drag him from whatever he is doing, and my mother will go into fits of rage and scream and belittle him. I do think that her doing this would deter him from selling drugs, but it will also destroy my relationship with my little brother. \n\nSo, should I tell my parents?

Should I reach out to her before it's too late or give her space?\nPOST: For some background, we're both college students at different universities about 20 minutes away that have been dating for 6 months. Recently my girlfriend has decided she wanted to break up. This happened last Friday. The Wednesday before she wasn't talking to me/responding to my texts at all and I knew something was wrong. On Thursday she said that I was being too clingy the last few days, and admittedly I was. On Friday, she told me that she wanted to break up to be independent and become her own person.\n\nI was so confused because everything leading up to Wednesday was completely fine. On Sunday I slept over her dorm and we had one of the best dates we've ever had. And then on Tuesday we went to the animal shelter and talked about adopting a dog together. It all happened so fast when she told me she needed space and then decided she wanted to break up. \n\nHer mom was always strict when she was in high school and she felt extremely restricted at home. When she got to college, she had way more freedom and joined a bunch of new clubs and made many new friends. I'm scared that with this new freedom she's decided she doesn't need me.\n\nWe've had our share of fights that have been way way worse like about cheating, (we're not always fighting) and we've always gotten through it. I told her to give it a week and if she doesn't miss me or doesn't feels the same way, then I'd accept her decision and we'd break up. She's already deleted all our photos and is pretty much removing me from her life. But when I asked her if she made her decision, she said that she needed more time. Last night I saw a photo of her wearing my sweater, and she's impulsive so she would never just wear it if she wanted to break up with me. Question is, do I not reach out to her anymore, or try to win her back?\nTL;DR:"}

I don't think he is as invested in our relationship as I am.\nPOST: Maybe I am just being ridiculous but I am consistently getting these feelings that my boyfriend isn't as into the relationship as I am and it is driving me crazy. My previous boyfriends have always been so loving and affectionate and there was never a moment when I even questioned or doubted their true love for me. This situation, however, feels different. While he does tell me he loves me and we have talked about marriage and kids and all that jazz, I just don't get the feeling it's true love for him.\n\nFor instance, the other day, he was on call for work and had just finished up a job. i asked if he wanted to hang out and he said yes, so I went over to his house. He was washing the dishes so I sat outside on his patio and waited for him to finish. 10 minutes comes and goes and he hasn't come outside yet. I walk inside and he's sitting on the couch watching TV and texting one of his friends. That really hurt my feelings so I said I was just going to go home. I didn't hear from him until 5-6 hours later that day.  It was like he was indifferent to my presence. \n\nAnother example: we hadn't seen each other all day and he comes over later that night. We sit on the couch and he immediately gets on his phone and starts facebooking.\n\nAm I being a dumb girl or are these legitimate concerns of mine? What should I do about it? I have confronted him about similar situations in the past and he always brushes it off like it's not a big deal and I am being silly or \"throwing a fit\". It bothers me when he says this to me and I tell him. He'll apologize but it doesn't seem to change. \n\nI really love him and I want this to work but I can't keep dealing with this kind of behavior.

When I tried to apologize I made things worse, as I didn't understand her perspective of events fully. Around two weeks ago I sent a further (intended to be final) email apologizing, got a response more or less accepting my apology, which I replied to with an explanation of why I acted the way I did in which I admitted my feelings for her (she was already aware to an extent, we had discussed it before the fighting started). Her response was that I should never contact her again. So I didn't.\n\nSkip ahead to last Friday, I'm largely over it all and get a text message from her saying hello, I don't notice it until later but i respond with a hello-and no response since.\n\nI assumed the text was an olive branch of some sort, but now there's been no follow up.. I don't understand what I'm supposed to think of that text after two weeks of silence and being told to disappear from her life. Am I expected to re-initiate contact? Was it an olive branch that she regrets sending? Is she fucking with me? What the hell? \n\nI'm fairly annoyed, maybe even angry with her now. Trying to second guess her motives has ruined another weekend, and here I am at work absorbed by this enough that I'm posting about it rather than working.. I don't know if I do want to talk to her anymore but if she had something to say I would still listen. I don't understand how the friendship was destroyed the way it was and I further don't understand her messages to me.\n\nSorry for being overly vague but it's difficult to provide background on events that I don't fully understand without giving away details..\nTL;DR:"}

I've been sick for 10 years and get post-exertion malaise\u2014my body punishes me for exercising. I used to play several sports and was actually quite good and very strong. I miss it more than anything. My question is: what the fuck do you do if you can't exercise and may not even be digesting things properly? I'm on a special diet but internally I'm very fucked up, and my doctor thinks I may not be metabolizing correctly. There is no cure for this disease, and while I'm taking a lot of supplements to reset my metabolism, I'm starting to think I'll never lose weight. How do you come to terms with something like this? How do you accept an overweight body without it feeling like you're giving up? I'm trapped in this body, and the things that should help the situation (diet and excise) are either detrimental to my health or just plain ineffective.\n\nMy hatred for my body runs deep.

At least one fight or argument will break out, guaranteed. Last year was particularly hilarious and it kills me that I have no record of it, so this year I decided to set up a twitter account just before dinner so that I could capture any funny quotes and arguments should they come up.

I captured choice moments via Twitter and no one was the wiser, so I thought. \n\nTurns out one of my teenage cousins, hooked on her smartphone and obsessed with social media, saw what I was doing next to her and while I was tweeting away, looked up the account I was using.

I spend so much time everyday thinking of terrible experiences I would rather go through than breaking up and have been more miserable than I've ever been in my life for weeks. I know I have to just suck it up and do it, but I don't think I can physically bring myself to do it. How do I figure out a way to end this relationship in a way that hurts the least for both of us?\nTL;DR:"}

A couple hours ago, I spotted him sitting right outside the front door. I sit down, and he eventually lets his guard down enough for me to pet him. Now he's sleeping next to my desk, as you can see in the pic below.\n\nI already checked him for a tag and called the local animal control. He's not a threat to anyone, so they told me to call back at 8 A.M. I've been thinking about getting a dog for myself for Christmas, and the timing seems just right for him to walk in.\n\nHe could be microchipped, but if not, do you think it's plausible to keep him? Any pet not claimed for 3 days on base goes up for adaption, and they'll take care of the vetrinary services as part of the adoption fee. I didn't really have a breed in mind as it is, and he seems like what I would want in a dog (not to big/small, gentle temperment).\nTL;DR:"}

I am 17 years old, male, and very inexperienced in the field of love. A couple months ago, I hooked up with a long-time friend of mine while the two of us were hanging out at her place. I've had feelings for her since sophomore year, but I couldn't act upon my emotions back then because she had a boyfriend. For the past two months we've been basically been inseparable and I feel like I'm ready to make things official. \n\nThere's just one problem... her crazy ex-boyfriend won't stop harassing her. He's already graduated from high school (19 years old), but he goes to a nearby community college so he's not going anywhere anytime soon. She tells me she's worried because he's threatened to hurt her friends by BURNING THEIR HOUSES DOWN (he thinks it's their fault through some faulty logic). He also constantly calls her and bombards her voice mailbox with messages. I've offered to contact school counselors for her, but she doesn't want him to get in trouble. She says he makes a lot of empty threats. \nAt this point, I feel like she wants me to confront the ex-boyfriend for her. I refuse to do that though because:\n1) He sounds crazy and\n2) I'm not a fighter.\nSo I'm basically at a loss of what to do. Should I just tell school officials anyways? Should I wait it out? Should I confront the guy?\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend and I met online, and for about 1 year we had a long distance relationship. We decided to move in together after the 1st year, with me moving 2200 miles to be with her. Our relationship was still very new at that point in a lot of ways, and our relationship while living together was very unstable as a result. We argued a lot, didn't understand how to deal with relationship problems, and she was very controlling. She wound up kicking me out several times over the course of my 5 months stay living there.\n\nI wound up coming back after the final time she kicked me out, and I am currently living away from her now in my home town. It has been 5-6 months since then, and we've made a lot of progress in understanding our relationship and understanding each other.\n\nI have a job lined up where she is if I were to move back, and she wants me to move back with her more than anything in this world, and she has wanted this for a long time now. She genuinely misses me, not just the thought of me, and she wants to spend the rest of her life with me. I currently lost my job here where I am living, and it seems like the decision to now move back is that much easier. I'm young, and I feel like giving this a chance may be the right decision because I genuinely love this woman more than anything and I can see spending my life with her. We get along so much better now and we've established boundaries and ways to deal with arguments/differences so much more.\n\nShould I move in with her and give this another shot? I will be put on the lease, we will be signing a written agreement that she will not kick me out under any circumstance for a year (which she fully accepts and wants to do very badly), and everything else seems to be falling into place. \n\nI would appreciate absolutely any advice Reddit, thank you!\nTL;DR:"}

Then, if it lasts to like six months or something, I'll be asked if I'd be okay with something \"more casual.\" Eventually, the girl in question tells me some variation of, \"I'm just not attracted to you/feel the same way about you, anymore.\" It's a routine, like clockwork.\n\n It's not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, but - because these conversations are usually filled with a lot of beating around the bush, and hemming and hawing - I'm left wondering what it could be.

It's beginning to give me a complex, and no degree of introspection is giving me a concrete answer.\n\n I do sometimes notice that, when something does become \"official\" and we say it out loud or whatever, I start to feel really self-conscious about it, and I'm sure that reflects on how I act toward them in some way - less self-assured, perhaps, and more awkward.

I feel like this could be a problem for him, considering the slight age gap. I know he's had sex before and he's a lot more experienced than I am, so it's probably normal for him to have sex fairly early on in a relationship. Which is honestly pretty intimidating to me.\n\nI've asked some of my friends and they all have different opinions - some say that if he's a good guy and he really likes me he'll wait as long as it takes, others say it's unfair for me to expect a 20 year old guy to not have sex until I'm ready.

Things were a bit rushed and I didn't have much time to get myself sorted before leaving for the gym so I was wearing loose boxers, instead of the tight fitted Calvin Klein's that I usually wear. \n\nFast forward to the gym changing room and there's me, my friend and my friend's dad (who decided to come along). So I'm talking to my friend and I'm not really concentrating as I'm taking off my trousers. And you know how when you take off your trousers and usually one leg is off the ground while stepping out of the trouser leg? And you know how sometimes you feel like your testicles are going to make a surprise appearance? Well, this exact thing happened to me. I went to take my leg out of the right trouser leg and as I raised my leg, my lose fitted boxer shorts allowed one of my bollocks to dangle out and say hello to the world. \n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't just my friend who saw. His dad had made eye contact with my hairy bollock and was trying SO hard not to laugh. It was more funny than embarrassing but if you've experienced something like this then you'll understand how awkward it feels.\nTL;DR:"}

How should I handle this?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for about 5 months now. He's amazing; our relationship is amazing. BUT... He does these paintings, and I honestly think they're so terrible. They're abstract and basically just random shapes, which I've always thought is dumb. Plus the brushwork isn't even good--the lines get all muddy (like, brown). And he's so proud of them! My mom is an artist, and I cringe a little bit when I think about him showing his artwork to her.\n\nDo I just suck it up and pretend to like them for the foreseeable future? I mean, I know it's early days yet, but we've talked about it a bit and we're both very serious about this relationship, and if we move in together, he's going to want to put this stuff up on our walls. With any luck I could end up having to lie about this for the rest of our lives!\n\nShould I suggest that we take an art class together? I'm not a super creative type myself but it's all I've been able to think of. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

Saying she only feels comfortable in my arms, and many other things that get very personal and I am want not to share them.\n\nWe've been going steady for about 9 months. long time in our eyes. longest relationship I've ever had. Same goes for her. So I am a pretty caring dude. I try to lend a hand to everyone. Show everybody as much kindness as I can. I did the same with her, except that I was also having sex with her. Now obviously there is more to it than that. If all I wanted was sex then I would have made that incredibly clear from the start. As I did with a previous relationship.\n\nI wanted a fun and caring relationship. Like that of a more intimate friend. I suppose that might not have been clear from the start of our relationship, but now I feel she has gotten too deep and I would be a dick for limiting our relationship when she has clearly crossed that line. She really takes a lot of comfort from me and I help her feel happy with her anxiety about college.\n\nso to leave her would be me dropping my emotional support for her, and giving her the stress of a close relationship ending. And she is very delicate and I would feel terrible doing that to her. And I don't even know that I would want to end things! I really liked how our relationship was going before and I still enjoy it, but her escalating feelings are making me uncomfortable. I feel I need to do something before things get out of hand. But I don't know what.\n\nSo I suppose I want to know a few things. What did I do wrong? What should I take from this experience? What should I do now?\n\nSide note. A lot of this makes me pretty uncomfortable to say because I fear I may have been an asshole, something I thought I was wholeheartedly committed to not being.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I (22 m) feel like my selfishness gets in the way of my relationship with my girlfriend (21 f) and I want it to change\nPOST: I love my girlfriend so much. She is so special to me. However, I seem to always turn her off with behavior that is inherently selfish. We've been going out for a year now and I've never been in a better relationship than this. \n\nI am a person who finds comfort in routine and uniformity. My perfect night is a night in with my gf and a bag of weed and a big tv. I definitely am a \"rut\" kind of person, someone who is comfortable doing the same thing over and over every night. This comfort, however, is pretty detrimental to my relationship sometimes. Because I don't actively try to break my cycle and change things up, I end up making my gf feel less than special. I didn't plan enough for important dates like our anniversary or valentines day, and I don't like changing my plans when I have them already set in my head. \n\nWhenever my gf brings up that I don't make enough of an effort in our relationship, it's often because of my boneheaded clinging to my \"routine\" and not going out of my way to make cool plans or buy gifts for her. \n\nI fear change, but fear losing her more. If you guys have any pointers on how I can make her feel special more often and make her feel like the relationship is exciting and always interesting, I'd appreciate it more than you'll ever know. I want her to feel fulfilled, and I know I can deliver that, but I just need to stop being such a lazy asshole, right?\nTL;DR:"}

We have had our ups and downs.  But for the past year he has only traveled to see me 4 times (3hr drive). In the beginning it was twice a month on my part, now since our one year anniversary its been more frequent ( almost every weekend). My point is that does he really care for me or have i spoiled him since it is more convient for me to drive down. Reasons 1. His car is an older/breaks down on major trips 2. nothing to do in town 3. my parents are awful (which is true that's why i go up there). In any case, in my past relationships the guy would drive up to see me because he cared to see me- I know he cares for me and wants to get married one day(contradiction i know but still).

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: My husband and brother seem uninterested in sex. I'm beginning to think they are still suffering from a childhood trauma. How should I handle this?\nPOST: Maybe you can help me gain some perspective. I've been in a relationship for seven years and got married a little over a year ago. During high school we had a lot of sex, like usually twice or three times a week. Understandably, when we moved in together for year five, the sex became less frequent. I'm under the impression that this is pretty common. Once we became married, our weekly romps became even more rare. Now we only have sex about two times a month but I still maintain the same sex drive that I've had as a teenager. I feel that because of this, I've gained wieght and now a lower self esteem. \n\nNow about three or four times a year my friends and I partake of MDMA. During our last Ecstasy trip my brother (my husband's brother whom I'm really close to) joined us and shared a little too much information with me (a common side effect). He is only 19 but has never dated, kissed, or had sex. He's still young so I've never put too much thought into it until he told me that it's his intention to never marry, have children or be with any woman. He expressed his desire to be the\"40-year-old virgin\" which got me to thinking. I don't think he's gay because our family is pretty understanding and supportive so there is no reason he should feel the need to hide that from us.  I'm beginning to believe that they might be refusing sex because of a childhood trauma they both experienced when they were growing up. What should I do. I think I'm going to stay out of my brother's business but the information he shared with me has me concerned not only for him but for my husband as well. We've shared everything together and I know he's had a hard life growing up. I'm thinking that it's had more of an effect on him than he's let on. Should I suggest therapy?

Since I was about 7, my mom has been on and off about letting me play M rated games. For about the past 4-5 years, I've been playing whatever I wanted. Now, at the start of November, she came into my room, out of nowhere, and told me that I will no longer be allowed to play M-rated/violent games, as long as I am in this house. She doesn't \"believe they're good for me.\" There's a few exceptions, such as Skyrim or Borderlands (I think?). I can't play Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Battlefield, etc. Now, this really bothers me because 1)A large chunk (160 on Steam) of my games are M-rated \"or violent\". 2)I essentially wasted LOTS of money by buying all the games I did, and I had preordered the new Call of Duty game the day before she made this idiotic rule. The only way I can play any of the games I want to play is to wait up early/stay up late, and play when they're asleep. I can't seem to convince her that, \"they're just video games, and they don't affect me.\" It may sound like a very small and stupid thing, but this is my hobby.

We've both admitted that we've never been so comfortable around someone. \n\n* She recently got out of a long term relationship.\n\n* There's a definitive end date for FWB - she's leaving the country (for about a year).\n\n* She's constantly telling her parents about me and is genuinely concerned about making good impressions with my family (she's met them).\n\n* I've had more than one relationship that started with a girl saying she wanted to just be friends and ended being a long term steady relationship. I'm also very experienced in relationships - this one is just too weird to figure out on my own.\n\n* We've already got plans for the entire summer.\n\n* She's been very direct in saying this probably won't go anywhere but FWB and that I shouldn't emotionally invest.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been physically together for about 6 weeks total out of that period although we communicate regularly (Skype,Gtalk, Viber every night, frequent emails etc) I am 27 and she's 33 and we're both very much in love with each other and quite frankly the whole long distance is a pain for both of us and I fear it could only get worse.\nShe is currently studying in LA and once she graduates this year she's going to have to stay there for another year because of her working Visa conditions. As for me, I live in the UK and i will be graduating this year as well (studying BA in Computer Animation). Ideally I'd love to move to the US straight after I finish University and live with my gf but that would be a dream come true and possibly asking too much i guess. \nI understand to be able to get a working visa in the US I'd have to have secured a job before applying or be recognised as an \"artist\" and i'm not sure if that's going to be easy. \nI saw her this Christmas Holidays and I'm going to see her again soon but after that I'm not sure when I'll be able to see her again\u2026 We've been very patient so far but I fear it could only go so far.\nTL;DR:"}

Because of this we have been thinking about getting engaged and buying an apartment together (at the moment we live at our respective family homes) once I graduate from university at the end of the year. \n\nGetting married isn't the problem and we have great communication so he knows what I'm feeling. The issue, however lies in our guest list. My SO left school and basically started working straight away in a small company of only 2 people. As a result of this he doesn't have a wide friend network. He is okay with having just his family, his best friend and me. I don't fault him at that because he isn't antisocial or anything if he meets people he can easily talk to them and get along but he prefers to focus on a few people who he has a deep connection to rather then have a lot of meaningless friendships. Then compared to me who went to university as well as working in a large company where I interact with people a lot more and by having a large family my social network is larger then his.\n\nI am okay with just having our ceremony family only then having a reception or party like thing for friends afterwards but as I have a larger family then his I still feel as though it would be overly my family there which would make him uncomfortable. His family consists of just his parents, his siblings and their partner all up being around 12 people. I am very close to my extended family and because of this my family consists of 19 essential people with the possibility of having an extra 10 if they can afford the travel costs. \n\nI just don't want my SO to be embarrassed by the fact I have a wider social network then he does when it comes to our wedding.\nTL;DR:"}

Things were going fine (I guess) until she went to the doctor and was sent to a specialist because they told her that the amniotic fluid was low. The specialist told her that it was due to something called bilateral renal agenesis which, according to what I could find, means the baby failed to develop kidneys. At this point, they know the baby is basically dead, so after she has it, they're going to be ready for a funeral.\n\nWhen this all happened and they were essentially told this baby will die, I wondered why she didn't prepare to abort it then. I asked my mom because she's the reason I'm writing this, and she texted back: \n\n>Cause it was to late unless went to Colorado and pd thousands. And she just couldn't find it in her heart to do it.\n\n(We live in Kansas.)\n\nNow, the reason I'm writing all of this is because my mom asked me if I would try to find organizations that help cover the funeral costs because nobody in my family can afford it.

The problem we have stems not from ourselves, but from our divorced parents. \n\nA year or so prior to becoming engaged my father asked my then girlfriend and me if we cared if he dated girlfriend's mother. We were not comfortable with it and made our feelings about this known. Our dislike for the situation was played off as immature kids who will eventually come around, so they dated anyways. Fast forward a year and now I am happily engaged with girlfriend, and my father and her mother are in a serious relationship. My fianc\u00e9 and I have never budged from our stance of being uncomfortable with our parents relationship, and it has caused extreme tension between our relationships with our parents. \n\nFor just a little more background, my fianc\u00e9 and I had been dating for over three years when our divorced parents decided to start seeing each other, and even at that time it was widely speculated that girlfriend and I would eventually marry. It's not as though both relationships happened around the same time. During those three years of dating we saw both our parents become divorced and then start seeing each other. This may add to our dislike of their relationship, along with what feels like a million other reasons. \n\nI could rant on and on about why my fianc\u00e9 and I dislike their relationship, and if anyone would like more detail about the situation I am happy to give it, but what I really want opinions on is, \"are fianc\u00e9 and I wrong for making a big deal out of our parents being in a serious relationship?\"  I just want to make sure our feelings of dislike, betrayal, and even disgust at the situation we have been put in are justified before more irreparable damage to our relationships with our parents is done. \n\nFor further clarification, I love my fianc\u00e9 and nothing our parents do will change that in any way. I would not have asked her to marry me if I felt like other people, even our parents could come between us. I'm strictly looking for relationship advice regarding us and our parents.

He has said that it makes him feel guilty that I'm jealous of his free time but that it's my fault because I chose to do this course and that I should accept that and that I can't complain.

However, if she is with a dog who likes to play (e.g. jumping, nipping, you know that typical dogs running and jumping playing around) she totally freaks out. She appears very scared, tries to hide, and will ultimately nip the dog. She hasn't broke skin on another dog but has nipped hard enough to cause a yelp.\n\nThis is a problem when we're out and about. If another dog approaches I'm always a little nervous that the dog will try and jump and play with her.\n\nThis is a MAJOR problem when we visit my father. He has a 1 year lab. The lab, Roxy, is absolutely determined to play with our dog. Out of frustration of the hard headed lab not listening to us, we decided to just let our dog teach Roxy she didn't want to play. Our dog nipped Roxy two times. Both times Roxy yelped, jumped back in surprise, then went back to attempting to play with our dog. Now it would be very nice if Roxy would just \"get it\" and stop trying to play with our dog.\n\nBut I was wondering, is there a way to teach our dog that it's ok to play with dogs by jumping and running around? It's frustrating to visit my father to say the least, and the fact that I'm always nervous when another dog approaches my dog often makes fun beach trips a nerve wracking experience.\nTL;DR:"}

I've been more anxious and wishing to both give and get more love/affection the last month or so. \n\nI try to back off, balance between talking and listening so I'm not just venting to him, but it seems like we're stuck: I feel starved for affection or reassurance or really ANYthing empathetic, while he feels like all we ever do is talk about stuff.

Not on purpose, we were friends, i fell hard. she told me to stay away, was very very cruel to me, and i did tell him i had feelings for him and that i needed to stay away as to not homewreck. they had a nasty break-up, often fought over me (which i didn't know because we didn't speak) though that was not the final reason it ended with them. but of course the second he was willing to come back to me, I did, and it hurt her a lot - even though she was in a VERY seriously relationship with someone else.  She often called him asking why he chose me out of all girls.  Now that I've fallen for him to the extent that she did, I feel immense guilt - because I can't imagine someone taking him away from me.. and it has just fully dawned on me how selfish my thoughts and actions were - though at the time i denied wanting to take him away from her, clearly since it ended up that way, i very much did want this to happen, and therefore very much did not care about completely derailing someone else's life forever.

Any words of wisdom on how to forgive myself, or undo my wrongs?  I can't talk to anyone about this, we have too many mutual friends and I don't want to create (gasp) *drama*.\nTL;DR:"}

What can I do?\nPOST: Previous post:  \n\nFirst, I wanted to thank everyone that ended up posting their opinions.  I can't say thank you enough for spending some of your time giving advice to a random person on the internet.  \n\nMy wife and I are looking into legal separation / divorce.  Our plan is to still remain great friends after all of this, just not sexual partners. \n\nSo, wife and I have talked about things, and while she is not attracted to me anymore, she's not attracted to men at the moment either (sexuality is fluid).  She's not 100% sure where her interests lie (until she attempts another relationship after ours truly ends), but that's all her, of course.  \n\nWhat I am seeking a few other pieces of input on, is whether to stay in the same condo (separate rooms) for financial reasons.  We both agreed that it's a solid option for both of us (so no financial hardship).    \n\nIs it feasible to live in the same house with your ex?  Request some rules regarding bringing romantic partners over?  Is it even feasible to remain friends through this?  I've already got a lawyer on retainer to help with this divorce / legal separation process.  \n\nAlso, any suggestions on places to look for assisting with coping with all of this? Podcasts? Articles? Books to read?  I'm seeking counseling to help me out in the near future.\n\n...happy Monday?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [20 M] with my girl [21 F] 1 year. She smokes, says she wants to quit, instead smokes even more, I am pissed\nPOST: Hi guys and gals\n\nSo I couldn't be happier about our relationship. It's like we both found our \"missing puzzle piece\" (sounds soft, I know). But there's one thing; she smokes (cigarettes). She already smoked when I first met her. But like 4-6 cigarettes a day. I couldn't even smell it when kissing her right after she smoked one. And she said she wants to quit it, and she's going to reduce it. \n\nNow, 1 year later, she hasn't stopped. She smokes even more now. I'm not really \"keeping track\" of it, but it's around 10-20 per day, depending on what we're doing. It's REALLY frustrating. And she always says \"I have to wait for the right moment to quit, then it will work\". And this pisses me of so much. When I try to tell her, she flipps her shit. No matter what I say (from \"Look, I'm concerned about your health\" to \"Another one? Really? You had one like 15 minutes ago\"). \n\nShe is a very, VERY smart person. And she's very good at planning, and is saving for education purposes since quiet some time (started before we met). So this totally doesn't make sence. It's not \"her\". It costs so much money, and it's really dangerous (considering health stuff). And I smell it. BOY do I smell it. I could sometimes throw up when I give her a kiss, when I smell the smoke. \n\nWhat can I do to help her quit? She still wants to quit, but I fear that she is much more addicted, than she admits.\nTL;DR:"}

I've gone from from 130 (overweight) to 100 lbs since March. I went from a tight small to a loose extra small, pants size 5 to 0. I cut out junk food except on some special occasions, cut out any soda other than water and some 0 calorie drinks (vitaminwater 0, propel zero). I started eating the recommended 5 servings of fruits and vegetables. I never eat above 1300 calories. I'm actually having trouble eating enough now. I'm full all the time! I eat few carbs and a lot of protein. When I get less than 50 grams of protein a day I drink some whey protein powder. 90 calories and gets me 20 grams of protein. I started out slowly with exercise, maybe 15 minutes running, 15 walking, but over the summer I got obsessed. It is so fun! I was swimming for an hour, biking for 1 1/2 hours, and walking for an hour every day. I do not recommend that. I was tired, but I just enjoyed feeling my body move. I joined a gym, because I wan't getting enough strength exercises, and I'm up to doing 150 lat pulldowns at 37.5 pounds (50 at a time). I'm not super skinny, but I'm pretty happy how I look. I used to have an eating disorder, so I don't want to go overboard. The obsession with food is still there, but I'm focusing it on being healthy, not under nourishing my body. I'll never be a skinny as I was then (it was definitely not healthy at 82 lbs) but I like feeling good about myself. I'm definitely getting more male attention too! I went from a BMI of 25.81 to  19.86. I'm thinking of going a little lower and gaining a little more muscle to see more definition in my stomach and arms, but we'll see. The point is that I'm almost done.\nTL;DR:"}

Neither of my parents graduated high school and my sister didn't take much interest in school/ dropped out. \n\nI have always loved learning and have taken school very seriously for my whole life. I ended up at a university in Boston (almost entirely paid for) as an engineering major. I'm graduating next semester and it is the most exciting accomplishment of my life. While I'm extremely happy that I'll be graduating, I've always felt a lot of guilt because I don't want my family to feel like I think I'm better than them or that the lifestyle that I grew up with wasn't good enough. It makes it difficult to talk about college because I never want to sound like I'm bragging. \n\nI've changed a lot during college (in hopefully good ways) and have only gotten more interested in my studies. I love to talk about what I'm doing with my life, such as my classes, my research, post grad job offers, etc (this sounds very self absorbed...). When I go home for vacations though, I feel like these topics fall on deaf ears. No one shares my interests or really even understands what they are. I'm not even sure that my parents know what my major is. It's not a matter of them not caring (I don't want to make it sound like they are awful), it's a matter of different interests/ lack of understanding of what I'm actually doing. It's starting to get pretty depressing because I have so much in my head that I would like to share with my family but there is really no one to talk to.\n\nAm I just being a pretentious asshole/ self absorbed? What can I do to get them more engaged in things I'm interested in? Or should I just let those interests go while I'm visiting?\nTL;DR:"}

I make the announcer we're closing at 10 but she's still taking her time.

I ask manager to turn them back on as she freaks out and pays and I unlock the door for her to leave. We put her items back, lock up and go home. That should be it right? Wrong. \n\nShe called my manager that next morning saying how I was rude to her and stole her wallet with $3000 in cash. My manager calls me and asks me what happens and I tell her. The lady keeps calling back and harassing my manager for not giving her my name. So the woman calls the police on me!! They check the tapes of that night and then call me asking me what happened. \n\nThe kicker is that the woman said I knew her pregnant daughter.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I think I'm being cheated on, so I kind of need some advice\nPOST: Ok, so I started dating this girl a year and a half ago. She was an au pair and while we both said we didn't want to, we got kind of serious pretty quick. After about a year she started getting really homesick and we decided that she should go home and that we would do long distance until we figured things out. Things got sour after a while because of the difficulty communicating with an 11 hour time difference and we broke up but she never wanted to break contact. I kind of like to go the Ghost Protocol route with ex's when we break up so eventually I had to answer one of her messages if for no other reason than to stop the madness. Now don't get me wrong, I loved the girl, but my only way of dealing with not being with someone like that is to close that chapter on my life. So to get back on track, I finally break down and talk to her and she tells me how big of a mistake it all was to leave and then to break up. She tells me how she wants to be with me and she wants to \"give us a chance\". So basically I say she is right and that we were hasty and we start talking pretty regularly. She asks me multiple times if I'm talking to girls and I always explain that it is the last thing on my mind and she has said the same. Now here's the thing. My phone broke a couple weeks ago and I haven't had the money to replace it because I do catering and my hours are based on the amount of orders. I haven't had any hours really since my phone broke due to a random dry spell and so it's still not fixed and communicating with anyone these days seems to be impossible. I don't know how we lived even a decade ago without cellphones. I've been off Facebook for months, ever since my ex and I broke up actually, so I guess that would be my communication outlet without a cellphone. My buddy has been telling me this for a week or so, finally he told me to look at his FB and it's her profile with another guy time-stamped yesterday with the label of \"Psychedelic Boyfriend\".\nTL;DR:"}

To top it off, when she showed up, 2.5hrs late as everyone was leaving, she was wearing a hijab (She recently converted to Islam; REALLY long story) The first thing she says is \"So [my husband] threatened to kill me & I was at the FBI office yesterday.\" No \"Hi honey\" or \"Sorry I'm late,\" immediately turns the attention on her (not that the hijab hadn't solidified that already).

Usually, these periods reach a peak where one of us (usually me) gets really overwhelmed and we have to sit down and have a long talk about what we're going to do, and breaking up has been on the table at least twice.  But, we've managed to turn things around and make them better than before.\n\nWe're going through a somewhat low period, but not as intense as in the past.

Should I feel weird?\nPOST: So, I've been in one relationship for the past seven years. We got married last year and are in the process of getting divorced this year. I'll spare the details of that but we just felt it was best to go separate ways and have been separated since the summer. Since the separation, I went on some dates with someone my age (29) and that was fine but I ended up breaking things off with her. She was cool but she was feeling heavier feelings for me than I was feeling for her so didn't want it to go further. \n\nFast forward to yesterday... I started talking to a girl and got her number with a hint at a future date. She seemed pretty cool and I've come to find out that she is 21. I'm a bad judge of age, I guess, because I didn't expect that. I'm not sure if I should jut put a halt to it now because of the age difference or just have fun with it anyway and try going on a few dates with her. The age gap kinda feels weird just due to having different responsibilities for the both of us but differences aren't necessarily a bad thing. Thoughts?\nTL;DR:"}

He's willing to give up a 'potential' career to live with me but only if I financially support him until he finds his dream job. Advice?\nPOST: Hi, throwaway here. I need advice/suggestions from other people who are or have been in my situation.  I've also cross posted in R/long distance (hope that's ok!).\n\nI'm (f27) in a LDR with my SO (28m). We've been together for 5 years and long distance for 3. I work in a highly specialised field that takes years of training (though not one that pays especially well). He works in the creative industry and whilst has been getting steadily more work over the last 3 years, barely makes the minimum wage.\n\nLast year I moved to a different country for work. I'm finding it very difficult and lonely (big city, don't know anyone): he's at home, settling in socially and finding his niche. I already feel guilty asking him to move over to stay with me. He tells me that he will be giving up a potentially lucrative career to do so.\n\nHowever, at the moment he is earning very little and if he does move over, I will have to move flat (I need to prove I have room for him on the visa application) which in this city would bring my rent to over double what it is (and over half my pay check) and I will need to pay for food, bills etc while he 'works on his portfolio' and applies for jobs. He says it may take up to six months to find a job in his field and he refuses to take 'just any job' to help out in the meantime.\n\nI'm kind of baulking at this. I understand he is ambitious: we both are, but I can't help feeling it's unfair that I get to feel guilty for taking away him away from his 'potential' career and have to take a huge hit financially until he finds another one that suits him. I have discussed this with him but it just results in him getting cross and me upset.\n\nHas anyone else had an SO move to live with them and had to support them financially afterwards?

His grandfather is having health problems and his dog who he had for 15+ years died day before yesterday. He's really down. He cancelled our plans for the weekend and is reclusive. \n\nNow I know this is the way he deals with things. This isn't the first time life has sprung its evils on one of us. However, I always seem to take it personally when he takes his time to grieve and deal. He almost stops talking to me completely and if I do see him he's always almost completely silent. I guess it just hurts he won't talk to me when I really want to be there for him. \n\nSo this is where you come in, reddit. How can I support him in a way that makes him comfortable? What can I do? I just want to be there for him, but I don't want to seem needy.\nTL;DR:"}

It's the thought \"My GF does coke\" that I can't brush-off inside. That's not something I'd EVEN consider doing in a million years, I feel like this shift of mindset (about taking drugs) is distancing me emotionally.

Although I have become kinda jelous lately and here is why:\n\nShe's going away on trips with her school, there are three to be exact so she will be sharing a room with mixed guys and girls. There is a lot of alcohol involved in these trips and a lot of partying. I'm jelous for obvious reasons, I don't trust her when she's drunk. \n\nBUT she has never done anything to make me distrust her (to my knowledge). I feel like a piece of crap. I tried to be very honest about me being jelous, but she says that there is nothing she can say or do that will make me feel better. She also says that my jelousy will only make it more likely that she would be unfaithful, which also feels like crap because now it feels like a can't be honest and have to fake that I'm totally okay with her going away for three separate weeks and partying hard in fear of her fooling around with other guys. \n\nI think a major reason of me not being okay with this is that whenever she is with me, she doesn't want to drink. She has only been drunk ONE time with me and that night ended in a disaster. It feels like if I knew that she was a normal person when she was drunk I would be okay with this, but I don't know her \"drunk self\" and I feel like this is the core issue. Does this make sense, or am I a crazy boyfriend who's thinking completely irrationally?\nTL;DR:"}

I plan on getting a job, and have a trial tomorrow, the trouble is I desperately want to go home for my holidays, easter and summer. But, and what i didn't realise until now, from my employers perspective they are hiring me, only to lose me during their busiest season. \n\nLet me try and explain this situation the best I can. \n\nIm 19 and studying around 260 miles and a ferry ride from my rural home, so quick trips home are out of the equation. At home I have a part time job Waiting and as Kitchen Porter, I am close to my friends and family and I'm staying with my parents **(rent free!!)** \nAt Uni, I am paying rent, bills, groceries and studying. My course is only 3 days a week, so i have time to waste (work). \n\nSo i guess my questions to you are: should i take on a job during term time, and hope they understand i want to go home during summer (when they need employees the most), and risk them not letting me leave? Will I  have to quit/lose my job? Or do I find somewhere to live whilst i work here through summer, so I can hold down a job I might not necessarily have after summer during term time, and end up earning less than I would at home?\n\nI know that staying here and holding a job down through summer might be best in the long term, but i feel if i stay here through summer I'll be missing out on everything and everyone back home and will be insanely homesick.\n\nThanks for your time, M.\nTL;DR:"}

He's always meant the world to me (we've been together for almost 2 years) and he's helped me through a lot so losing him again would really hurt.

Part of me still loves her, cares a lot about her and thinks she should learn to be honest and tell herself when people ask - punishing her won't help things, another part of me just wants revenge and thinks that she brought it on herself and that she deserves her reputation to burn down to ground.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: taking a break, good in this situation?\nPOST: My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) decided as of two days ago to take a  break. We have been dating for just shy of three years, and things  were fine I thought. We had been slipping into the \"comfortable\"  stage, and had had a few talks about trying to make more of an effort  to keep up the physical end of the relationship, but other than that things were good. \n\nThe issue that lead to the break started because we didn't see each other for a longer period of time than usual. We go to  different colleges, but they are pretty close, so we see each other every weekend. He's been  really busy at the end of this year though, so we didn't visit each other  the last three weekends, so he could focus on his work. Then five days ago, he tells me he's grown seriously doubtful about our relationship.  He says he started getting concerned when he realized that he was  enjoying our time apart, and was not missing me very much. We had  a lot of talks from there, and things only got worse. Ultimately, we  wound up on a break. \n\nI feel like when he gets  through the end of the year stress, he'll feel a lot better, and will be more  emotionally available to be in this relationship. Our foundation is very strong, and I have a hard time believing that it's really just gone over the course of a few weeks. On the other hand,  he seems so sure about his doubts (if that makes any sense), that I am really concerned about the situation. Our break is definitely not just because he's afraid to end it now. Neither one of us thinks we should just break up at this point. But now I'm stuck being a park of this break, and it's killing me. I try to stay hopeful and give him his space to clear his mind, but at the same time, the possibility that it could actually just end makes it really hard.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experience with being on a break that worked out? Does this seem like the kind of situation where a break could actually help?\nTL;DR:"}

Basically, we broke up in March and she immediately started dating someone new. Pretty sure they are still together, the past 6 months were filled with me basically trying to get her back. Back in August, she stated that she wanted to be my friend, she didn't keep her word, and now she never wants to talk to me.\n\nNow two days ago, as i'm driving a friend to work, I get a phone call from her mother screaming at me saying that I had uploaded stuff about her daughter to the internet when I had never done anything of the sort. I was threatened with police action but I had nothing to hide which is okay. The entire 14th was just my family waiting for the parents and police to show up, and they never came. I tried contacting my ex to leave me alone regarding the subject, and we have now blocked each other.\n\nI was kind of hoping to be friends with her at some point, but tensions are beyond strong between us. This thing of her accusing me has put me over the edge in regards to me never wanting to talk to her again, but part of me is still there. \n\nWhat should I do? Continue to cut her off out of my life, or somehow try to look over this and propose friendship in the future? If there needs to be any more clarification, I will respond to anything.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/running\nTITLE: How can I know when it's safe for me to run on a stress fracture?\nPOST: I hurt myself during the end of May and ended up with a tibial stress fracture. I visited the doctor and I was cleared to run on Wednesday the 29th (June). He said to start out slow and only do a mile a day, ramping up the daily mileage by a quarter of a mile each week. After doing two one mile runs this week I am still experiencing pain. I am worried that I am still injured because my doctor felt X-Rays were only necessary. A few hours after my first run my leg was tender at the spot of the fracture. The following day, Thursday, I felt fine but rested just in case. On Friday I did another mile but after the run it hurt again. Is this pain usual? I can't tell if I'm hurting myself or am just experiencing phantom pains or calcium  deposits. I am really eager to run, but I am also super paranoid about reinjuring myself. Going back to the doctor isn't really an option right now because you have to wait almost 3 weeks to schedule an appointment. Is there any good way to know if its safe for me to run?

I do as well due to many past relationships, as does he. I also know I tend to be more \"emotionally needy\" and need deep connection in relationships more than most. \n\nI tend to be very verbal, open, and open to anything new with him. He is verbal, open, and open to new things from time to time...\n\nHe warned it would take a while for him to fully open up with me, and I accepted that, but there are small things that tend to irk me and I'm unsure of what to do or if I'm just overreacting. \n\nExamples: Never wants to drink around me but will drink anytime he is with his own friends. Won't open up about anything emotional unless asked about it. If his friends are over while I am also, he tends to act differently towards me and even more distant than normal. If I attempt to talk to him about my insecurities (personal low self confidence/esteem) he tends to downplay the seriousness of what I say. Lack of outward emotion in person and over phone or texts makes it seem like he cares little, even though I know he does care a lot (or at least I'm pretty sure he does...). Claims he's more open when he drinks and \"maybe one day\" I'll see that side of him. \n\nIs this how all guys are or is it normal? Or am I just overreacting and being too emotionally needy.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm on a dead-end street at the top of a hill, so its always windy (25+ mph winds on a weekly basis). My doofus neighbors across the road decided last Saturday to put up some sort of bell/wind chime hybrid and it clanged out the same tone endlessly since then, sounding like somebody was proposing a toast at a wedding all night long.

The response yelled back from inside was a gruff woman screaming \"I ain't takin' ma bell down, I LOVE MA BELLS\". Two of her extremely embarassed teenage children (who she regularly yells at from her perch near an open 2nd floor window) stepped out and quietly commented that they will 'take care of it'.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\nTITLE: How does one gain romantic/sexual \"confidence\" with little to no basis for such confidence?\nPOST: 26/M here. Despite my title making me sound like I'm lacking confidence, I've done a lot of dating and have had plenty of experiences. Some of them good, but a lot of bad ones. I'm not super tall (5'6'') and I wouldn't say I'm great looking, but I clean up nice. I'm handsome, but I'm not \"hot\".\n\nHere's what I'm wondering. I've already established that I'm a short, fairly average looking guy. People talk all the time about how \"confidence is key, confidence is sexy, blah, blah\", which is fine at face value, but it would seem that confidence is largely gained from external assurance (i.e., someone telling you that you're attractive, getting hit on, etc). It would be easy to walk up to a man/woman \"knowing\" that you've got a good chance of success because you've gotten plenty of positive reinforcement. But what about those of use who aren't in the upper echelons of physical beauty, who have had little to no assurance of their attractiveness (or worse even, negative reinforcement)?\n\nThe approach I've taken over the years is \"fake it 'til you make it\", which seems to work from time to time. If I'm honest, there are times when I DO feel a genuine confidence, but there are still many time where I find myself thinking \"she's out of your league, she won't go for a guy like you\". It's not because I hold myself at a low value, it's because my past experience have \"taught\" me where my boundaries lie.\n\nTo put a bow on this whole thing, I don't think little of myself. In fact, I'd say my self-worth is high. I'm intelligent, educated, I've got my life together, I'm ambitious, athletic, etc, etc... But none of those traits are visible when approaching a stranger. How does one gain confidence in the romantic arena when they have no prior basis for such confidence.\n\nThank you all! Any advice, insight, wisdom is greatly appreciate and valued!\nTL;DR:"}

But recently, she's started to show an interest in girls and wants to have sex with one. This bothers me so much. She says she wants to know what it feels like but I can't stand the sight or thought of her being pleased by another person. It doesn't matter if she's a girl. I feel like I should accept it and there's nothing wrong with it but it certainly does feel like cheating, she's not lesbian or bi she's just curious. It's not like she's constantly pursuing to want to have sex with a girl, it's just something she wants to do.\n\nSo I offered an alternative, what if we have sex (just me and my girlfriend) while you do stuff with the other girl. She said she doesn't want that at all and doesn't want to have sex with me when she's with the other girl, this hurt me a lot. Is it normal to be hurt over that? She said she'd be okay with giving me oral while she gets eaten out but still, that's not enough, I feel left out and like a nuisance. Why does she want to do it without me so bad? She says she wouldn't want me to have sex with the girl, which is hypocritical. Just the thought of her wanting to have sex with another person hurts me, I wish I could accept it and not let it bother me but it does. It's almost as bad as her saying she wants to have sex with another guy. And the fact that she wants me involved as little as possible really hurts me.\nTL;DR:"}

This morning I was surprised to discover that not only did she go out, she stayed out til 6am her time.

I [30F] am in love with a cheater [30M]\nPOST: I was 21. We dated. We were young. I think the biggest problem is we never really knew what we wanted to do with our lives and never realized our dreams before things got serious. Whatever the reason (or excuses), he cheated. A lot. With a lot of different people. We broke up. I forgave him. We are still no contact. What bothers me most is not the cheating, but that it was so deliberate at the time...and he didn't tell me himself. It was heartbreaking to go through that at such a young age. I was messed up about it for a long time.\n\nFast forward. Nearly a decade. I've dated since then. Been through a couple long-term relationships that eventually faded. I still think of him. Every day. And then I beat myself up about it. Because why? He treated me like shit, move on. But I literally have never found anyone that holds a candle to him. We were great together. Until the end, all of my memories are golden. The laughs, the amazing sex, the everything. I know I maybe shouldn't because it doesn't making any sense-but I know I still love him. \n\nI don't know if it would be shooting myself in the foot to reach out to him now. We have a complicated past, to be sure. Is it worth reaching out to him to catch up? I'm not planning on diving full force into a relationship, but I'm definitely curious about where he is now and if he still thinks of me. Hell, maybe he's even married by now and that would put a stopper in it all together.\n\nHas anyone else ever held on to someone for this long? Is something wrong with me? Advice, thoughts, perspective?\nOnce a cheater always a cheater?\nTL;DR:"}

We go to the same college, and this summer she's living in my apartment while I'm living in a different city about an hour away working at an internship. So far, I've made the trip back just about every weekend.\n\nThe problem is, this weekend I just really don't want to go back and I'm not sure how to explain it to her without her getting pissed. I'm a somewhat introverted person - occasionally, I need an hour or two or even a few days just to hang out by myself, drink beer, play video games and skype with my friends, just chill out. She is the complete opposite - she has no problem spending all our time together. I enjoy seeing her, but sometimes I just need a break.\n\nTo add to the problem is that she works a ton - food service - so if I go back home this weekend, she'll be working for 4-5 hours each day in the middle of the day and I'll spend most of my time waiting for her to get off. Neither of us have a ton of extra money at the moment either, so then we spend the rest of the evening trying to find something to do, not succeeding, and going to bed early.\n\nLike I said - honestly, I really just need some bro time this weekend, but I have no idea how to tell her that without her getting sad or pissed off. I had already said I would do something she wanted to do - a walk in a park she wanted to see - so at this point, I can either make up some bullshit about car troubles, tell her straight up and piss her off, or just deal with it.\n\nWhat do I do this afternoon, and to help with this in the future?\nTL;DR:"}

I don't believe I did.\nPOST: Work requires me to spend several days per week out of town in different places. Every night I usually call my ole' lady, \"Erin\", to talk about our day. Tuesday evening I went to dinner with some colleagues which is not unusual. There were three of us, \"Mike\"(28m), \"Lisa\"(26f) and myself, \"Sir Terry IV\". We've all known each other for about 2 years and see each other about 2 or 3 times a quarter.  Before I go any further I want to make it clear that I don't believe alcohol was a factor. Only 1 beer was consumed, that was Mike's. \n\nAt some point during dinner Lisa and Mike got on the subject of oral sex skills; Mike had actually steered the conversation this way because of his crush on Lisa. Lisa was adamant that despite her limited number of sexual partners, she was still excellent at pleasing. Mike eventually challenged Lisa to demonstrate her abilities on him. Lisa flatout and sternly refused Mike's invitation, but added \"...I'd definitely show \"Sir Terry IV\"! Stunned and in an effort to re-lighten the mood after that rejection, I said \"That would sound great if I was single, but you can have at it on my thumb\". Lisa immediately grabs my thumb and starts exhibiting her fellatio skills for a solid 20 seconds or so. We all laughed about it and that was it. The conversation eased back to more appropriate topics. That was the night. We all went to our own separate hotels/homes.\n\nUpon telling Erin about this, she immediately lost her shit. She says allowing Lisa to suck on me that way was cheating. I contend that it wasn't. She says even though I told her about it immediately, she doesn't know she can trust my judgement because this incident opens up a slippery slope. She was cold last night and isn't responding to any of my messages at all today. This is very unlike her.\nTL;DR:"}

I was like \"Fuck yeah, I have to impress the shit out of her.\"\n\nAs I'm doing a move that looked decently cool, and a pretty scary one to commit to, Robin hit a punchline that just made me laugh out loud immediately and I couldn't hold on to the wall at that point. While falling back off the wall, I grabbed the rope near where it was connected to my harness, and EVER JUST SO CONVENIENTLY, the rope snags on a hold above me, whiplashing the rope on my face where I was holding it. So in essence, I punch myself *really* hard in the face and my nose starts dripping with blood instantly. This whole ordeal turned me 180 degrees, facing her direction, and my shirt gets snagged on a hold on the way down - pulling my shirt kind of over my head like The Great Cornholio, but sort of backwards. I slowly was let down by the auto-belay and I didn't even look at her when I hit the ground. I just got up, took all my shit off, and left.

I had read online that ducks of such young age shouldn't get wet unless they are dried off and put under a heating lap. When it came time for me to clean their areas I had taken the ducks into the house to swim in our tub so that my daughter could watch them. She is only about 10 months so she loves watching them. After their little swim, I drained the water but decided to leave them in the tub since they were a bit older than last time while I finished cleaning their pen. About a half hour later my friend goes upstairs to find that two of the ducks are convulsing and what looks like trying to break-dance while the other two repeatedly stomp on them! We quickly grabbed up the 2 that looked fine and put them under the lamp then quickly tried to dry and take care of the other two.  We managed to nurse one back to health but one was not so lucky.

He didn't know what was ailing him yet, but was nervous. He promised he just needed a friend. His engagement just fell through as well, so he was feeling extra vulnerable. Chandler, not being the jealous type, agreed that being a shoulder for Richard was the right thing to do.\n \nThis arrangement quickly went south as his feelings towards me were not well hidden and I felt like I was being sneaky, even though I was keeping Chandler well informed. It ended with Richard leaving me a message confessing his love and asking me to leave Chandler. We hadn't talked since..\n\nUntil today. Richard found out he has Leukemia, he wants to talk.\nTL;DR:"}

Earlier this year I got into a squabble with his sister [24/25] because we went to a gaming tourney and she ended up saying really hurtful things about me to him and to his friends. Obviously he told me and I confronted her about it and asked why.\n\nShe made a bunch of lame excuses and then blocked me on all media/phone because I had initially defriended her after hearing what was said of me. (It wasn't just insults, it was really deep rooted personal offensive stuff that I can not ignore). Feeling so disrespected and embarrassed by her behavior, he hasn't talked to her since. His family is very, VERY \"family first\" oriented but knows she is in the wrong.\n\nRecently she ended up blocking her own brother (my bf) because he sided with me over her. \n\nWe are very serious and have frequently talked engagement lately, however I hate the idea of 1) being related to his sister and 2) that if we continue this relationship, eventually he will break up with me to bring peace to the family or stay with me and stop communicating with his family altogether (something he has been leaning towards as of late as he goes a long time without talking to them now).\n\nI want him to have a healthy relationship with his family and with me but I think that the drama that has ensued this year could ruin it. I would refuse to have his sister participate in anything if we did get married (and she will not apologize), but that would make the family hate me more if I didn't include her.

They flirted a little bit in text, and that's it.\nThen she discussed it with another friend of hers and she decided not to text him again.\n\nNow, about 3-4 weeks ago, while my girlfriend and I were on holiday, this guy contacted her and they flirted a little bit again, nothing serious though. Btw, I don't think he knew we were on holiday, he might not even know about me, as far as I know this is the only contact they had in 6 months. I think they might have had a thing for each other even before I met her but I think that nothing happened between them.\n\nThis guys lives in another town, and we moved to yet another town. I moved here 2 weeks ago, and my girlfriend just came after me.\n\nThe first weekend my girlfriend was alone, they chatted again, flirting got a bit more serious, nothing explicit though. The guy said that the week after he would be in the same town as my girlfriend so they agreed to meet.\n\nMy girlfriend discussed this again with her other friend, she told her that they would meet, but nothing could happen between them.\n\nThen the day came when they were supposed to meet, they were both out partying separately, but they did not meet in the end.\n\nSo, this is where we are now and I'm not sure what to do. I feel bad for reading her messages but I also feel bad that she's flirting with another guy. Is this something I should be worried about or is this just some meaningless flirting. Should I talk to her about it?  They are probably not gonna see each other for quite a while, but I don't like the thought that she's thinking about another guy.\nTL;DR:"}

I generally refuse to speak to them at all. Ever.\n\nI recognize this as an ego problem. I can't take rejection. I know it would be good to learn how to get past it, become a bigger person, hold fewer grudges, etc. But it seriously burns me up so bad that I can't. Even if I have zero interest in the person anymore. \n\nI feel physically incapable of ever being genuinely friendly toward anyone who has taken my heart and my emotions and stomped on them. Even 5 years later, or 8 years. It's already hard for me to admit that I have feelings (ENTJ), and if I show them to you and you throw them in my face, you are basically dead to me. Even if you don't throw them. Even if you just gently hand them back to me and say, \"No thanks.\" Still dead to me. Forever.\n\nI know, I know. It's a harsh line.\n\nI do wonder: How is this going to burn me in the future? Give me some good reasons to work on this aspect of my personality, Redditors!

I've gone travelling in South America with two people in my year at highschool, (one was a good friend, other was a friend of this friend). I wasn't aware of their mutual interest in each other until we landed in Peru and we were spending 24 hours around each other. Things became tense but we all had our happy faces on. Two weeks in, we're in La Paz, Bolivia, and I suggest we split paths as they clearly didn't want me around as much as I tried to be friendly and helpful.\n\nThis left me with a chip on my shoulder, especially after travelling alone for the remaining month but it made me stronger in way. \n\nFast forward four years, I've completed my first degree and I met an amazing girl but only towards the end of the final year. She was bound for Chile anyway so nothing serious formed between us even though we professed our interest in each other. We've been talking on Skype and I've been toying with the idea of flying all the way from the UK to see her and go travelling together. After being left high and dry for ten days I get a message that she is in a relationship with a guy in Chile. She is still expecting me to plan a trip over;\n\nSo was I being naive? Did I misinterpret something? Fair enough, its stupid of me to expect her to jeep other guys at bay whilst thousands of miles away. But I just will not spend hundreds of pounds to go travelling in South America as a third wheel again, even though she is being very mature about it all, she is very mature in her character.\nTL;DR:"}

I compose music for Warner Brothers and they have a studio known as Warner Chappell in Salt Lake, which is why we live here currently. I'm pretty fresh in the industry so buying a mansion out in the wilderness isn't really an option right now. I'd definitely be better off working in LA or NYC or something, but Salt Lake is as metropolitan as my country girl wife can handle. She is always depressed about how crowded and noisy everything is here. She's very introverted and craves the privacy of a secluded log cabin. I've lived all around the world and find our current neighborhood as quaint as it gets without living in the middle of nowhere. We don't make a ton of money right now and I'm doing the best I can to provide a decent living, but for us to be able to live out in the bush would require a lot more capital on our end that we don't have. How do I help her find the joy in her day to day life and not let her surroundings dictate her happiness? What she wants is not something we, or most people for that matter, can afford right now, not to mention Montana is so freezing I don't think I'd survive a winter there. How can I help her? I've just been able to find the joy in wherever I've lived over the years so I have no concept of home sickness, but it's eating her up. Any insight? Thanks!\nTL;DR:"}

Normally, he's really good about keeping in touch via text,  but last time he left he dropped off the radar & didn't text me goodnight like he always does. I figured he'd fallen asleep or gotten drunk with his work friends, no big deal.\n\nLast night I had crazy dreams about him screwing another woman while he was away. It was vivid and horrifying, but I put the dream down to some painkillers I'd been on following spraining my foot. \n\nThis morning his phone went off and he asked me to read the text. It was from his male coworker who he'd been on the trip with. However,  I saw a text further up the conversation from the morning after he hadn't responded it said \"sheets changed and room aired out.\"\n\nBetween the weird dream and this text i find myself worrying about something nepharious. I know he and his coworker didn't share a room.  What could that possibly mean? We're due to be married in august.\n\nThere had been an incident in the past where he went to a strip club with his coworkers.

I have never given him any reason to doubt me before, and have been completely faithful to him - I also do not have a history of cheating/lying/deception in my past relationships. I value trust in a committed relationship, and have not acted suspicious or secretive in any way, because I have nothing to hide.\n\nBUT, a few days ago, I picked up my phone and discovered that a conversation with my ex was pulled up, indicating that my boyfriend had been looking through my text messages without my knowledge.  The texts with my ex were innocent and not in any way sexual or emotionally charged. In fact, I had not even responded to several of them because I either forgot or wasn't really that interested in the conversation to begin with. \n\nWhen I confronted him, he admitted that he did look through my texts and that he was wrong. When I asked him if he did it because he doesn't trust me, he claimed that he does trust me, but since he's been hurt by his former girlfriends, seeing my ex's number in my phone got the best of him and he looked through my messages out of curiosity. \n\nI have always heard that if your SO looks through your texts when you aren't around, that they don't trust you and the relationship is probably over. Is this true? Is this no big deal, or does it seem like we might have a bigger problem in our relationship?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/tifu\nTITLE: TIFU by getting toys taken away from orphans.\nPOST: Alright, so this happened about two and half years ago. \n\n22 years old, fresh out of college, I decided to go volunteer at an orphanage in Poland. Wonderful place, incredible kids. \n\nA few weeks into my stay, my group and I traveled to a nearby city for a day or two and before we headed back, we decided to bring some toys back for the kids as a nice surprise. A friend decided on those [toy helicopters] attached to a wooden dowel where you have to spin it in your hands and let go. \n\nWe got back and the kids loved them of course. They ran around spinning them with awe as if they were the single greatest invention of mankind. Eventually, a little boy motions to me with his helicopter, trying to say \"hey, wanna try?\" I give him a look that says, \"heck yes I do.\" \n\nSo I take the helicopter. For those who have never had any experience with these types of toys, it is pivotal to remember that you must spin your hands in the correct direction. One way sends the toy up ahead in a wondrous flight path, the other way...sends it right into your face. And that's exactly what I did.\n\nBut this wasn't any old helicopter spin. Before I initiated liftoff, I very deliberately thought to myself, \"I really want to wow these kids, so I'm going to spin the fuck out of this helicopter.\" And so I did. I spun that helicopter as fast and as hard as humanly possible...directly into my left eye. \n\nI spent the rest of that night traveling back to the city and being assessed by a Polish optometrist whom I didn't understand at all. My cornea was significantly scratched, but luckily I didn't need surgery. \n\nWhen I got back to the orphanage, I learned that all the helicopters had been taken away from the children. As a result of my self-inflicted incident, they had been deemed \"too dangerous.\" On the bright side, I got to impersonate a pirate for the next few days!\nTL;DR:"}

For almost a year and half, I have been plagued with what many would consider emotional abuse. He has horrible anger management and would not spare anyone when he is on a rampage. Not even his mother. I have seen him throw things, tipping over tables and screaming when his mother asked him a question he did not like. He has tried to force me out of his house before because he felt like I was being a bitch because I did not feel like editing his paper while he texted in the other room. If I ever spent time with my friends, he would get extremely pissed and mad if I do not text/call him right away when I am with him, demanding that I answer him or hell will be unleashed.\n\nThe topping on the cake is when one day we do not talk as much and he sends me a passive aggressive text saying, \"Oh looks like you have an attitude today since you did not bother texting or calling. Thanks a lot.\" even though I told him that I will be hanging out with family all day. I remind him that texting and calling is a two way street and he could have easily reached out if he wanted to talk to me. He erupts over text message virtually breaking up with me saying, \"Good luck finding better. I am done with your sass and attitude. While I am in (insert city here) being successful, you will be crying in (insert city) all alone and pathetic.\" \n\nBasically I just silently blocked him because I was beyond hurt that anyone who claims to love me would say that. I believe he was surprised that I just did not respond because this week has been nothing but apologies and declaration that he can not live with out me. That I am the best girlfriend ever. That he will change. That he will do anything to fix this. And I told him no. I feel horrible. This is my second relationship and I have never broken up with someone.

I am for sure attending NMU this coming year, but I was toying with the idea of transferring to U of M. I'm confident that I can get in, I have a very good GPA, already had internship at lit mag, etc. I was thinking of applying this fall and transferring my junior year. This summer I'm living in Ann Arbor with my sister, so I already sort of know the city and I do like it here, but I also like it in the U.P. If I transferred I would miss things like camping, hiking, snowboarding, etc. on the weekends. Plus, all of my friends are at NMU, and I would have to start all over trying to make new friends at U of M, which is especially hard coming in as a junior. I know a handful of the writing professors at NMU (Which is the degree I'm going into), but the thing is, a degree from U of M is more respected and looks better than one from NMU. I think that I would be more challenged if I transferred, and perhaps have more opportunities as it is a much larger school. I'm stuck on what to do. I love it at NMU, the city, atmosphere, professors, my friends....but then again, I wonder if I would gain more experience/better education and further my potential if I transferred. I realize I have a lot of time to make this decision, and I plan on applying either way, just to have the option, but I was just wondering what you guys' thoughts on the matter are.

It has been 10 months and sadly I just don't think I feel the same way I did before after all this time. She is my best friend and she comes from a rather broken home; her mom is clinically depressed and her father has anger management issues and sometimes verbally abuses her (never physically). She constantly tells me about her home problems, how she feels like falling apart all the time and wants to hurt herself or hit something and every time she texts me it gets worse and I just can't deal with it anymore. I tell her that it makes me angry to hear this, and in turn makes her feel worse that I feel bad. I can only do so much for her, I tell her joining the Air Force or Navy would be a better option than suffering at home (her father was in the Navy and is used to moving a lot).\n\nShe doesn't have a whole lot of friends and I'm probably the main person in her life who is there to support her. These last few months we have argued several times and she has noticed that I am losing interest, fast. Every time the subject arises she sends me about 100 texts saying how sad this makes her and how depressed she would be if we broke up, but I feel there is no point in going out anymore. She's the sweetest person to me and I love her so much as a friend but that feeling just isn't there anymore and it's unfair to her and I that I can't truly return her affections...

We both had our issues, mine depression and hers an inability to communicate without shouting and shutting me down.  The problem is that shortly before the crisis point I believe that my wife gained a new online friend which she was not open about.  For the first time since I've known her (we've been together almost ten years) she started to hide her phone from me and there were multiple other times where she acted out of character.  At the time I feared the worst and that sent me into an anxiety spiral that left me unable to eat or sleep for weeks, I was a mess.\n\nI needed help and sought counselling, thanks to that I was able to confront her on these issues, but each time she denied everything and I felt like things were still unresolved.  I asked her to work with me to prove one way or another so that we can move on but each time ended in arguments.\n\nSince then we both completed individual counselling courses and things have improved a thousand times.  We're both committed to the relationship, we communicate better (but not as well as I think we should, but way better than before) and our lives should be getting back on track.  However all the time I've been thinking about this person.  I don't believe that there's a physical relationship, but I cannot understand why it stays secret.  I know she loves me, I know she's in it for the long term so it bakes my noodle why she would want to hurt me so much.\n\nI so desperately want to believe her and feel like a terrible person doubting her like this.  Some days I wonder whether I'm just making it all up in order to find a magic \"fix\" so that she can admit it, explain why she did it and then we can both move on.  I keep trying to ignore my suspicions and move on myself, sometimes I managed a few weeks, sometimes a month but it doesn't seem to help.  Each time I confront her I'm unable to really get across my point and end up hurting us both.\nTL;DR:"}

We expected that Kickstarter might ask us to make changes prior to launch. We even expected that despite all our attention we might have missed something, and Kickstarter might deem our project ineligible. We did not expect this:\n\n>\"Your project has been declined.\n\n>Thank you for taking the time to submit your project. Unfortunately, >this isn't the right fit for Kickstarter. We receive many projects daily >and review them all with great care and appreciation. We wish you >the best of luck as you continue to pursue your endeavor.\n\n>Best, \n>Kickstarter\"\n\n \nThat's it? An auto-reply?\nThis is the entirety of the response from an organization that claims to support hard work and independent creativity as its primary mission? \n\nHow many others have invested countless hours in creating and refining their Kickstarter projects, to be met with the same indifferent dismissal?\n\nWe requested an appeal to the decision, but if the appeal is denied, with another canned response, that's it - case closed.\n\nSo, what do you think? Rumor has it Reddit has an appreciation of cats - and keen sense of justice. Is cutting/pasting generic replies incongruous with the values that Kickstarter purports to hold as a company? Or are we wrong to expect an answer that's even fractionally commensurate to the thought and attention that went into the project?\nTL;DR:"}

He is a wonderful man, we make each other happy, etc., etc.\n\nThe biggest issue that I am having, is that I believe he has undiagnosed depression, and have encouraged him to seek a professional opinion. He doesn't seem to think there is a problem, however, and has not made any efforts to get evaluated; furthermore, I don't believe he has any intention to do so. \n\nThis is troubling to me as we move towards marriage and living together. He has very low energy a lot of the time, can be irritable, has body aches, doesn't sleep well, and the thing that bother me the most is that sometimes when he is in a good mood, he'll suddenly lose all his energy and become very \"low.\" Like a mood and energy swing. Sometimes these \"swings\" are cause by triggers and sometimes they seem to be caused by nothing at all.\n\nI myself have diagnosed depression that I take medication for. I am also a licensed social worker with some experience in the mental health field, so to some extent, I know what I'm talking about, and I see all the signs of AT LEAST Dysthima ( mild depressive disorder ) present. I have absolutely no issues with the presence of a mental heath issue as I've got some of my own and understand them more than most; it's the lack of willingness to seek help that is distressing to me. I know that I will have a hard time moving forward in this relationship when he's not seeking to remedy this issue that is damaging to our relationship. He even admits that his \"swings\" hurt us as a couple. I just want him to get help and be happy, but he doesn't seem to share my desire for that. \n\nI'm wondering what to do in this situation, and I'm not sure if continuing to bring it up will make it better or worse. What would you do in my shoes? What would you want to hear if you were in his shoes?\nThoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated.\nTL;DR:"}

She is a pretty busy person, with cheerleading and all, and so am I with band and martial arts.  I know how to work around her schedule so she isn't too busy at the time to respond.  I will see that she is online on Skype, so I will send her a message just casually talking, and she will never respond.  I only try to talk to her every couple days to not be bothersome, but she eventually will literally stop talking to me.\n\nThen magically all of a sudden she is so happy to see me and wants to talk all the time, that is, until a couple months later when she ignores me again.

We traveled, visited each other long distance at school, and she even came with me to my sisters wedding. About 5 months ago, I was in almost a depression kind of way, and couldn't get excited about where I was and what I was doing. I think it also made me feel like our relationship was stagnant, and I broke up with her a couple of months later, since it was starting to make us both unhappy. It was still hard, because we still had good times, but I didn't want us to resent each other and date until we hated each other. I think were both unhappy about it, but saw the need/importance of breaking up. \n   Cut to now, 3 months later. I am about to start Nursing school, have moved into a new place and saw her again for the first time in a couple of months. We ended on pretty good terms, so we have been talking since the breakup but this was the first time we have hung out. And even though I had had doubts about my choice, I have been able to rationalize my move- until last night. We got dinner, she helped me get some new stuff for my place, and came back and talked for a long time until she had to go home. I got all of my old, good feelings. How she makes me come out of my shell, think in healthier ways, and just makes me smile for stupid reasons. I am really starting to miss her, and I know deep down I still love her. \n   I want to tell her, but I don't know if it's fair, but I'm also afraid that the longer I wait the more likely it is she will move on.

I understand why this would make her upset but it still sucks to be completely shut out over saying that. \n\nWe ended up getting in a bunch of mini-fights and silent treatments.

Obviously, a few days later they came and did another inspection, found nothing amiss, so they verbally told us they would be coming in to inspect it once every couple of weeks.

I suspect they have been coming in unannounced but have no proof of this. However, on October 3rd, they placed an eviction notice on a loose sheet of paper on the outside of my door stating my apartment was unsanitary. They could not have known it was unsanitary unless they came in to  my home while I was away, at which point they should have left a notice in plain sight. I have received no such notice except for the one in may and the eviction which did not say they had entered in any way, shape, or form.

I am trying my hardest to drop back to around 180 (my ideal weight for myself) but am getting frustrated and upset that the scale doesn't move, and have been very unhappy seeing photos of myself looking larger again. My question is, is there something I am doing wrong? \n\nI checked my BMR, added in my moderate amount of working out, and the calculators say I have a BMR around 3200 Cal, that seems very high to me, but either way I try to keep myself under 1700. I eat mostly home cooked meals, don't drink anything but water, teas (unsweetened) and a little juice. Me and my wife watch what we eat and try not to put alot of processed foods in our bodies and try to cook healthy meals. I would love if someone could give me some insight on anything I may be doing wrong.\nTL;DR:"}

I would then of course be financially responsible for all the bills, credit cards, groceries, rent, insurance, etc.\n\nI've budgeted it out and we could make it work financially but we would have to make a major lifestyle change and I don't know if that would help or hinder her depression.\n\nAnd yes, she has been diagnosed anti-depressants in the past during her college years and as she's told me \"she's never felt like that up until recently.\"\n\nI've told her that if she feels the need to see a doctor about it I'd support her and even go with her if she needs to.\nWhen she rants or cries about her job/life now I want to say something to help her but I just lately have been sitting there in silence feeling like whatever I say is just going to make matters worse.\nTL;DR:"}

We have been struggling a bit over the last month, and shes just been just dealing with stuff. I've done my best to be patient, understanding, and supportive when she allows me, but it was getting to be a bit much. Then, last week she started saying things like, \"I feel like you don't understand me, I feel like were total opposites sometimes\" and my favorite, \"You shouldn't put so much effort into the relationship, cause for all you know it could fail\". That was a red flag for me, so I voiced my concern and she said that something has been bugging her to where she just doesn't feel anything emotionally; not just in the relationship, but with life in general. At this point, I was a bit exhausted, and a little more than upset. I calming told her that I thought we should take a small break so she could re-assess the relationship and figure out what has been bothering her. She was very civil, and helped me as  I packed my things and hugged me before I left. This was exactly a week ago, and since then, I've been productive, and i've been working on myself. I hit the gym, reconnected with old friends, been cooking and cleaning my apartment; I feel like a pretty well rounded guy! But still, I cant shake this lonely feeling I get. I've gotten a handful of texts at best (most of which I initiated). I understand that with breaks, you're not supposed to talk a lot, but this radio silence is really getting to me. I miss her, and I love her, and to be honest i'm a little worried. I knew she was independent, but it almost feels like i'm single again, and I cant say that I like it. I guess i'm wondering what I should do. Should I confront her and ask her how she feels?\nTL;DR:"}

It's a salaried position and I earn about a day of sick time per month, so I only have two sick days saved.\n\nA few weeks ago, I found out I was pregnant. I scheduled an abortion for Friday, 9/9. At the clinic, they couldn't find the fetus via ultrasound, which means that I either had a miscarriage without noticing/bleeding (and the tests still show positive) or I have an ectopic pregnancy. I have a couple more urgent appointments to figure this out this week--and they're actually not scheduled yet! I have to call radiology tomorrow morning--so that will require being late to work at an indeterminate time, or, if I do have an ectopic pregnancy, missing a couple days or longer.\n\nHow do I tell my boss? She is very nice and understanding, but this is an intimate issue. I really don't mind if she knows  about it (in fact, that might make it less awkward for me), but I don't know if it's appropriate to tell her. How vague or explicit should I be in my email? How do I handle the fact that I have no idea how many days (or when) I will miss work? In addition, this is a very busy week with a few important, long-awaited meetings and I feel really bad. Also, I technically don't have enough sick days saved up after taking Friday off (complicating matters, a few coworkers asked why I was taking the whole day off on Friday, and I told them it was for an MRI arthrogram of my hip, lol).\n\nThere is an HR department but I do feel more comfortable telling my supervisor the details than them--though I suppose they'll have to know eventually.

The litter was found two Saturdays ago (9/20). Two were adopted by separate friends, and our two remained at the coworkers until this past Monday (9/29).\n\nThe coworker had taken them to the vet last Tuesday (9/23). They had full examinations, and were given medicine for worms. The vet said that they were too young to have any vaccinations until their immune system fully develops, and to bring them back in 4-5 weeks. They had \"flea dust\", and the coworker bathed the two kittens in dawn dish detergent. Otherwise, the vet had said that they were both healthy.\n\n______\n\nFast forward to us having the two kittens. We've been containing them to the bathroom during the day while at work, feeding them before and after. The coworker had very recently switched them over to canned wet formula, and gave us a few cans to use.\n\nA. One (or both, unsure) has been having diarrhea, which the other seems to lick. She's gone twice on my bed, and once on her towel. Is there a special food that I should be using for kittens of this age that won't lead to diarrhea?\n\nB. After washing the two of them to de-diarrhea their fur, we discovered that they both have fleas. We spent the rest of the night using tweezers to remove the fleas, and drying them. I plan on getting a flea comb, bathing the two of them of in Dawn dish detergent, and washing all of my sheets and clothes. We have hardwood floors, should I still vacuum? \n\nC.

So naturally i sought out a significant other to make me feel less lonely. It didn't really solve the problems but she was extremely supportive throughout the whole thing, and a year later i was completely over the anxiety and depression. Over that year i developed a lovely relationship with her, and i learned to care for her deeply. \n\nHowever, once my anxiety and depression ended, i started to notice that i was having less fun with her, i was more eager to do the things i was doing before anxiety and depression took over. Less eager to do things with her. So it's quickly turned into me being sort of annoyed when im with her. On top of all this we both live very busy lives, we are both art majors at a school in Vermont, and constantly have work to do where we are only seeing eachother a couple times a week. \n\nI've been considering asking for a break, to really sort things out. And this is where my question comes into play... Can you have a break like this, especially one that will be super one sided (she will not want to do it, she's really attached) and go back to having a normal relationship after?

Generally, I'd say our relationship is strong - open communication, related hobbies, and great sex. \n\nHowever, there is one giant, glaring issue that has again reared its head tonight: I suspect my girlfriend has a problem with alcohol. \n\nIt's not about the consistency of consumption - she doesn't drink each day or anything like that; instead, when she does drink, she goes overboard. Everytime. She becomes hostile, aggressive, and just really mean. Awful person to be around. She is REALLY awful towards me, especially. \n\nTonight she did the same at a family gathering (her family, not mine, and hers are more accepting of drinking, but her parents did talk to me about her behaviour). I was late-ish to this thing; when I arrived, she was already very drunk, couldn't talk without slurring, and was exhibiting some pretty obnoxious behaviour. \n\nShe told me to \"fuck off\" and \"just leave\" [I don't think I did anything to deserve this. I wasn't really supporting her actions, but that's still an unreasonable escalation on her part]. I'm used to this by now, so I can deal with it, but it's coming to a point where I feel the need to talk to her about her actions while drunk. \n\nThe problem that will probably occur is that she's very defensive about it; I've tried to broach the subject with her before and it has only come to a enormous fight. It is a VERY touchy subject.\nTL;DR:"}

And he's not exactly innocent of problems either, he was talking to other girls and sexting with them, but I've sense forgiven him for that, because I was partly to blame because of my depression.

We'll have been apart for ten weeks and things have been going as good as they can given the eight hour time difference and our extremely busy schedules. We talk about three times a week and email almost everyday - snail mail and love letters included. Our relationship is really ideal as a whole, however...\n\nWithin the last couple weeks, I have developed an abhorrence of said internship. My girlfriend, on the other hand, absolutely loves hers. I'm sourced in the middle of nowhere in Northern Germany with nothing but work, exercise, and beer to occupy my drab existence. In other words, I'm bored to tears and having an awful time. I'm so glad my girlfriend is loving her time in Colorado - the only thing she says missing is me, but this does little to reconcile my situation. \n\nThe disparity in our experiences is difficult for me. Hearing about her wonderful experience makes me happy for her and I really am. I of course am jealous of the awesome time she is having; however, this form of jealousy is only temporary, I realize. I don't want to subconsciously berate her time in Colorado in the form of buzz killing. How should I go about slogging through the next four weeks? I try very hard to keep positive when we communicate, and it is sometimes hard to be happy for her when I am not. I just feel stuck and the passing of time is unhelpfully slow. How do I work through this over the next month without being a major buzzkillington on my girlfriend?\nTL;DR:"}

I had an argument about this a while ago, and the opposing side said that you can learn languages just by being exposed to it and that your brain makes connections and learns the language (said this with an example: a man holding out a bag of salt, talking. Your brain makes a connection that the man is talking about the bag of salt and therefore you understand every single word he is saying if you are exposed to this repeatedly). I can't imagine this possibly happening. You learn languages by using another language you are already fluent in as a tool (for example, I know what a Korean word means because I know what it is in English).\nTL;DR:"}

Well, there's free bread that we serve to the customers as they sit down. Usually after cleaning tables, there's still some bread left over, which waiters, waitresses, and table bussers snack on in the kitchen. \n\nI really love that bread (until now), and I'd always grab a big wad of it and try to swallow it. It usually works fine, sometimes I struggle to get it down, but 99% of the time it was fine. \n\nUntil Now. I was in a hurry, so I grabbed a bit too much and squished it up and ate it all. Big mistake. I immediately realize, 'Oh shit, it's stuck. I'm choking!\". I try swallowing - Stuck. I try coughing it up - Stuck. I immediately knew I fucked up.\n\nI ran to the waiter, Rosario, and I said with a slightly muffled voice, as my throat was blocked with bread with the same density as iron, \"Rosario! I'm choking! Help me!\"\n\nSo Rosario pats me on the back, and then tries the Heimlich Maneuver on me. It doesn't work. My boss took me back into the kitchen and we got several people to try it on me. It didn't work. I say in front of the trash can for about 5 minutes, crying, spitting, and seeing my life flash before my eyes as I wait for 911 to arrive. \n\nThey were relatively quick, but it felt like forever. They took me out to the ambulance, meanwhile, one of the waitresses drove to my house to tell me parents I was choking. My dad drove up to the restaurant seconds after I threw the piece of bread up. \n\nSo my throat is still sore, I have a big headache from all the screaming I was doing, and I probably won't consume bread ever again. At least, not all at once. \n\nThe moral of this story: Chew your food\nTL;DR:"}

He and his friend are avid gamers. They aren't obsessed, but enjoy playing together several times a week. My husband's friend brought up the possibility of them going to PAX East next year. When my husband first suggested going, I kind of grumbled about it. I'm not that big of a gamer anymore compared to when we started dating. I looked at the venues they had this past year, and it didn't really interest me. I told him if he wanted to go he could, but I didn't really get a response out of him. \n\nI thought it over for a couple of days and thought of a compromise. I have never been to NYC, and I always wanted to go. My compromise was that I travel with him and his friend to Boston for PAX. Then, I can take a train to NYC for a day and night. Visit museums, see the sites, and eat at a few good places. The next day I would come back to Boston, and join them for the third day of PAX. My husband doesn't like the idea. He either wants me to go to the entire PAX or we won't go at all. He says he wants to spend time with me, and I understand, but I would be miserable, bored, and grumpy the entire time. I can put on a happy face and pretend to enjoy it for his sake for a while, but not for three days! I know I would end up bringing him and his friend down when they should be enjoying themselves. \n\nHow do I approach my husband and convince him to go enjoy the event without having to be glued to my side the entire time?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Reddit, help me settle an important debate: Would you hang on and watch The Simpsons if it's format changed so that the characters \"aged\" for the remaining seasons?\nPOST: Ok, so Reddit, can we have a discussion about The Simpsons right now?\n\nMy boyfriend proposed this idea earlier tonight. He had a couple of drinks beforehand. \n\nSo, say The Simpsons is getting toward the end of its life, right? My boyfriend says that the writers should consider starting to age the characters in real time through the end of the series. Like, season to season, Bart and Lisa should be advancing in school, Homer and Marge get older, etc. This way the writers could \"keep things fresh\" and always have new material since the relationships between the characters would have to change as they age. This would be groundbreaking and fascinating to watch both because it is:\nA) A huge change so late into a TV series &\nB) The only cartoon (to my knowledge-I haven't had cable in years) in which all the characters age and we could identify with them like the family from Full House.\t\t\n\nI disagree with the whole idea completely. I think the writers are still doing just fine and that over the years, changes in the show's approach are obvious but not so much so that they alienate too many of their viewers. Furthermore, they've maintained an audience for 22 years without any wild changes to the set up (with perhaps the exception of killing off Maude) why change for change's sake? I feel that if the writers of The Simpsons were age its characters and announce it to the world, a lot of people will see it as a \"jumping the shark\" scenario.\nTL;DR:"}

She broke off her engagement. The day after she did, she asked me to drive down to see her (roughly and 8 hour round trip) , so I did. I got there and picked her up from her apartment, and on the way out of her complex she called her ex-fiance and told him she was out of the apartment, so he could come get his stuff. So, she said she wanted to go see a movie. We get there, I buy our tickets, and pretty much as soon as the movie starts she asks me to take her home. I didn't do anything, no touching, or kissing, or anything. We haven't talked since, and only exchanged a few text messages. This girl was my first love, and since we started talking again, I've been feeling myself getting more and more attached. She's mentioned the same thing to me. So, should I be concerned with this radio-silence? Should I reach out to her, or give her space? I've never been in this situation, and I can only imagine how difficult it must be for her. Ultimately, I just want her to be happy. Preferably with me, but if not, that's cool too, so long as she's content. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice/help.\nTL;DR:"}

We meant to go out for a movie a while ago, but bad timing but a hold on that. However, when seeing her recently (after the holidays) I realised there was still something there. She also mentioned our post-poned date.\n\nOther information: \n\nI am 19. Lauren is 23, Sarah is 21. Sarah is an exchange student so she will be gone next semester. However, I normally go away for a few months in summer, so I'm not sure if I would keep a hypothetical relationship going for that time with Lauren, especially if it's new.\n\nSo the situation I am in is the following:\n\nI'm a little new to 'dating'. I've only had one longer relationship before (if you can call 7 months 'longer'). Other hook-ups had an expiration date on them, mostly due to traveling or so.\n\nNaturally I feel a little weird dating one chick and taking another on a date.

Our birthday present to her turned out to be life-saving surgery.\nPOST: Last night, our German Shepherd Dog was acting a little funny for a few minutes and abruptly threw up.  We let her outside, where she wandered about for roughly twenty minutes, trying to vomit - unsuccessfully - several times.  She also laid down a couple times, but almost immediately got back up.  She was clearly uncomfortable.\n\nMy wife speculated that it might be bloat - a condition where the stomach becomes bloated by excessive gas, and twists.  We checked a couple of our GSD books and the symptoms matched up perfectly.  Off to the emergency vet clinic, where x-rays confirmed that her stomach and spleen were twisted.  The vet offered two options:  surgery or euthanasia.  Though they quoted us between two and three thousand dollars for the former option, the latter just wasn't acceptable.  \n\nThey explained that without treatment, death was very likely within a few hours, and it would be very painful for the dog. So we signed off on the surgery.  They further explained that the fact that we got her in so quickly after the initial symptoms made it easier for them to treat, with a far greater chance of success. \n\nAfter a couple hours, the vet reported that the surgery had gone well - though there was some redness and swelling of the stomach and spleen, both returned to normal after the procedure.  They also performed a procedure that I can best describe as stapling the stomach in place in the hope of preventing further occurrences.\n\nAs of this morning, they report she is doing quite well and we can likely take her home tomorrow morning.\nTL;DR:"}

She is amazing. We hit it off incredibly well. She wanted to take it super slow, which I was totally ok with.\n\nAfter many dates and a lot of sexual tension (which was incredibly enjoyable) clothes finally came off. And they came of nearly all at once. Things happened fast. And then this happened: her breasts are not huge, but on her frame they did seem on the large size. She is super athletic, and I can't deny I found her curves, despite her lean physical appearance, quite attractive. She doesn't wear revealing clothes at all. And we had not gone beyond holding hands until the clothes all came off.\n\nShe has implants. I lost my erection, and I felt like an asshole. It totally caught me by surprise. I had never dated someone with implants before. She is young and hasn't had kids. As far as I know, she is also healthy. But I am now really curious why she chose to go through surgery. I didn't bring it up yet. If she chose this because of insecurities, I don't want to make things worse by being tactless or insensitive. Also, I like breasts, small, medium, big, saggy, lopsided, dark, light, pink, brown, whichever. It doesn't matter to me because it is the body that belongs to the person I am dating. I don't quite yet think of implants as being part of the body. And I am confused (and even feel sort of guilty) about my reaction. And my loss of sexual attraction....\nTL;DR:"}

He and the rest of his family went to go see the show last week. He claims that when the girl playing Ariel came out on stage, he had a quote, \"split-second\" attraction to her, thought her to be \"some kind of hot...well, not hot, just attractive\" and then promptly started to freak out because he was grossed out as to why he would think that. He spent the rest of the play uncomfortable, and trying to figure out why he even felt that way in the first place. \n\nAfter long discussion if him freaking out and me trying to wrap my head around this, he tells me that he has never felt like this towards a younger girl before and he wasn't even sure why he felt attraction to her in the first place, as he was in the back of the auditorium and couldn't really even see what she looked like. He assumes that it had to be a result of her in costume - a body suit under the bikini and tail. However, he says he is still confused because the girl (obviously) didn't have a body (ie, boobs, butt). \n\nNow he confined this to me, and I'm having a very hard time with this. How could he at almost 21 feel an attraction to a middle school aged girl? I feel disgusted and conflicted and I honestly want to help him through this as well. But how big of a red flag is this?

He's submissive and really nice! \n\nAfter some time hanging out, one day he told me he has a huge foot fetish, and the he would love to adore my feet (kiss/caress them, etc). I'm not really into foot fetish at all, but as a Dom I was like \"okay, maybe I should just let him do it some time, it's not like I hate it\".

I was so excited and anxious about it, that I started preparing myself that exact day: I shaved and got a haircut. The following day, I bought some new lingerie and a collar. And today, about 3 hours before the meeting, I decided to take proper care of my feet, since I really wanted to please this guys fetish. \n\nAfter taking a relaxing bath, I exfolliated and massaged my feet, and painted my toenails. At some point I thought that pouring some vanilla scented moistening body lotion on my feet was a good idea. I was so wrong. \n\nTime passes by, we meet and have a couple of drinks, and then we come over to my place to start with the kinky stuff. \n\nI want you to imagine this: we go to my bedroom, I put a collar & handcuffs on him and make him undress me with his mouth only. The task was going well until he took my shoes off. He just stopped, stared at me, said the safe word and said \"I can't breathe, I'm sorry\".\n\nFor some weird reason, the lotion kind of... fermented? I have no fucking clue.

[x-post from r/sex]\nPOST: I (23F) have been hooking up with my friend's roommate (30M) for about a month and a half. When it first started happening, we talked and both decided we don't want a relationship. But it seems to me, lately, that things are not as casual as just hooking up. For example, he wants me to stay the night after and sometimes ill sleep over and we won't even have sex (which kind of frustrates me since my sex drive is super high lately). We aren't really affectionate when other people are around, mostly because a whole bunch of us hang out together and neither of us need anyone nosing into our business, which is totally fine with me. But inevitably, other guys will talk to me and pay attention to me, because they think I'm single. Often, the guy I'm hooking up with will mention me talking to some other guy...sometimes he'll say something a few times about it. \n   \n Also, he's told me how much he likes me (in fact, he says he likes me too much and needs to be careful) but he thinks we wouldn't work as a relationship...he's also said he thinks I'm too good for him. I've talked to a few of my guy friends about this, and they've all said the same thing: that he wants more but doesn't know how to approach it. \nSo, a few questions. Is he jealous of the other guys I talk to? Is he sending me mixed signals or am I just reading too much into things?\nThanks in advance! Also, x-post to r/sex\nTL;DR:"}

These two were very close, with a much deeper bond than a regular father/daughter bond. My girlfriend is devastated. She goes to a grief counselor but it seems to get worse day by day.\n\nHere are some specifics to our situation that may be helpful... My girlfriend gets really sad when she thinks about how I never got the chance to meet her dad. This is a particularly large source of grief for her, and one she talks about often. Also, she LOVES to talk about him. She says that his name is music to her ears, and even though it makes her sad, she loves talking about him and reminiscing about him. She thanks me every time I bring him up. \n\nShe has moments where she is just honestly hysterical. Hearing her cry just breaks my heart so much, I simply can't bear it. I would give anything to trade places with her. During these times she is just inconsolable. \n\nThings I have been doing/planning on doing so far: talking about him with her and letting her know how much I desperately want to be a part of her relationship with him, since I never got to meet him in person. I signed us up to run a marathon together that benefits cancer (she is a runner and has always wanted to run a marathon). I have made arrangements to visit her over the summer (we will be long distance) to visit her dad's grave with her for the first time on his birthday. \n\nThank you all so much.\nTL;DR:"}

Not sure how I feel about that, what to do?\nPOST: So I live in the US and have been in a long-distance relationship with my Korean bf for about a year. We met online and have met up irl once, a few months ago. We decided that it would be best to close the distance as soon as possible, which will be in a few months' time. We've decided that it would be best if I could get a working holiday visa for Korea, and spend close to a year there while he finishes his degree. Then, we plan on moving back to the US so that I can get started on my graduate degree.\n\nWhile in Korea, he wants us to live at his parents' house, which he is currently living in while he studies, until we move to the US. I have reservations about this, which I have made clear to him - I'm fine with spending a few weeks at his parents' house, but anything longer than that makes me nervous. To be clear, his parents are completely fine with me living with their family; even though we've never met in person, I think they've seen that I've been a positive influence on their son and appreciate me for that, and according to my bf, they're very hospitable people.\n\nRegardless, I'm the type of person who feels guilty for inconveniencing or imposing upon anyone, even if in reality that might not even be the case. I would feel really uncomfortable staying with them for such a long period of time. My bf seems to think it won't be an issue, and perhaps it won't be, but I still think it would be a better idea to move into an apartment together after a few weeks. Sure, it would be more costly (which I think bothers him), but we're both adults who will be working, so that shouldn't be the deciding factor. \n\nWhat do you think we should do? Also, when we are at his parents' house (for however long that might be), how can I contribute/repay them? They've already said that they don't want me to do anything, other than maybe buy milk when they're running out, small stuff like that.\nTL;DR:"}

(This does not include fantasies, but actual action, or desire for real action in this way)\n\nThe reason I ask the question is because I know it is hypocritical, but I do think in a guy's mind it is a different thing for a girl to have sex with 2 guys than it is for a guy to have sex with 2 girls.  If a girl had done that, it seems pretty damn slutty, and she would no longer be an option for long-term commitment -- short-term fun maybe.

I really like being around her and we always have a great time together.\n\nShe said that she feels the same way, but here is where the catch comes in.

She says that she likes this guy as well, but isn't really sure where they stand, and he doesn't seem that serious.\n\nI think I set off a chain of events here where I essentially told her that I want to get serious, but wouldn't be comfortable with doing that if she was still seeing another guy.  I think I put her under a bit of stress, because that chain of events ends in her picking one guy over the other.  We last spoke a few days ago, and I told her that I would respect her decision either way, but felt like I was getting mixed signals.  She said that she needed some time to think about it, and I told her to take some time and let me know what she thinks.\n\nIs there anything else I should do at this point?

Immediately, everyone wants to say its because they're idiots, but I'd wager there's more to it than that.\nPOST: I knew a guy who wore his pants like that, and he was not someone I considered to be very concerned with his image. He said it was just so much more comfortable that way, and he can't figure out how people wear them normally. I tried to wear it low but it didn't work for me.\n\nMy theory? Get ready, its a weird one. When people are stressed they take that stress out on certain muscles by flexing it constantly without realizing it. Certain cultures seem to favor stress-muscle-areas more than others. White American culture seems to take everything out on their lower back, pooching their stomachs out and creating an overly alert torso.\n\nThese lowered pants belong to a counter culture that, I believe, has complete relaxation of the lower back as one if its principles (though, probably completely unsaid). The stress they feel, I believe, is transferred more to the shoulder/upper torso area. I suspect that the posture formed by this counter reaction to common tense-back posture makes wearing pants like that much more desirable.\nTL;DR:"}

(He has had feelings for me before, but never as strong as mine were.) I'm still feeling ok about my decision to sleep with him. The fact of the matter is, we have the best sex. He satisfies me more than anyone has ever been able to. But other than continuing to go on dates with other men, how can I make sure my feelings stay how they are right now? I am just looking for tips, anything will help. I know my responses will probably be like \"just stop sleeping with him,\" but I'm looking for other alternatives than that because what we have is so casual and so chill.\nTL;DR:"}

I was in first going about 20 meters from the finish and Steve was about 10 meters behind me. We were both in our closing sprints and it was clear that I had beaten him. Now the finish line was on the right side of a fence, but one could also run on the left side, around the fence, then to the finish, which is what happened in the fun run that was earlier that day. Going to the fence I was unsure of which side to go, but I was pretty sure I should go left. But then I see a guy in the crowd motioning to go right, so that's what I do. Suddenly I hear my coach yell \"I_love_gummy_bears, what are you doing!?\" So I quickly turn around to go to the other side of the fence. However, that area was muddy and I was wearing flats, not spikes. So I slipped and fell in the mud. I got up and sprinted to the finish, but by this time Steve had gotten ahead of me. Steve only got me by about 0.4 seconds, but I still got second place. But I PRed with 17:36, which was nice.

I've been with my girlfriend now for about a year and a half, and it's currently my senior year. As college comes ever so closer, I've been wondering what the right move would be regarding my girlfriend.\n\nLet's be honest. I plan on attending college. Even if I decide to go to community college for two years, then off to a university, I realize that the distance between us will be difficult for the relationship. I've tried the whole \"long-distance relationship\" thing, but it never worked for me (like many others). I've also come to the realization that the chances we would get married are slim.\n\nTo add more information: There is another girl that I've flirted with since about freshman year. She's always flirted back, so I assume it's very possible that I could/would hook up with her. I've always felt very strongly about her and come into close contact with her often.\n\nSo I'm at a crossroad. In one situation, my girlfriend is everything I could ask for. There's not really anything about her I would change. (Often times, I've felt we were very alike. I've wondered if it'd be more beneficial to date someone who isn't quite as like me.) She's always been there for me, and I'm sure would be for a long time to come. On the other hand, being in college far-off and trying to make a relationship work seems difficult. Also, you never know who either one of you may meet.\n\nSo,\nTL;DR:"}

My grandfather requires oxygen, blood glucose testing, and is basically like a kid again. He can't cook for himself, he is still unstable on his feet. He is also starting to show signs of dementia. In my opinion, he needs an assisted living facility, but his insurance is crap and neither my aunt nor my mom can afford to pay for it. Has anyone been through this before and have some insight as to how to get my grandfather the help he needs? We are in Maryland if that helps. Does anyone know of any programs, assistance of any kind? He is a veteran as well.  Any insight/advice would be greatly appreciated!\nTL;DR:"}

However when he made a series of pieces based on real life \"romantic moments\" (such as conversations by the lake, or picnics in the woods), half of the pieces were based on their moments and the other half were based on ours. The pieces based on their moments were more positive and happy than the ones based on the ones with me. Mutual friends who saw the series in his exhibition noticed this as well, so I'm not exaggerating.\n\nThe thing is, they were only together for a month or so while we have been together for five years.\n\nI tried to ask him why he chose some negative memories for the pieces based on us as opposed to five years of happy ones to choose from... but he got angry and accused me of being jealous and trying to censor/change his art. I'm not jealous. I'm definitely not jealous of *her*. I do wish the happy ones were based on me, but I'll keep that thought to myself. \n\nAnyway, after I told him how I felt about the series, I left the subject alone. It is his art and I have no say in what he does with it. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I (16F) may be pregnant\nPOST: Hi, okay so I may be jumping to conclusions but I'm really scared right now and I need advice.\n\nSo I am 16, female, going to be a senior in the fall, and I'd say I'm an above average kid, with a 2200 SAT and want to study engineering. I've been dating the same boy since freshman year, we're the same age and he's my best friend. We have a wonderful relationship and are close but not attached at the hip like some kids my age. Last summer, I lost my virginity to him after a long time discussing it. We had sex only about 4 times after that. The most recent of those times were May 28, where he did not come, and June 14, when he did. Both times we used a condom, and we were really careful with it.\n\nI usually get my period about the 20th of each month, so the past few days I've been really stressed out over it. However, I could very likely not be pregnant- I am an intense (like being recruited) runner, and I have recently upped my training a lot- I added an hour of swimming to my daily (4-8 mi) runs. I have been eating enough to keep up all the exercise, but maybe it has not been enough despite what I thought. But my mind keeps floating back to the idea that I'm pregnant... and I don't know what to do. My parents are crazy strict, so if I told them what I thought, my life could be over... and I dont want that. I'm scared and confused and I just need someone to help point me in the right direction with everything.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Dear AskReddit, I am at risk of losing my state scholarship award because over an obscure rule in the fine print, do you have any advice?\nPOST: So I'm currently in my fourth semester at community college in Tennessee. I've been receiving the state scholarship since I've been here and have been doing really well. However, this semester an issue came up when I was reapplying for said scholarship. I took a year off between High School and College, but since I graduated from high school a year early, my mother had me taking classes (just 1 for starters) at a different community college as part of an agreement, starting in the fall after I graduated. However, the following spring semester, I stopped attending because I had been working a lot and didn't really see the point of it at the time. Then in the fall semester after that I decided to commit to taking classes full time at my current school and that was a year ago.\n\nNow all of the sudden the financial aid office at my school is telling me that since I took that one class after graduating high school, and then technically \"dropped out\" the next semester, even though I was neither a full time student, nor receiving financial aid, I am technically ineligible for the state scholarship that I have been receiving for 3 semesters. The way around it is to go to the other school I went to and get a leave of absence, which has to go through an appeals process, and if it is approved then I can get the scholarship. The obvious problem with doing this is that my absence was not due to some serious problem in my life, and therefore I have no documentation that would support such a claim. As far as I know applying an appeal is my only option. I am not sure how strict they are in the appeals process. I want be careful about not getting into any sort of trouble, but I'm probably going to need to do some lying, or at least heavy exaggerating to win the appeal. I'm wondering just how careful I should be about this, and if anyone has been in a similar situation and might know of any other options I have.\nTL;DR:"}

We ended up going to a movie the very next night at her suggestion. Made plans to get together again the following weekend, but she kind of flaked and we didn't end up getting together, leading me to think she wasn't interested. She kept texting me, though, and we ended up getting dinner during the following week. Right after that date, she texted me to tell me how much she likes me, and every time we've spent time together we've gotten along *very* well... kissed multiple times but nothing more, but pretty obviously really enjoyed each other's company. Then, all of a sudden, her texting became more erratic, and the last time we were supposed to get together she strung me along with half-commitments before finally saying \"let's reschedule\" at the last minute. We've still been texting, albeit less regularly, and last night I decided to give asking her on a 4th date one more shot. She responded after I'd fallen asleep saying that she'd like to get together this week, as long as it's before Wednesday. I got back to her this morning with \"Ok, how about Tomorrow?\" No response...\n\nI'm not dumb -- I totally get that every signal she's sending basically says \"I don't want to hang out anymore, but I'm not willing to come out and say it.\" But given the fact that we've had fantastic chemistry every time we've been together, and she explicitly stated her positive feelings immediately after the last time we saw each other, am I crazy to keep trying? She also seemed flakey the weekend before our third date, so maybe it really is just her personality? I will say that her personality is quite different from any other girl I've dated - she's a little awkward and pretty blunt, which makes me wonder why she would lie about still wanting to see me (or about having liked me in the first place).

I like her a lot and she always tells me how much she likes me, and I really believe her. We haven't even had sex yet, but whenever we do anything I always initiate it. She seems to enjoy it and reciprocates my affection enthusiastically but if I didn't kiss her first or hold her hand first then I don't think we would kiss or hold hands for the duration of our hang outs.

The place we settled on is small, having only one bedroom, a living/dining space, kitchen, bath, and partially finished basement. I had some serious reservations about it, being a severe introvert who had lived alone previously, but he was in love with the place because it's a house, not an apartment, and it has a garage for all his bikes. I told him I wasn't too sure about it, but eventually agreed.\n\nNow, the fact that I ignored my concern is seriously starting to bite me in the ass. He doesn't work currently because he's going back to school. This means that during the summer, he does nothing. He spends pretty much the entire day lying on the couch playing things on tv and playing on his phone. If I want to be by myself, my options are either the bedroom or the basement. The bedroom is small and cramped, with nowhere to sit and no air circulation (door stays closed to keep cats out). The basement is filled with spiders and their webs, and I am paralyzingly arachnophobic. I've tried to tit up and clean it with a vacuum, but it's a real struggle and they just keep coming back anyway. Basically, neither room is comfortable for me to spend time in.\n\nNone of this seems like a big deal to him. He gets plenty of time to himself in the house because I work 8 - 10 hour shifts five days a week. I get no time to myself in the house. On my days off, he's there. When I get home from work at night, he's there. I don't want to be an asshole and tell him to get out or go somewhere else, because it's his house too and that's not fair. I figure this is my issue, so I should be the one to get out or go elsewhere. But I have nowhere to go. Not to mention the fact that when I end up sitting in the living room with him, he takes up the whole couch because he wants to lie down instead of sit and I end up shoved all the way to the edge with his feet on me.

We're now both pretty moderate, both politically and religiously.\n\nAs you can imagine, this hasn't gone over too well with her family.  The reactions have been everything from apathy to thinly-veiled contempt and resentment.  Consequently, it has grown exceedingly difficult to have a relationship with these people when they think I'm some sort of evil incarnation.  Correspondence no longer addresses issues of work, life, and family, but chapters from fundamentalist literature and long persuasive essays.\n\nNow, I've always been exposed to people with different beliefs from mine.  It's usually not a huge issue: They believe X, I believe Y, and we move on.  How's the family, hope work is going well, etc.  We know not to bring up religion, politics, Windows vs Linux vs Mac, whatever -- all in the interest of the relationship.  In other words, **I'd rather be your friend than not, so to this end, let's not start a fight.**  This is how civilized, educated, intelligent people interact, is it not?\n\nBut for some reason, some of my in-laws don't see it that way.  It's black, or it's white, and so if I don't agree with them, then I'm wrong, misguided, and/or downright evil.  Given this, how can I foster a relationship with them?\n\nI know there are plenty of you out there with fundie in-laws, parents, siblings, and other family members.  What are your stories, and how do you go about having a relationship with them when they think you're the devil?  How did you convince them that even though you disagree on religion or politics that you can share a meal together and not let it digress into a fist fight?\nTL;DR:"}

How do I prevent puppy from adopting old dog's bad habits?\nPOST: Hey guys. I am picking up my new Norwegian Elkhound this weekend. I am living at home for the next two months until I move out into my own place, and from what I understand these are critical months in development for any puppy (he's 7 weeks old today).\n\nThe house he's coming into has an 8-9 year old Springer Spaniel named Duke. Duke is the ultimate hunting dog, smart as can be, but because of the lack of obedience training, the fact that he's a rescue and didn't develop with the family from a young age thinks he can do as he pleases....he also begs like crazy....100% food obsessed.\n\nDuke is free to roam, come and go in/outside as he pleases. The new puppy however will be kennel trained and obedience trained far beyond what Duke ever was.\nDuke is a free spirited hunting machine, probably because he spent 6 months on his own scrounging for all his own food in the wild before we adopted him, unfortunately it's his unending obsession with food that makes him such a good hunter.\nHe listens to everyone...but only if there's food. He does however see my father as his alpha because he trained him to hunt and listens to him regardless of food.\n\nElkies are already a tough dog to obedience train and the last thing I want is for Duke's bad habits to become ingrained in my dog at a young age.\nI would like the new puppy to pick up on Duke's hunting skills but not his constant obsession with food.\nAny suggestions? Note that the puppy and I will be moving out end of august.\nTL;DR:"}

I went through a serious of casual hookups before him, but he is my first serious, long-term relationship. We've had our ups and downs like every other relationship, but it's been good for the most part. He treats me well and I love him. Also of note, I have been faithful to him the entire time we have been dating and haven't once thought about being with another guy, physically or romantically. \n\nBut the other night, I was at a party for a friend's birthday and met a guy (21m). At first I just started talking to him to be friendly (we have a lot of mutual friends, but I hadn't met him personally before), but as the conversation went on I just felt like we really clicked. I'm normally pretty shy around new people, but it was just so easy with him. We talked for *hours* and I can't recall a time (at least recently) that I had such a great, in-depth conversation--not even with my boyfriend. I hate to say it but I couldn't help feeling attracted to him.  \n\nI left before anything could happen, but now I'm feeling very conflicted. I've never experienced feeling instantaneously comfortable/connecting with anyone like this (even my current BF has told me that I was really quiet / shy when we first met and it took me a while to warm up to him). To be honest, I'm curious to pursue this, but logically I know that would be wrong. If I really wanted to see if there was anything there with this guy, I know I would have to break up with my boyfriend. But it feels stupid to let go of a long-term relationship just because I feel like I maybe might be better off with someone else. On the other hand, I'm also wondering if the relationship maybe wasn't as strong as I thought it was, if I'm questioning what it would be like to be with someone else other than my BF... I feel like if you truly loved someone, you wouldn't be having those doubts--especially after two years.\nTL;DR:"}

We've been keeping up with all the seasons up 'til now. I watched the 1st episode of season 5, and remembered how intense it is. I decided I was gonna stop watching it with the group, because everytime I do, it puts me in a bad mood, and I act sour afterwards. I don't need to watch something that makes me feel/act that way.\n\nMy boyfriend was disappointed when I said I was gonna stop, because it's been a fun thing we do together as a group. I told him that I can't stomache the gore, and that watching the sex scenes with him and a bunch of other guys makes me feel weird. I told him it makes me feel especially uncomfortable watching him ogle and comment on Daenarys whenever she's on screen. (Come on, she is fuckin' hot, but I don't wanna be there for the boob commentary)\n\nHe said I was being too insecure--a statement I agree with but also feel justified in. Yes, the situation makes me feel awkward. I know and understand straight men to love naked women, which is why I haven't asked him to stop watching porn and I sure as hell won't ask him to stop GoT. I just don't wanna watch WITH him--I prefer not to see him ogling other women for an hour. Add to that being in the room with three other guys also enjoying the sex scenes; I've decided not to watch.\n\nDo you think I'm being too insecure? I went on to ask him if he would feel strange if the situation were flipped. I said, \"If we were with three other girls, watching a show that featured a lot of sweaty, naked men, would you feel awkward if all the girls were checking them out hardcore?\" He kinda shrugged and said, \"Yeah, but you're still being silly.\" We stopped talking after that. I feel like he doesn't really understand me but is just putting up with my reaction.\nTL;DR:"}

We agree we need to work more like a team, but just don't know how.

We decided to break it off in order to grant us time to study in college. She told me that it would be better for us because we'd have more time to study, because we'll be able to do stuff without feeling held back by the other, and because this relationship would be hard during that time. Her school is about a mile from mine. So we broke up, and this is what she wants.\n\nShe wants to just be friends. She wants to see me one last time before I go. During the school year, she told me that she'd visit me, and I told her the same. On top of that, she also mentioned how this doesn't have to be forever. Maybe when college passes, we will find a way to be together again.\n\nSo here I am. A couple of days have passed since the break. She texts me like it's normal, with happy faces and \"Haha\"s. However, I am in no emotional shape to be replying with those because I would be a liar if I did. We've been in a relationship for almost two and a half years. It's rough knowing that you were in love with a girl one day, and you're friends the next.\n\nI'm rambling, but my days have been filled with sorrow. All of this hurts especially at night. I won't lie - I want her back, but I know some things should be left the way they are.\n\nSo what is your suggestion?

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Is it safe to omit past job info on a job application?\nPOST: I'm about to start sending out apps for a second job, but I'd like to not mention a job I had last year. It was at an abysmal call center where I became deeply depressed over the course of a year and then ended up getting fired after snapping at one of the supervisors. \n\nExplanation: My primary job (the one I care about) is at a television station. Whenever there's severe weather, I have to go in. I'm essentially on call in these types of situations. There was a snowstorm that was practically shutting down the city. The call center refused to close. I called in to explain to them that I couldn't make my shift because I needed to be at the station. They said that I had to show up or else I'd be written up. So I pleaded my case for a while longer, until I got sick of it, called the guy a douchecanoe and hung up. The next day, I go in for my shift. They call me in to HR, tell me I'm fired for calling the guy a douchecanoe and escort me out of the building.\n\nIt has been about 6 months since the incident and I'd really rather not mention it to future employers. I know most employers need your social security number to do employment background checks and that they can't ask for your SSN on applications anymore. So can they still check on your past employment? Will they bother? Should I mention that job or not?\nTL;DR:"}

She pretty popular, good looking, and outgoing, whereas I'm more of a \"smaller group of close friends/likes to chill\" kind of guy. \nSo basically, she invites me over to her house and we make some shirts for our class election and then watch a movie. When I left she kissed me, and I probably looked like a total jackass because it was my first kiss and I didn't see it coming. The next day we go with a group of friends to a cookout, and then a party. We kind of hung out at the party, and we cuddled and slept in the same bed but didn't make out or anything like that. In the morning I gave her a kiss goodbye. Later that day we went to a dance (which she asked me to go to), and she pretty much ignored me the entire night. After the dance we went to a bonfire with a bunch of seniors (we're both juniors) whom she was friends with but I didn't really know any of them, and she continued avoiding me. She then went to a house party which I didn't go to because it was the same people, and I left without saying goodbye. I didn't text her or anything yesterday or today, but I feel like I need to do something. Help.\nTL;DR:"}

I own my own architecture firm so professionally I'm in a good place and have, I think anyway, a lot to offer a woman. \n\nI haven't dated since the divorce but a couple of weeks ago I went into the cell phone store to replace my daughter's iPhone.

(By \"quirky\" I mean I'm completely a dork in front of women I find attractive.) \n\nShe appeared pretty young but I have a baby face myself so I know it's hard to tell just by appearance.

Do any of you guys have this issue with it?\nPOST: Disclaimer: I'm not bashing the series here; there *are* times when I love it. But I need to bitch about the following things before I implode:\n\nThree books into the series I'm beginning to realize: I *still* don't care what happens to almost any of these characters. A Storm of Swords is generally considered the best of the series, but even this book just totally fails to hold my attention about fifty percent of the time. I'm becoming dreadfully tired of Martin's TV-show-pacing style of switching point of view as soon as any story line becomes interesting, and then skipping important details that he didn't feel like making part of the narrative, only to hint at them later. Instead of reading on, I find myself putting the book down and finding anything to distract myself with as soon as Jaime, Tyrion, or Jon's chapters end. Arya would be on that list too, but I'm nearly four hundred pages in and almost nothing has happened with her. Oh look, she's traveling. Several chapters later: cool, she met some people. Switch to different POV. Back to Arya, now she's traveling with them. A couple more chapters and, oh look, she's still traveling. Well that's just splendid.\n\nI think the real issue is that the series is 100% plot driven, with as little character development as I've ever seen in any good book. The fact that it still is a rather good book is kind of mind blowing, given the fact that most of the characters are exactly the same person in different circumstances (ahem... robb, jon, ned, davos, jorah, etc.). But alas, I have to find out what happens to some of them, and I'm too invested to quit. Will someone please tell me I'm not alone in feeling this way?

Cranking up the radio and leaving the bathroom door open has been the short fix, but my neighbors aren't appreciative of the noise. I'd like to be a little smarter about it and either construct or purchase a device that will fulfill any audiophile's shower sing-a-long needs.\n\nIf you know of a product or are savvy enough to have engineered something that works, please oh please share. I've googled it, I've searched Best Buy and other larger stores...but have yet to find a Shower Radio that can handle WiFi (or Bluetooth).\n\nThere HAS to be something out there - either prefabricated or a DIY project probably involving lots of caulk and milk jugs.\n\nIf you're thinking about providing ideas, first Thank You...I appreciate your help and ideas! Basic functionality should hopefully include some sort of wireless input from a WiFi router, PC or Mac (802.11g/n, Bluetooth,) or other external wireless transceiver with a 3.5mm audio jack. And, of course, it must be waterproof, battery-powered and be able to be hung on a standard shower head.\n\nUsing the replies I receive, I will attempt construction myself and post the results on r/DIY!\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I [25/m] starting to think she's [24/f] a narcissistic/codependent.\nPOST: She's my first official girlfriend. We moved in together quickly (after 2 months), and it's now been 6 months.\n\nShe says complimentary things to me when she is in a good mood, and generally treats me sweetly, but she pretty much always talks about herself and focuses on herself. For example, she can literally recount her day in fifteen minute intervals without listening to more than one sentence about mine. She never wants to go out and do things (like when we first got together) and takes life more seriously than I do, then it seems to be my job to comfort her all the time.\n\nIf she is feeling sad she demands that I comfort her or say nice things to her, which pressures me into making positive statements about the relationship that I do not genuinely believe. She talks about being together forever, but while I am fairly content with spending time with her, I just don't think the connection is that strong.\nI feel like I rushed into things because of the insecurity of having never been in a relationship, but now things are very serious, and it appears on the surface that things are going well.\n\nOther info: I am financially independent, with a career and an ivy league degree, good looking, and have supportive friends and family. I just have lacked confidence in forming serious relationships in the past (and you don't want to complain to your friends about the person you are with). I really just want to be alone again, which I am used to and enjoyed.\n\nSo, I feel like the obvious advice is to break up with her, but she is insecure and may feel betrayed. I feel like I am a bad person for breaking up without ever really expressing my feelings or a bad person for staying with her and pretending I think she is the one. How can I tell her she needs to change her personality fundamentally (e.g., taking a genuine interest in my life/interests) or that I am breaking up with her because I don't believe she is capable of that change?\nTL;DR:"}

My husband and I talk to each other via skype etc. He asked me if I had any previous relationships and I told him honestly that never in my life I had any interest towards the relationships before marriage (not allowed in our religion). I asked him too and he said he had 2 girl friends when he was in high school. I asked him if he had any in Canada as I don't have any concern with his past but just wanted to know but he replied no he had two when he was in his home town and that too not very vey serious one. \n\nHe is very sincere to me now and I trust him 100 % but few days back we exchanged our facebook passwords. He said he was stalking me and I felt good that he is concerned but when out of curiosity i opened his facebook inbox and read his old messages I got to know that he was in sexual relationship with a girl in 2009 there in Canada and that whole relationship lasted for less than 2 months. I wonder why dint he delete that conversation in which he and that girl have written details of their sexual activities after doing that. I am shattered.\n\n Our religion doesn't allow such things and we have to be virgin before marriage. I can't share it with ANYONE as it will give his bad impression. I always had framed him a decent guy with moral values. We ourselves haven't talked about sex and such stuff till now as I don't want to loose the attraction of proper wedding which we will have after my studies and paperwork. I can't respect him from my heart and can't talk to him properly. He is asking me what's the matter but I don't want to embarrass him either. \n\nWhat should I do? I never wanted my husband to be used by someone else before me and I always prayed to have a pure man. I am literally suffocating. Should I mention that whole thing to him? Tell my parents? or move on?\nTL;DR:"}

Drew and I dated for 2 years. We broke up mutually to grow as individuals. During a 3 month span (May-Sept) we did not see each other but we still stayed in contact. During this time I started seeing another guy, and Drew heavily used tinder. We would talk about his matches, and how everything was going. We naturally became best friends without it feeling forced, or weird. It's strange but it happens, and I'm glad it did. Anyway, eventually he ended up having sex with this one girl in his friend group. It was a one time thing. Surprisingly I wasn't jealous and was genuinely happy for him. He was getting what he wanted.\n\nFast forward to this past Thursday and Friday night. Thursday we went to the local college bar with a few friends and at one point we were all on the dance floor. He was trying to dance with girls and they all were constantly rejecting him. I even tried helping out the best I could. He was bummed out since our other guy friends were successfully dancing with girls. Friday night we went to the same bar and the same thing happened again. He was very bummed after this as well.\n\nSo I guess I just need advice on how he can successfully pick up girls at bars. He's not a bad looking guy, not stereotypically attractive but he is attractive (I've talked to a few friends about his appearance so that I didn't have a bias opinion).

We went to a restaurant that serves different types of chicken. I ordered a Jamaican jerk chicken served with sweet potato puree and chilli. I tried a little bit of both. Awesome chicken BTW at least the little that I tried. Then i noticed that there were a little bit of pepper (not sure of what kind) with a little bit of salad on the side. I thought: \" Well wikipedia said that the seeds were the problem, theres no seeds on it. Let's try.\"\n\nI tried it. Chewed it and swallowed. \nMy mouth started burning as hell, i drank white wine, my girlfriend's water. Nothing could stop that. I thought I was going to die. Strange people were all arrounf me, I couldn't act silly. I tried to stay normal. My girlfriend said I failed that also. Apparently I was all red and sweating, tears down my eyes. BTW I lost the ability to taste for several minutes. I ate the chicken without being able to taste it, but judging by the first attempt, before the pepper, I think It was amazing.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps\nTITLE: Ex broke the no contact rule to send me some pictures. Not sure why I care.\nPOST: I [26f] broke up with my boyfriend [23m] almost exactly a month ago. We talked a little the first week and a half or so and haven't talked at all since. No texting, blocked on facebook, no calls, and we hang out at different places.\n\nThis guy was very, very mean last time we talked. He made fun of me for being sad, called me names, and completely squashed any desire I had to want him in my life. I've been doing really well, I have sad moments, but very few and they don't last longer than a few minutes. \n\nToday my calendar fell and when I went to pick it up, the first thing I saw was what would have been our 6 month anniversary, felt a twinge and moved on. Later my roommate started watching a show that he and I used to watch together. Little sad feeling for about a minute. Realized tomorrow will be four weeks since the break up, feel a little odd and moved on. \n\nThen he texted me. He sent me two pictures from my graduation and told me I deserved to have them. I thanked him and sent him some of him (playing guitar, hanging out with friends, etc.) He was mostly nice, just mentioned one little thing and said we didn't need to argue about it. I had no intention of arguing, I thanked him for the pictures and said I hope he is doing well. He said \"yep\" and that was the end of the conversation. \n\nI just wonder why he would do this now. He was very hateful and mean during the break up. He was doing his best to hurt me, make me feel bad about myself, and make me feel guilty. I appreciate having the pictures, but confused about how he could be such a dick and then do something nice out of the blue. \n\nI have no plans to contact him again, even though I am curious and think it's odd that after a few things that made me think about him, he texted that same day. \n\nI do not want this guy back, but I was doing really well and no I have confusing feelings that I can't explain or get rid of.\nTL;DR:"}

But just recently he was asked to moderate a sub that he spends a lot of time on, so now he has more of an obligation to this website. So it just seems like it can take a toll on our quality time we share when we're together. He's on reddit on his phone so much, and I feel very ignored. I try to mildly interrupt what he's doing to try to show him that I don't appreciate it, but it doesn't really work. \n\nAm I overreacting? How can I try to help this situation so that I don't feel so ignored and unappreciated for my time?\nTL;DR:"}

I came into it with the wrong mentality.\n\nA few years after we've started dating, we are still together and we've had more ups than downs. We laugh so much together, treat each other well and respectfully, and are there for one another when things get rough. He helps me when I'm feeling low and vice versa.

After a bit of her yelling at me about the seriousness of the situation she's in and really letting the bank itself have it, she asks for my name, my manager's name, and her contact. I give her all that and the worst part is we unfortunately have to report these complaints ourselves and escalate based on things said and how upset the customer was, especially if it could not be resolved at the point of contact. If they find out we haven't documented it but knew about the complaint, it's doubly worse.\n\nSo here I am, on what I assume will be my last time on reddit at work for a while, awaiting the doom to come down most likely Monday from our escalations department and my branch manager.\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [19M] with my girlfriend [19 F] for 1.5 years, I feel unfulfilled, help?\nPOST: So my girlfriend and I have been together for almost two years and next year I start Uni (she's already been for a year), I love her more than anything, she's my soulmate. \n\nLately I've noticed myself craving more sexual encounters, to test the waters so to speak, and its made me realize I may cheat on my GF at Uni. Ive only had sex with two women in my life (her included) and she's had sex with maybe 7-10 guys before me (which makes me feel as though she is satisfied, whereas I am not). I feel as though if I don't explore more now then in 30 years when we are married with children, I may cheat, which in my opinion would be WAY worse. \n\nWhat I'm asking is, from a Woman's perspective, is this a valid reason? I know it makes me seem extremely douchy but I'm truly just trying to find a way to ensure we have long happy lives together. If not what would you want someone in my position/what would you want, to do? Breaking up or ending things is not something I want to do.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/GetMotivated\nTITLE: Don't go to the gym!\nPOST: Hi,\n\nI always had a problem with motivation for doing sports and that's probably why I got fat. Although I went running for a while I usually stopped doing it for a long time if I didn't get the chance of doing it for a week, for example getting a cold, which just happens at least twice a year for me, or I got a rash between the legs (you know there's some friction there when you're fat). I also went to the gym for a while but the expensive membership (30 Euros/month at my closest gym) and the distance I had to drive to get there (about 30 minutes, which already adds up to an hour lost) kept me from going after a while.\nIn other words it wasn't even the sports themselves keeping me from doing it but all the overhead you have to do and things that got in between.\n\nI'm proud that since this spring I've managed to go jogging every other day for half a year now. Even though i had a break because I took a trip to the US for 3 weeks I picked it up right away after coming back. I got a rash between the legs and I discovered that just applying a lot of Nivea body lotion before jogging eliminates the problem completely. Later I got some knee problems in the right knee, I paused for two weeks and then discovered that running with a midfoot strike is much better for my knee. In other words I overcame these problems this time, instead of giving up.\n\nFurther I though about signing up for the gym, but as I didn't have enough money I just ordered some dumbbells, because this year I finally thought to myself that any small workout is better than a big workout at a gym which I'm not following through with. So I ordered a 40 Euro dumbbell set and I'm doing some biceps curls and some triceps training and a bit of shoulder. It's not much, but it is something.\n\nI haven't lost weight this year, but I have definitely lost fat and gained muscle, which anybody who has seen me without clothes has noticed.\nTL;DR:"}

She's everything I'd ever want in a partner - smart, witty, funny, tall, thin, good looking - and we essentially share the same brain. I mean, it's eerie the way we're wired so similarly. \n\nHere's the rub - the universe has handed me a real shit sandwich here because depsite thinking she's objectively good looking and despite all of these similarities and compatibilities, she fails to ignite the fire in my loins. It's not a complete flatline. We've been having sex and once we're into it I'm generally able to enjoy it - it's certainly better than a sharp stick in the eye - but I don't feel the DESIRE for her. I don't think about her all day. I don't get the butterflies or the fireworks or the weak knees. There's no animal magnetism. She feels like a buddy. \n\nLike any good dork would do, I've been doing my internet research on whether the fire can ignite down the road and of course it's all over the place and largely idiosyncratic. Some say yes, some say no - and I won't know until I get there. I'm comfortable knowing there's no right answer here and I'm willing to keep seeing it through because as I've said, she's amazing. \n\nBut what weighs on me is whether I say anything to her, and if so, how the hell you bring this up in a way that isn't completely insulting, and allows us to continue to explore the relationship without hanging this dark cloud over it? I *want* to want her, if I could press some button or flip some switch I would in a heartbeat. The lust is just ... not ... really ... there.\n\nSo do I say anything? Just keep riding it out?

He left to stay with family for about 2 weeks and came back because well he still technically lives here. Now he is saying he's a changed man, he has been cooking food for me and showering me with presents. I keep saying it won't change my mind. I keep telling him he has to look for a new apartment and it seems like he's dragging his heels. He hasn't contacted any rental place at all.

As the title says, my girlfriend left me last November, after two years of dating. It happened suddenly and out of the blue. And I still can't wrap my head around it.\n\nWe've had a fairly happy relationship for the two years that were dating. Sure, we had arguments here and there, but overall it was good. I was happy and she seemed rather happy. In fact, her dad and I were talking about us marrying sometime down the road. I even got to celebrate her sister's wedding with her, we caught the garter and the flowers that night.\n\nAlas, two weeks after her sister's wedding she went on a camping trip with some of her college friends. When she came back, she became somewhat distant and hard to reach. Her mom and her were fighting again and she was going through finals, so I attributed it to that. But then, two weeks after she told me that was leaving me. \n\nShe told me that it wasn't my fault and that I'd done nothing wrong. She told me that she has become complacent with me. That she had priorities that she needed to focus on like working out and losing weight, getting a job and finishing college. Finding out what she wanted to do with her life. And that she needed space for all of that.\n\nAnd so she left.That was it. The short few times we came in contact to get some of my stuff back was like pulling teeth. She essentially hid from me or would bail on me. It all ended up with my stuff getting to me through someone else.\n\nWhat did I do wrong? Why does it still upset me? And why is it so hard for me to go out on dates with other women(my friends thought that meeting other women would cheer me up, but alas it did not).\nTL;DR:"}

The work is hard, but I'm very good at it, and I enjoy that it gives me some exercise and I can stay busy. I have worked there for 3 months roughly now, and most of my coworkers are fine, but I've had some issues.\n\nA few days ago a manager told me to go to the freezer and bag air and bring it out to the front (something about fumes and scents getting out or whatever).  I thought this was really strange and kept asking her why, and suggesting that I go back to doing my real job, but her and another manager insisted.  So I did that and it didn't take long for me to realize that they were playing a joke on me.  Everyone was laughing and it definitely sent me back to being bullied in the past.\n\nOne of the managers, the female one, didn't really apologize, but told me that what happened wasn't that bad and that it happens to everyone.  That made me feel worse, because now I feel like i'm in an environment where it's OK for people to mock me. She also said I could prank people back, but I don't really have any interest in making anyone else feel shitty.\n\nIn addition to this specific instance, more things have happened that have made the work environment not very professional.  Inappropriate sexual comments are common.  Often I am made to stay late because a manager will \"forget\" to ask me to leave.  People have taken to calling me Jimmy Neutron because I do well in school and fit the stereotype of your classic nerd, which I hate, but most of the people there are older than me, and bus boy are at the bottom of the pecking order, so I don't feel like I can call them out on it.\n\nI may be overreacting.

I used to be a very trusting person - I trusted my wife 100% and was in complete shock and denial initially when I found out. After the shock wore off I started divorce proceedings. I thought after a few months I was getting over it ok and moving on but slowly started to notice changes in how I viewed other people. Internally I questioned everyone's motivations, even close friends and I stopped sharing my feelings with people. I've avoided romantic relationships completely and limited myself to occasional casual hookups.\n\nThen I met Angela. She's smart, has a wicked sense of humor, strong... but its more than that, even on the first date. It was the look in her eyes, the way she touched my hand. I could feel my defenses beginning to crumble. The second time we met up she blew them away completely. We've spent so much time together and are so compatible it feels like we've been a couple for months. We've been dating for four weeks. I've told her how much I like her and she feels the same way. So far so good.\n\nNow I'm thinking of where this could go and I'm afraid - if I love someone again, if I trust someone again then I could get hurt badly again. I know I'm not going to throw this away just for that reason - but thinking ahead if she is going out with friends for a night out or is staying at someone's house my imagination is going to be creating terrible possibilities. I was never a jealous or untrusting person before but now... I need to figure this out and address it because she shouldn't have to deal with my baggage. Do you have any advice on how to get over these kind of trust issues? For context she's aware of my divorce and what happened. I haven't talked to a therapist about the breakdown of my marriage despite friends urging me to (I don't know why I chose not to).\nTL;DR:"}

Jane suggested that she move in also, \"as a roommate.\" This way, we won't have to swap the child back & forth all the time. Jane said she would not be bothered by my relationships with other girls. I'm not sure if she still has feelings for me, but I know I am over her.\n\nI really want this to work out because I do not look forward to swapping my child back & forth for the next decade & a half. I would love nothing more than having my child 24/7. \n\nThe downsides are obvious. There are not many girls out there that would interested in starting a relationship with someone who lives with his ex-girlfriend & child.

We thought that would handle it all beautifully, but then we made the mistake of mentioning it to our families. \n\nBoth our mothers freaked out.

Tossing and turning, getting up to get a cup of water every hour, stuff like that. She's been starting to look like a zombie, with huge dark circles under her eyes and moving slowly.

I was happy, thinking that her lack of sleep has caught up with her and I hoped she would finally get a good nights sleep. I offered to come to bed with her, but she wanted me to finish the movie and told me to come to bed when I was finished. \n\nAfter the movie I made some food, and as I was finishing eating I heard screaming. I ran into the bedroom and Liv was screaming and shaking and crying. It was honesty the most upsetting thing I've seen. After I managed to calm her down, she just said she had a bad dream and didn't want to talk about it, and she just wanted to lay with me. Neither of us slept, she just laid there and cried as I tried to comfort her. I asked her multiple times if she wanted to tell me anything, but she just said it was nothing. \n\nShe's working late tonight, so she still isn't home.

I leave the store happy, hook up the coupler with the new o-rings, and kick the water on.\n\nEverything seemed to be fine at first.

I started seeing my coworker a few weeks ago. We both admitted to having getting out of messy relationships. We ended up hanging out more often, and never really had a \"label\" - I was happy with the way things were going. \n\nHe did mention that he had trouble opening up to people so I let him be - if he wanted to tell me something he would do it and I wouldn't pressure him. \n\nWell, lately he had a lot happening in his life (death, working a lot, second job) but I found out he was going through a divorce, too. He said he got married at 18, he's not with her. \n\nI tried limiting the amount of times ill text him, and would barely hear from him. \n\nFinally, yesterday I asked him to tell me if he still wanted me in his life or if he's too busy, I just wanted to know. He said it depends what I want us to be (move in together?) and that he's messed up with relationships now. I said no (im not crazy), I just want to know if I should back off until he's figured everything out. \n\nFinally he said \"as for right now I don't think there's much I can offer you babe :(\" and I was relieved, in a way. I thanked him for being honest, wished him luck and said maybe sometime in the future? He said of course. \n\nAnyway, question is, do you think I fucked up by being too needy?

Her reason behind this was because she wanted \"independence\" and that she would have \"more time to date later on in life\". She told me that she would \"always love me\", and that she would \"always be my friend\". This hit me like a train, everything seemed fine the days before and we haven't fought over anything major in a while either. I know that most relationships that teenagers have these days don't last long but I really felt that we were going to last. I was so shocked I didn't know what to say or do, I've been going through some pretty tough things the past few months and this was just adding on to the ever growing list of hardships.\n\n  So, I asked her to stay with me and that if she just wanted some independence we could take a break until she was ready again. She denied my request and told me that she had no intention in coming back to me. She also told me that it wasn't anything that I did and that \"it was her\".\n\n  I've been trying to get over her the past few hours, but all I've accomplished is just crying until my eyes got swollen and losing my voice from screaming in frustration. My parents came home and I told them about my break-up and they tried cheering me up by taking me out to eat. But I can't stop thinking about it.

We've been together for over three years and he makes me the happiest I have ever been.  He treats me well and we are very compatible with each other.  We argue somewhat frequently but they are mostly just petty arguments. I love him and wouldn't risk our relationship for anything.  He's just an overall sweet guy.\n\nThe only thing is I have really strong PURELY physical feelings for one of my best guy friends.  It's like every time we hang out there is just so much physical chemistry, other friends have pointed it out.  We've never acted on it, but it's getting harder every single time we hang out.  I would never risk my relationship over these feelings, especially since they are only physical.  We would never be in a relationship with each other so really the only thing that would happen between us would be sex.  I don't want to cheat on my boyfriend and I don't think I could but each time we hang out things just go even farther.  It's like my brain goes out the window and my body does the thinking.  \n\nTo be clear, when we hang out, it isn't just us.  It's my other guy best friend that I grew up with as well.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice\nTITLE: I [26/m] am having trouble with knowing too much about my girlfriend [21/f].\nPOST: To begin, I love my girlfriend with all of my heart. Everything has been amazing, and even when things aren't, we work through them together. We physically, emotionally, and mentally stimulate each other in ways that neither of us have ever felt before. To say that we're serious is an understatement. However, there is one issue we're both trying to deal with, but I seem to be having a bit more trouble than she is.\n\nThe Problem: Before we started dating, we hung out quite a bit. We had the type of friendship where we could sit for hours on end just talking and never get bored. During this time, we both talked about our past relationships a lot, including the sex. It wasn't uncommon for us to go into get detail as we tried to one up each others sexual exploits. After we started dating and becoming more serious, this came back to bite us in the ass. She has her moments, but she seems to be coping well enough. I, however, have a terribly vivid imagination.\n\nAdditional Details: We've talked about this problem together, and we both always come out of the conversation feeling better. I tend to let it get to me more often than she does, so I end up bringing it up more frequently. I'm trying my best to deal with this because it's not fair to her that I keep digging up the past. I want to fix this, for both of our sake.\n\nA Bit More About Me Specifically: I don't care that she's been with other guys. I love her and accept her for who she is, and I wouldn't change a thing. My problem is that I know details that I wish I didn't. Every so often, a terrible mental image of her and one of her exs invades my mind, and I can't get rid of it. It doesn't help that she's an amazing woman and most of her exs were scumbags.\n\nThe Question: Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with detailed mental images of my girlfriend with other guys? The best I've come up with is that my imagination is probably worse than the real thing, but it doesn't seem to help.\nTL;DR:"}

Recently, he broke up with her, and we've had more time to hang out with each other as part of a huge friend group.\n\nIn the past few weeks, I somehow ended up hanging out with him alone a few times, though I had only the intention of hanging out with him as a friend. Our hang outs ended up being really date-like, for example he insisted on paying for my dinner (even though we always split the bills when we go out together with friends) and walked me home out of his way. I decided to just go with it because I thought I was still interested in him, but it turns out I'm not at all!\n\nNow, he's been trying to ask me to hang out with him just us more and more without directly coming out and asking me out on a date. Another mutual friends of ours who's really close to this guy has also not so subtly been dropping hints about us getting together. I should also mention that our larger group of friends is really friendly with each other, and we hug and cuddle each other all the time. So I had been acting like that around him as usual. We also see each other almost every day.\n\nSo I don't know what to do! I've been telling him I'm can't make it when he asks to hang out alone and I've (obviously) stopped with any friendly-touching.

I don't understand what would change in the next year or so to make him more sure. I'm tired of friends, family, and co-workers constantly asking me when we're getting married, because the only answer I have is that it isn't up to me. I don't think he gets that outside pressure the same way that I do (I've never heard any of his friends or family mention us getting married).  I hate that we aren't family despite the fact that I love him more than I've ever loved anyone.

I decided to break out some food and eat while I waited.\n\nThen I noticed a chipmunk about ten feet away, just staring at me and my food. It kind of took me by surprise, because chipmunks are typically so scared of people. Then it occurred to me that it must be hungry, so I tossed a bit of bread from my sandwich near it. It ran over and picked it up and ate it. I did this a few more times, and two more chipmunks appeared to join in.\n\nSlowly, I brought them closer to me with each bit of food. Then, when they were less than a foot away, I just put some peanuts into the palm of my hand and extended it. One of the chipmunks strolled right up, crawled onto my hand and ate the nuts. I was actually laughing out out at this point because I had never experienced anything like that before. \n\nAt that point, the rest of my hiking party approached and scared off the chipmunks.

By the time I arrived to class, I began to experience a caffeine crash. To make matters worse, I found out we were having a group discussion today in preparation for an exam. So, I pulled up a chair to my designated group and participated as much as I could, but in all honesty, I could not pay attention at all. At about a quarter into the session, the girl next to me asked me a question, I was able to answer it. Then, she asked me another; however, this time around whatever she said was incoherent to me. I replied with, \"I don't know.\" When I looked at her face, she was started to laugh and I didn't know why. Replaying this incident several times in my head, I realized she was asking me what my name was. In conjunction to my apparent disability (hearing aids are the BTE model, so it is pretty obvious), this incident probably made her think I'm socially impaired and probably have Asperger's.\nTL;DR:"}

My girlfriend recently told me that she does not feel in love with me and said her feelings haven't grown since we met each other. Her reasoning was that was that we haven't been able to spend enough time with each other. \n\nI admit that our situation isn't ideal...we only see each other about 2x a week on a regular basis and sometimes go through periods where I can't see her for 2 weeks at a time, usually during finals week. I am currently finishing my 5 year degree of an extremely intensive university course and I honestly can't make much more time than that. I am with her whenever I have spare time. I make it clear that once I am finished at the end of the year I will have more time for her. We make an effort to speak to each other every day at the very least. I think once I finish and have more time for her, she will reassess her feelings for me, at least thats the gist I got from her when we spoke.\n\nHearing this hit me really hard because I know that I feel very strongly for her. This is my first ever serious relationship and I was preparing to say the L word very soon. She has met my parents and I have met hers. But now I am having second thoughts... I am glad she was honest with me but the truth hurts. I dont want to be with someone who doesnt feel the same way I do and I feel like 6 months is roughly enough time to sort these feelings out. I am considering cutting my losses and moving on.\n\nHowever, I do see her side of the story and dont want to risk losing a good thing or something that could develop into something more... should I give her more time? Am I just being crazy and insecure?\nTL;DR:"}

She uses a walker to get around.\n\n About 20 years ago, her father died and left behind the house to all of his children who agreed to let her stay in the house for however long she needed. As far as know, there was never a contract stating that, but there was some sort of legal document placing all of the children's names on it (i.e. aunts, uncles, and my mom's). This means that my Aunt Y has been living in this house for the last 20 years.\n\nUncle X has an adult child who has bipolar disorder and is currently on a manic phase. Adult child has tried to move in with Aunt Y. Aunt Y agreed to let her stay for one week, in which the adult child did several subtle things to try to hurt Aunt Y without touching her...i.e. creating obstacles intentionally in the house that Aunt Y couldn't get through easily because the use of the walker, locked her out of her own house, etc.\n\nAfter about a week, adult child ended up back in the hospital and did not come back to the house for a while. Now today, adult child plus some random boyfriend showed up to Aunt Y's house demanding to be let in and demanding that they will live there. Aunt Y called the police. Uncle Z (brother to Uncle X and Aunt Y) showed up then and told Aunt Y that he was kicking her out of the house today. Again, Aunt Y has lived there for over 20 years. \n\nMy mom has been trying to help from afar, but she can obviously only do so much.

However, she recently told me of one event, about four years ago, when someone she knew as an acquaintance (same age as she is) pulled a knife on her and raped her. It hurts me to think about, and brings forth an array of emotions that I don't really know how to deal with. However, I really care about her and want to to whatever I can to help her, but I also want to make sure I'm not leading myself into an emotional trap by going into this relationship. She says she doesn't really remember the whole thing all that well, and that she tries to think about it as little as possible. Since she is still a minor, we're waiting on intimacy until her birthday, so that isn't what I'm concerned about. I've come to Reddit seeking answers for my questions, and to help me get a better idea of how to be a supportive boyfriend. Can we have a normal relationship? How can I let her know I am there for her? Will she be sexually and emotionally closed off, or, with time, will she learn to trust that I'm not going to hurt her? I just don't know what to think of the whole thing, and I'm hoping that Reddit can help me.\nTL;DR:"}

Two weeks ago, I got an abortion. Looking back, it wasn't a decision I would have ever made on my own...I was weak and believed him when he told me I would make a terrible mother and that I could never raise a baby on my own. We broke up last night after he told me he wished he never met me and that I'm the reason why his life was so miserable the last few months. He said he was tired of me being so dramatic about the abortion and that I should get over it already.\n\nThat was what it took for me to finally block him off. He sent me an email today and he was talking about how it was immature of me to block him. He said something on the lines of how my parents would be so disappointed to learn their daughter had an abortion. (He knows my parents are very pro life and religious about it)\n\nIt sounded like a threat to tell them about me. I love my parents and my mother recently lost her sister so I can't bear the thought of him dumping news like this on her. I'm so scared he will tell them about this thing that I'm still in pain over...I want to bury it and not disappoint my parents about it too.

I do have some feelings for her, but I'm still a little stuck on my ex. Her and I hung out a few times after she approached me, and yesterday it culminated in pretty heavy make out session.

It has been a long time since I've seen her this happy with anyone.

She openly says \"I love you\" but I can't say it back because it would mean lying to her face. We've agreed to stay together on the hopes that I may one day feel the same way for her. \n\nShe has a very dark and miserable history with her family and being bullied at school. She fell in love with me because I was there for her when no one else was. When I tried to break up she sobbingly told me not to leave her alone (with her family and demons and such) and that doing so would \"destroy\" her. \n\nI couldn't bring myself to do it. Partly because I REALLY do still care for her immensely, but also because I couldn't stand to hurt her while she was so fragile. \n\nI guess my question is, is there hope for this relationship even though I don't love her yet? And am I selfish for not letting her go because I'm afraid to be the person who \"destroyed\" her and because I'm afraid of losing her and what we had forever?\n\nThank you all in advance.\nTL;DR:"}

When driving her home last night, she mentioned she ran into a former friend of hers that she said she was extremely close to. According to her, he confessed that he was interested in her and she said that made her lose interest in their friendship all together and she completely ignored him afterward. I really don't want that to happen, but these feelings are really annoying me now. \n\nShe also makes it a point to say I'm her 'favorite' and that I'm so sweet, and how I view/judge her means a lot to her and that just hurts even more because I don't know why she makes it a point to say that, it just evokes feelings that really aren't pleasant. \n\nWhat really affects me is that jealousy/loneliness/longing feeling to be with her.

We both go to different colleges, so the only time I've had a chance to hang out with him is during school breaks.\n\nSince the very beginning from when we first met, we've always been a little flirty with each other. Initially it didn't seem like it would go anywhere, especially since I'm really good at denying my own feelings and misreading other people's signals. \nBut over the last several weeks of winter break, I feel like things between Alex and me have escalated to the point where our chemistry is undeniable.

He's not the type to talk about his feelings or the type to take the initiative either, and I'm pretty tired of waiting around wondering \"Does he like me or does he not\" and \"Why won't he make a move already.\" The issue is... he just left last week to study abroad. I won't see him again for 5, maybe more, months, and I don't know if it's worth it to say anything to him now, if he's across the world.  And if I were to say something, I don't know what to say and how to do it. Over e-mail? Skype? One other thing is, if this doesn't go over well, it has a high probability of screwing over our friendship and our mutual friend group (whole lotta awkwardness).

I've flaired this as 'non-romantic' for that reason.\n\nOutside of that, it was her birthday recently and I created a personalised card for her, and texted her to wish her a happy birthday that morning - this would understandably weird out someone when we don't talk very often; but we actually know quite a bit about each-other and she actually liked and thoroughly enjoyed this. I never constantly try to contact or interact her online or text her for no reason (we're lucky to talk online or text once a week or less, and even then it's only to confirm something that we've organised previously), never spent money on her, etc. The friendship is platonic even with my mild interest in her beyond that.\nTL;DR:"}

We took turns driving and when it was Jasmine's turn I took a nap in the backseat. Jasmine woke me up to inform me that the car was breaking down. I saw that the engine was overheating and smoking from the vents. When we took the next exit it completely stopped and we had to push it to the side of the road. A police officer stopped to help us out and he said the coolant levels were fine. Then we had it towed to a repair shop. \n\nThe mechanic said that the engine was really overheated, the radiator was leaking, and the ignition coils had melted in spark plug tubes. From what I gathered, Jasmine didn't understand what the temperature gauge on the dashboard meant and kept driving even as the engine temperature kept rising. The estimate they gave me for the repair was $3700. Even though Jasmine was driving, she did not offer to help pay for the repairs at all. In the end I had to take out a loan to cover the cost of the repairs. \n\nWe are all college students working part time so $3700 is a lot of money for us. I had previously just had to spent most of my savings on tuition and buying a used car (this one). \n\nI'm wondering if I should ask her to help me pay for it. Even though it was my car, she was the driver and it was because of her lack of driving knowledge that caused the engine damage, so I feel like she should at least help pay. I haven't asked her because I don't want to ruin our friendship which I cherish greatly, but at the same time, it's a lot of money and it's going to be stressful for me in the long run.

His condition has progressed over the years and his behavior is somewhat unpredictable. He has the tendency to yell and cause scenes in public when things do not go his way. A quick example: he got us kicked out of a really nice steakhouse on his mother's birthday because my cousin couldn't make it to the dinner and he had no one to talk to about video games. (This cousin is pretty good at keeping him calm but will not be attending the wedding). Since my family has been very close to his since we were born, he was obviously invited to the wedding. \n\nInitially, the invite was sent to all 4 of his family members, but his mother RSVPd that only her and her daughter would be attending the reception. My family let out a little sigh of relief that we wouldn't have to worry about him causing a scene. The wedding is now in less than a month, and his mother called my mother yesterday, saying that now he would like to attend the reception. My mother calmly explained that his spot was already filled with someone else, since he declined the invitation weeks ago. His mother then suggested that he could have her spot. From his mother's POV, she is trying to appease him by letting him attend.

[Portland, OR]\nPOST: I got the keys to an apartment on Monday February 1st. The place was still a bit dirty, and the property manager said they need to finish the job that night/the next morning. It was fine because we weren't moving in until Friday. \n\nQuick backstory: We had asked for some changes to the lease; none of the requests were honored. We also asked if we could move in on Friday the 29th since we work 9-5/M-F jobs. They said only if we pay prorated rent ($150). The previous tenant is actually the owner, who had to quickly move for a job offer. I sense he trusted they would clean the place before the next tenant.\n\nFriday the 5th comes around and the place is still filthy ([proof in pictures] They weren't open until Monday, and we called at 9:01am. They were reluctant at first, saying they thought it was \"pretty clean,\" but I reminded them that their opinion is different than the standards outlined in the lease. They agreed to clean it the next morning (yesterday, Tuesday February 9). They never came, and when I called they said it was \"a crazy day.\"\n\nI offered to have us clean it for $20 an hour or hire a third party since they are swamped with other work. I haven't heard back yet. BUT, that's not enough for us. We can't move in our belongings because it needs to be cleaned first. (We can't put a couch against a wall that needs to be wiped, and dishes into dirty cabinets.) \n\nI want to ask for not only the place to be cleaned, but I feel it's fair to be reimbursed for the days it wasn't ready. If they had offered us flexibility to move in on the 29th and the place was still dirty, that is one thing. But to have a place still not move-in ready 10-12 days AFTER the start of the lease, it's not acceptable. We pay $2,195 a month, so it's not chump change.\nTL;DR:"}

I have a good guy friend who is seventeen (and white, if that makes a difference). In the past few weeks, we have been pretty close. I've known him as an acquaintance for about four months, and then we became good friends after he asked me for my phone number. (Technically, I've known him for about seven months). There is a large potential for us to date (he started a conversation about us getting married some day, what our halfie kids will look like, colleges, etc.), but a friend of mine told me that he confessed to her that he really liked me, but he's afraid that my parents will make things awkward should we date. \n\nMy parents are afraid that I will go \"crazy,\" and think about nothing but my (hopefully future) boyfriend (thus making my grades drop...). I haven't spoken them about wanting a boyfriend yet, and I'm thinking about how I should approach them. I feel that I am mature enough for a relationship with another human. \n\nSome things I will do when speaking to them:\n\n- Speak in a calm manner\n- Attempt to catch my parents in a good mood\n- Possibly compromise grades (if my grades drop below a certain GPA, I'll break up with him)\n- Mention that he has good grades, he's not trashy, etc.\n- Mention that they (my parents) raised me well, and I will not do \"bad\" things\n- Mention that he is a Christian (I know this has nothing to do with it, but my parents are huge Christians) \n\nBottom line, I'm looking for further advice on anything else I should do.

More importantly, other coworkers have been having more trouble with her than me but we are all good friends and nobody wants to be singled out as the one who made the complaint.\n\nWe have tried to get her to be more active but she usually finds ways to look busy and pretend to comply. We have let it go on for a couple of months and it seems to be getting worse and she has been going in huffs with people who complain to her. So we didn't just go straight to our boss. And even making a complaint, our boss is quite understanding and would make an effort if we had problems.\n\nSo yesterday we decided something had to be said and we made a decision as a group to let our boss know. I convinced people to leave out the things that would actually get her in trouble and to just make it seem like she wasn't pulling her weight.\n\nToday I have just got texts saying things like \"I thought we were friends\" and \"I am under a lot of pressure and nobody thought to ask\". Now nobody thought there was anything wrong with her, she is always upbeat and it was even a little hard to take how upbeat she was as if there was nothing wrong with her laziness. As I said our boss is understanding and if she went to her saying that then there would not be a problem but we would still need someone to work the same amount as the rest of us on busy days.\n\nI understand being at work and being stressed out to hell as I have been on the verge of breaking down there but I don't understand making everyone else the bad guys when everyone is willing to listen and understand. I don't know how to go about this as she is important to all of us there. Even if she turns out to be just taking advantage of us we still have to work with her for the foreseeable future.\nTL;DR:"}

This week we were planning to go to her place after school, make some tacos and just chill (we live one hour apart and she has to watch her dog when her mom is working, so it's not always suitable to be at my place). Unfortunately, I got a brutal cold on tuesday (which I still have), so I was never able to. No biggie, she'll come over here on saturday, as she usually does on weekends anyway.\n\nSo I have been on the couch with a fever, bored as hell, for the past three days, and this is the one thing I have been looking forward to.

Then I'll just have to do something with somebody else, cause really, I dont wanna sit on my ass for one more night.\"\n\nI ask what she had in mind, she then says that she wasn't thinking of anything very exhausting as I wasn't in shape, then that she didn't have any specific ideas and that \"we'll just see tomorrow\". Wtf?\n\nSo, normally I would let this slide I guess, but the thing is I just recently forgave her for being kind of an ass to me while drunk last weekend (our first \"fight\" ever), so this really annoyed me. Then again, I do love her very much, and I really, really don't like being mad at her (she may sound like a total bitch from this post, but she's really not).

We have watched tv in his bed, and we were under the same blanket but he didn't initiate and I didn't initiate because I'm scared.\n\nBut he IS really really busy. He works daily because right now his lab is understaffed. Sometimes he doesn't get home until 9 pm. \n\nI really really really like this dude. I haven't liked a guy like this way in quite awhile.

I've set strict boundaries so my boyfriend won't be uncomfortable and I can still maintain a friendship with him. However, for Christmas, my friend/coworker bought me plane tickets and court side seats to a basketball game in my hometown for us to go together. This has caused a bit of tension between my boyfriend and I as he is uncomfortable with such a lavish gift. I'm not really sure how to go about this situation without ruining a good friendship, a work relationship, or seeming ungrateful. However it seems a bit intimate and lavish of a gift for me to accept.\nTL;DR:"}

Ive started dating this wonderful, amazing, funny, beautiful girl. Lets call her Jess. I'm amazingly comfortable with her, something I've never fully been able to do with many girls. Having a great time together, but some things have started to worry me.  \n\nFor one, she's kept every love letter and email  ex boyfriends have sent her. She's on occasion read them to me, and I've tried to be cool and play it off, but I'm kind of uncomfortable with it. Secondly, she is in constant contact with her most recent Ex. She makes it a point to always make it clear that they're friends and nothing serious is there, but recently he's been saying that the chances of me making her happy are slim and that he loves her. Apparently some of what he says gets to her, and she says she has doubts and isn't sure. And lastly, She's definitely bi curious, but has said that if given the chance, she would definitely sleep with a girl if she could get away with it. And that's what is really bothering me. Jess and I have been together for a while, and I feel pretty committed to her, but her saying that kind of felt like she was admitting that she would cheat of me if the chance arose. Am I freaking out about this unnecessarily? Am I looking to much into this? I want this to work, but my doubts have really started to bother me. I'm confused and afraid and don't know what to do.

Even a few \"Please don't call me again, thank you.\" I can handle those. I like those people.\n\nThen there was a lot of hostility and vitriol present in the other half. From swear-lined comments about my line of work to claiming that I sounded foreign (When I was born in the US and have no accent that I am aware of, nor am I foreign) and that I needed to learn English, to people that turned on pornography in the background during calls.\n\nThen there were the ones that threatened to hunt me down and kill me for being an Alien.

Finally, we decide to move on to setting up a date (later this week.) So, having done that, we have been chatting a lot, even moving to texting. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy talking to him, he's stated he's attracted to my body, and I do like his body... etc etc, but where the somewhat strange part is this:\n\nHe seems to want to move fast into the \"seeing each other\" stage. Like, to me, a first date doesn't necessarily mean we're \"dating.\" It just means, we're seeing if it will go anywhere. He's also said he wants a long-term relationship. I don't mind that at all. In fact, I think I'd like one too, but I just worry he's assuming too much about me and maybe thinking I'm this great guy, but then he'll meet me and think I'm pathetic or something.\n\nHe's also asked about making it facebook official. Look, I'm not going to lie, I would love to make it official... when it is. I haven't even met him yet. I don't doubt we will get along well, we share a lot of things in common.

Obviously I broke up with her, but we did remain good friends.\n\nWhen we first started dating, she had told me that she'd been raped by an ex, but I asked her recently about it and she told me that she had lied to me about it, for a reason she doesn't know.\n\nRecently, I started hearing rumours that she had started taking drugs, although just weed mostly and bit of this and that. Her farther is a drug dealer, so she has easy access to any drug she could want. She's only 17, I've looked after her for most of her life and I'm worried that she's going to end up getting into crime or developing an addiction to a hard drug. She says she cares about me, loves me and would do anything for me, so I asked her to stop otherwise I'd move away and break contact with her. She said she would stop and begged me to stay, however I still have the feeling she won't. She has ADHD, so she is impulsive and often acts before she thinks. This, in additon to her previous actions means that it's hard for me to trust her and believe what she says. Currently, I'm not in the same country as her and won't for a few more months, so it's impossible for me to keep a good eye on her.\n\nBasically, do I continue with our friendship, or tell her to screw it?\nTL;DR:"}

Since I'll be three hours away we won't be able to see each other nearly as often as we had been these three months. Both of us want to have some sort of relationship (whether or not it's a friendship or romantic relationship) when I do go, but we're not sure how to handle all of it. A long distance relationship is an option but it might be too hard for us to handle as we would be missing big parts of the college experience if both of us felt tied down by each other. There is also a chance that one of us might cheat on the other or might get jealous since our feelings could change or we find other people. So we want to figure out a situation where we are still in each others' lives but are not tied down by each other during college in the hopes that we could rekindle our relationship later on in the future.\n\nOur current plan is to just be friends during the college semesters. We would still text/skype each other if we have the time, I would visit her during breaks to hang out as friends, and we would be able to date other people. When our first year of college is over and I get back home, we would meet and see how we feel about each other. As long as neither of us are in a relationship by that time and we both are still interested in each other then we could decide whether or not to get back together for the summer. From there we would figure out a new plan based on how the first year went.\n\nOur questions are: what would you suggest for us to do and what do you think of the plan we came up with? It would be great for anyone that has been in this situation to give us some feedback based on your experience.\n\nThank you!\nTL;DR:"}

I've bee searching for ways to at least replace the texture of the headcrabs (especially the poisonous ones *shudder*) with something less intimidating. I found this video and I've franticly searched for the textures for them but haven't found any: \n\nSomething like that would really help me get through the game on my own, despite my somewhat \"pansy\" phobia.\nIf anyone can help me with a way to do this you'll be my hero for life!

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Was in a closed relationship, now it's a one way open relationship; looking for advice on how to approach people I'm interested in.\nPOST: Relationship: M27, F28, 1.5 year duration.\n\nOur relationship was monogamous until recently. She has a non-existent libido and sex is usually uncomfortable or even painful sometimes for her. How often we have sex is often an issue. \n\nOne day out of the blue she told me that it was fine for me to seek sexual relationships with other women. \n\nThe only rules were that it can't be with her close friends. Always wear a condom, and never in our apartment. She doesn't want to hear the details of about it. The final rule being that she can change her mind later if she wants to know details about my sex life. \n\nShe has this idea that I can just walk outside and I have to beat women off of me. That they all want to have sex with me and I've been telling them no. I ask why I think that, and she says it's because I'm very attractive. Which I'm not. I'm not ugly, but I'm not drop dead gorgeous either. I'm certainly not the guy all the girls fight over or approach on their own at a club or a bar.\n\nI told her it probably be at least 6 months minimum before I found someone, maybe even a year. She just refuses to believe it will take that long. Meeting strange women and charming them into bed was never a strength of mine. Everyone I've ever slept with has been connected to me already in someway. A friend, or a friend of a friend. Someones cousin. Something like that.\n\nI don't even know how I'd go about meeting a strange woman let alone charming her panties off.\n\n**How to approach telling them about my situation?**\n\nI don't even know how to bring that up. It feels wrong not to bring it up, like very unethical to not mention my girlfriend, but I don't know what to say. \"Oh, by the way, I'm already dating someone but we have an open relationship and I'm just interested in hanging out, being friends, and potentially hitting that\"?\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/Parenting\nTITLE: Being away for the night\nPOST: Hi r/parenting! \n\nI have a 21 month old girl who I adore. I stay home with her (and go to school online) and have always been her primary caretaker. In total, my husband and I have had about five dates since she was born. She even came with us on our honeymoon last October.\n\nI have been apart from her alone many times (trips to the doctor, grocery store, etc.) as has my husband. However, we have never been away from her for the night. The longest was around 5-6 hours on our anniversary last year. The only time she has been away from her own bed was during a family vacation. It did not go well. She had all of her favorite items, but she relies heavily on the comfort of home.\n\nWell, I just bought midnight showing tickets for The Hobbit (SO EXCITED) on Dec. 14th. My mom is ready and willing (and has been since my daughter was born) to take her for the night. Heck, she'd take her for weeks if I'd let her.\n\nI've committed to this adventure by buying these tickets. I just dropped $48 so that my husband, brother, and I can go stand in line and then see a movie (that I am, again, SO EXCITED about). I cannot back out or chicken out or wuss out. I have committed to being away from my beautiful kid for an entire night.\n\nSo, beyond my own insecurities (I'm going to miss her, I know it) I'm worried about how she'll handle being at my mom's house. She loves being there during the day, LOVES her Grammy, and my mom is amazing with her. She's just never been without me. I cannot even stay and help her get to sleep, because I'll have to be in line for the movie.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm rambling or asking for advice. Have any other parents got any tips for getting over this attachment hump?\nTL;DR:"}

Mostly the way I acted in public,I'm a genuinely curious and strange gal and I can't help but be very 'outgoing' but there have been times where he would become annoyed by it,and my attitude towards anything sexual.I'm very akward when it comes to sex and incredibly intimate situations.It's something that always made me uncomfortable but I'm starting to accept it more thanks to having been in a relationship.My SO didn't seem to understand this completely though.He's more physical ,if you know what I mean,while I'm the more emotional one and am nervous with such intimacy.About a day after my birthday,my SO texts me and tells me we have to 'talk'(We both lived in the same area but due to college I had to move a few states away so it became a LDR).Instead of calling me or using a webcam over the internet he types the dreaded breakup talk.Basically he wants to \"take a break\" because he's stressed due to college and his job,and then when it comes to me and my behavior in the relationship he just can't take it,and he wants his space.So after this all I'm quite upset but we both agree to stay good friends, but I won't contact him for a while since he said he wanted 'space'.Is the way he went through with this break up wrong?Should I be upset?I'd just like to hear an opinion from somebody here in /r/Breakups.Anything is much appreciated <3.\nTL;DR:"}

In terms of relationships, I have never had anything like a date or anything like that. The farthest I got with girls were hugs. But there is a reason to that. None of them appealed to me either in looks or in the intelligance and personality department. Anyway, one of my friends gave me almost like a dare. It wasnt exactly a dare but he said if I could pull it off. He gave me the username of girl I have never met in my life on youtube. He knows her but he said he wont help me out at all i.e meet her in real life or anything like that (said he wants to challenge me). So I watched a couple of her vids and came to the conclusion that she has all that I want: looks, personality, intelligence and is a gamer girl to throw in. Recently (it seems god is on my side) she gave out a tweet that said simply:\"Single\". So give me a reply to her that I can write.\nTL;DR:"}

She is friends with the little girls next door and across the streets, and they all play together.  It varies from under the houses (open carport like area) and in front of the house at the play ground. Her friends are nice little girls, but lately one of their things they like to do is play in and on vehicles. \n\nYesterday, I came downstairs so we could go to the store, and 3 little girls piled out of the cab of our pickup, which is a manual. I asked them not to play in or on our vehicles and then explained to my daughter why I didn't want them to (Even showed her that if they accidentally pull the e-brake the truck rolls backwards).  After we got home, she went to play again, and I look out and they are on the roof of the van across the street, at the girls house. I told my daughter that she needed to come inside, and told her I didn't want her playing on other peoples cars either, because it's dangerous. \n\nToday, she's out playing again, and I go out and spot her on their van again, and hear \"Oh no! Get down! My mom can see us!\". My daughter is now grounded from going out to play with her friends.\n\nMy question is, do I talk to the girls parents? I've never met them. It seems like the girls are pretty much sent out side when they get up and let play outside all day. I don't see their parents check on them (the girls are 5 and 8). I don't know if I'm over stepping my bounds, or if I should just suck it up and let them know their kids are doing something that could get them (or someone else) hurt?\nTL;DR:"}

Please help.\nPOST: So my friend spent the summer on the most boring job imaginable working for Serco. You might not have heard of them but they are a HUGE company working in all sorts of sectors you never thought possible (including helping to privatise the UK justice system). It killed him every day he went, partly because the job was terrible, partly because it took him 3 hours round trip every day, partly because his life's ambition of having a well-paid office job and having money suddenly wasn't so appealing. \nAnyway, the only good thing he took away from this job was a crappy little mug that he cherished as some sort of metaphor for all the lessons he learnt that summer. Today, I broke that metaphor, and I was sorry, but sorry doesn't glue mugs back together.\nHe is a hard man to anger, but this was oddly too much. The only way he can be recompensed is for the mug to be replaced by a mug that is WAY better. As it is his 21st next month I can afford to spend a bit of money on it. It can be purely superficially way better (like, an electric mug?) or more abstractedly an improvement (e.g. the mug was used by Churchill at Yalta).\nPlease post your ideas....HERE *insert downward arrow\nTL;DR:"}

We have two cats, one who is a year and a half that we've had since he was 6 weeks old and a 7 year old female cat we adopted from a shelter back in March. When we brought home the female cat from the shelter we kept her in a separate room for two weeks and tried to slowly introduce them to one another. However the younger cat being exceptionally curious and playful would find ways to sneak into the room when we weren't looking to inspect the new comer.\n\nWe thought the female cat would be okay with the him, she had been in a large play area with 5 other cats from the shelter when we adopted her. It didn't go well with those two. The younger cat constantly batted at her tail wanting to play and she would hiss at him, but never really swat at him (initially).\n\nHowever the female cat began puking EVERY day, she sheds a lot so initially we thought it was just hairballs but once it became daily we took her to the vet who found nothing wrong with her. Both my boyfriend and I think it's from stress having the male cat antagonize her. \n\nAnyway at our old place we got a massive flea infestation (don't know how, both of our cats are strictly indoors) and one cat went to my parents house another went to his parents house. The flea thing cleared up, both of us had to move back in with our parents for a bit before we found a new place.\n\nThe cats have been separated for 4 months now and we'll be bringing them to our new apartment within the week. Any advice as to how to reintroduce them so this might not go so hellishly this time? I couldn't give up either one of them.\nTL;DR:"}

However, they already include subjective info, such as % of vitamins.

On the box, it would use averages and maybe have a small grid or something.  Obviously, you usually only gain weight if you go over a threshold of calories...but I think that would be ok if you run under the assumption that the person has b/c that's a worse case scenario.\n\nIt seems like if you could take an abstract (to most people) concept of a calorie and convert it to something they can understand (weight) they would be less likely to eat that entire tub of ice cream.\nTL;DR:"}

I'm ashamed to say that I find her increasing less attractive and my sex drive has gone way down. Also she doesn't like going out with me and my friends because she is intimidated by them (she gets so nervous that she starts calling them ma'am and sir). There are some other small things that annoy me about her, but that's normal for a relationship. \n\nAll this to say I've been thinking about breaking it off. It makes me sad and sick to my stomach to think about but I feel like it's almost over for some reason. You know that feeling you get when something is about to end, like summer or the weekend?

I just feel like it would've been ideal if I had met her a little later in life. I think the biggest reason I'm hesitant to break up with her is I know I'm all she has companion-wise in the area. She moved to the city from her rural hometown, leaving her brother, mother, and all her friends to come to school. I don't want to abandon her I guess.

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskDocs\nTITLE: Severe case of ringworm. Help!\nPOST: I have ringworm that started two months ago as a small rash looking thing on my right shoulder. I asked a doctor he said it's just a fungus and not to worry about it. It spread to my neck, [two spots on each side of my neck] and that's when I went for a second opinion. I was originally just using a no named brand cream and putting bandaids over the area when I had finished the application and it seemed to be fine. I was then diagnosed a combination of cortoderm/lamisil (30/70) and told  I couldn't put bandaids over it cause cortoderm is a steroid and we don't want me skin absorbing too much of it. However now the ringworm was spread extremely quickly over my stomach, back, chest, legs. It's everywhere. It's extremely disheartening. I'm still using the cream perscription. I started putting bandaids over it though today as I feel my clothes are probably spreading it. I need any help I can get on how to make this go away. It's itchy and red and out of control.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My wife is working through some latent mom & dad things, I think\nPOST: My wife (30/f) & I (33/m) have been married for 5 years, we've been together for 10. We have had a good relationship for the most part, and we have two beautiful kids to show for it. The last six months have been fairly difficult though. We've recently moved and went through some financial strain (nothing too out of the ordinary), but I've noticed a dramatic change.\n\nIt wasn't until recently that I realized she's starting to work out some of her issues she had growing up. She didn't have a bad childhood, but her parents weren't very loving. She is an only child and what they lacked in compassion and advice they made up for by buying her things. They didn't ever (and i mean EVER) offer moral support but have always been quick to criticize. For instance, when we went to them to announce that we were expecting our second child, her mom's reaction was to question how we think we're going to be able to take care of TWO children, rather than be excited. FWIW, we never gave anybody any reason to doubt us in our abilities to take care of our first.\n\nLately she's been projecting her father (and herself) onto me, which is excruciating because he & I are so opposite. He was always very controlling and vindictive, with a very strict justice system around the house. He caused her a great deal of anxiety throughout her life and so now I am, just by proxy.\n\nI'm just looking for advice. I have a hard time relating because I had an incredibly stable and loving household as a child, and I don't want to be insensitive or show a lack of understanding. I do my best to give her space when I think it's needed and to listen, but I don't often know just what to say, or if I need to say anything.\nTL;DR:"}

What do we do?\nPOST: Boyfriend and I have been dating for a year this thursday 2/19 and it is the most wonderful, passionate, serious relationship either of us have experienced.\n\nThis seems to be one of the hardest compromises we've had to work out so far. In addition to him having a hard time falling asleep without television on, he has a physical therapy exercise that he does at bedtime where he lays on his side hanging his wrist off the bed with a weight. Because of this, he has to lay with his back to me during which time he likes to have Netflix on to watch with me spooning him from behind. \n\nHowever, even after his exercise is over, he still has a hard time falling asleep without television. Additionally, I fall asleep fairly quickly so by the time his half hour exercise is over, I'm ready to fall asleep anyway.\n\nI tried suggesting he do his exercise during the day, but there isn't a good time to lay in bed for a half hour with his busy schedule.\n\nWe have such a passion for genuine conversation and hate it when couples go out to dinner together and spend the whole time on their phones not talking, but I feel like that is exactly what we are doing by going to bed with tv instead of affection and conversation.

He was very flirtatious with me at first and teased me a lot but also complimented me and seemed to have a positive opinion of me. After a build up of sexual tension we ended up fooling around one time but he landed himself a serious girlfriend soon after so we never went further or talked about it. \n\nAs time goes on he has stopped flirting with me (which is understandable since he has a serious girlfriend now) but he's also started acting like a bit of a jerk to me. He still jokes around and teases me but where he used to sometimes compliment me he now sneaks in a lot of remarks implying that I'm stupid or lazy or slutty (for example, he keeps implying that I'm sleeping with a co-worker who I'm not even interested in), to the point that it's starting to hurt my self esteem. He uses the same playful insults whenever he sees me and even though I know I'm not stupid or slutty he makes me feel bad about myself anyway.\n\nIs he just saying these things because he doesn't know how to deal with me now that he has a girlfriend, or does he genuinely think I'm stupid? Did he ever really like me or were his compliments just to try to get in my pants? I don't think he's trying to hurt my feelings on purpose but the things he says are becoming really hurtful and I want to confront him about it.\nTL;DR:"}

I keep up with slickdeals, coupons, and seasonal sales.

Does the will need to leave property to the trustee, but the terms of the trust exist as a physically separate document?  If it's allowable to have the terms of the trust as an article of the will (e.g. Article II -- Terms of the Trust, Article III -- Duties of the Trustee, etc.) then what exactly is the meaning?\n\nAnd before you ask, I will indeed ask my attorney.  But, I'd still love your opinion on its meaning and *why it's phrased in such a way.*  Thanks for any help you can provide.\nTL;DR:"}

I like to think of myself as outgoing but when it comes to a girl I'm attracted to it kind of disipates, it's like, there's nothing to talk about.  I dated a girl last summer who dumped me because of the gaps we had, and lack of connection mentally.  I just don't understand conversation constantly, like I don't get it.  I try and try, I'm a very likeable person I just lack conversation.  I hate the girls I've lost simply because I'm awkward like that.

She hates them,  I started watching them only on my phone, she told me if I stopped watching them she would love me again.  This is completely a manipulation.

All of this was written in e-mail to which I responded I agreed.\n\nI completed the first date and received my first $X and decided to continue to the later date to get the second $X. I'm substantially complete with the projects due and my employer gives me a Severance Agreement with the second $X, but the severance agreement also has clauses in there on not being able to sue, not defaming them, not discussing the agreement with people other than family and attorneys, etc. The agreement is basically giving up several rights that I had no idea I would have to give up in order to get any of the $X.\n\nI do not want to sign the agreement. I do want to sign a final written agreement to make sure I am paid the second $X accordingly, but I feel I do not have to give up my rights when I stayed to benefit the employer.

Everything has been great pretty much, but I have one concern. For the first 3 months there was a lot of excitement and passion as most new relationships have. But as of more recently, it seems like the passion will intermittently die off. My concern is how to deal with the mood changes that seem like declining interest in me. I'm unsure if it's normal and I'm now witnessing the effect of the sizzled out honeymoon effect, or if there is something to be legitimately concerned about. I'm even more concerned with how to react during these times. \n\nFor example, he usually holds my hand or makes very endearing physical touches that make my heart melt. But then there will be spans of about 4 days where he won't and his head seems elsewhere. He will also limit his comfort level at my place, no making out or anything and take off early. My initial reaction is to get really cold, but I'm not sure if that is aiding into a self fulfilling prophecy of things going bad. Should I just shrug it off as a temporary mood that has become more frequent? Should I keep my cold shoulder to maintain a balance of affection during these times? Should I try talking to him about it? I'm usually a super talker and like to make everything transparent, but I've come to realize that that isn't always the best case scenario as paranoia can manifest itself in self fulfilling prophecy.

Yet, im still feeling bad about how things turned out and most of all, how big of an asshole i was and how inconsiderate jerk i was towards her.\n\nBasically, why i broke up was cuz i didnt feel the same for her as she for me even tho i had really much fun with her and everything was fine at first. I felt like there was not that spark, but was it just cuz i was too afraid to let myself fall in love again.\nI think i started fucking up our relationship by not telling her some things. Eg. when the previous girl asked me for a coffee and i did tell this only after i already had agreed to meet her. Also prior our dating, i was taking antidepressants, which i quitted last summer, so i been also afraid was my somwtimes general uninterest towards her due to the pills.\n\nIn the end, im afraid i was just too dwelled in my own problems that i didnt pay attention to her. Was i just too lazy to put any effort into this relationship. Also, im bisexual and sometimes i just wanted to do guys. But, now that everything is over i find myself missing her but is it just cuz im so lonely now. Also, sucks that only now i realize so many things i should have done differently and discussed about our issues and most of all that i wasnt being honest with her in the first place. Now all i see is just utter gray and shit when i try to see myself in the future..\nTL;DR:"}

Now Windows Explorer is telling me that I've used 180 GB of this space, and I know it is lying to me. I've only used 77 GB of the space.\n\nNow let's clear a few things up right away. **Here is what I've done:**\n\n* I've run a virus scan and a spyware scan. My computer is clean - even though I'm a Windows user, I take good care of my machine. \n\n* I ran TreeSize, which totally has my back and told me I'm using 77 GB, all of which I can account for.\n\n* Even so, I ran CCleaner just in case, but it didn't turn up anything new.\n\n* I know Windows Vista runs a backup shadow copy. I used the command prompt to find out how much space it was allocating. It told me about 33 GB. I've heard the default amount is generally 15% of your hard drive, so this makes perfect sense.\n\nHowever, if you add the space allocated for the backup shadow copy to what TreeSize says I'm using, the total is still only 110 GB. Windows is telling me that 180 GB are being used.\n\nAnd I can't figure out why.\n\nThe only lead I've got is something I heard floating around on message boards about Vista making several shadow copies. However I have no idea how to check and see if this is the case, but it may explain the 70 GB that are unaccounted for.\n\nReddit, you guys have always been awesome: please, if you have any ideas, take a minute out of your day to help me out. It's really bugging me that I can't figure this out on my own.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: How to deal with a breakup neither of us want. Me [24M,American] Her [27F,Chinese].\nPOST: This is a very complicated situation, but basically my GF of a few months is being forced by her parents to leave me and marry her Ex, who she doesn't love and doesn't want to marry.\n\nMy GF is Chinese and was with her Ex for ~5 yrs (also Chinese). Both of their families and their friends expected them to get married. They split about 10 months ago because there simply wasn't any love between them. My understanding is that her Ex basically walked all over her and made her miserable.\n\nMy GF and I [American] have been dating for a few months now and we have both been very happy. The problem is her Ex has decided he wants to marry my GF. He admits he doesn't lover her and wants to marry her because she makes life easy for him. Seriously. He contacted his parents and my GF's parents and both parties want them to get married immediately, within 1 month. It's not exactly an arranged marriage, but it's something like it. They already bought her plane tickets to fly from East Coast to West Coast to be with her Ex in 2 weeks, without even asking or notifying her that they were going to do that.\n\nShe has told me she doesn't love him, doesn't want to marry him, and will not be happy. I believe her, I can see the pain on her face clearly. She hasn't officially made a decision yet, but I can see the writing on the wall. It seems like she will probably go along with this plan, even though she hates it. She can't fathom defying her parents.\n\nSo my question is, what the hell do I do? How do I deal with this? We were planning our future together long term just last week. We are both in love and *very* happy together. It's one thing to have an relationship end when one or both parties are unhappy, but it's so painful to be torn apart when everything is perfect. I don't know how to deal with this.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [21F] with my BF[24] 2yrs, how do I make him understand I dont want a big wedding?\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 2years. Weve talked about about getting married and Im absolutely thrilled to be with him. I Love him, however we only recently started talking about the actual process of getting married.\n\n Ive never wanted a big or expensive wedding, honestly my dream wedding is a winter wedding in VT, a place that is close to my heart, with a small ceremony and small reception at a little restored 1800's church/courthouse that my family friends own. When I communicated this to him he got really upset. Hes got a huge family, he 'needs' about 60 people at the wedding. If he doesn't invite them its considered disrespecting his family. Not once did he mention if he actually wanted them there(a lot of his family he doesn't even like), only that he doesn't want the back lash from not inviting them. The only way we could have a wedding is if we did it close to NY(where were from) and invite everyone. We cant have our own ceremony in VT and an extra reception for his family.   \n\nPersonally I dont think that I should have to throw a lavish party for 60 people just so they arent mad at him. We *do not* have the money for anything close to that. Were still looking to buy a house together, but Id have to put that all on hold to get married. I know that we could do a small courthouse thing but honestly I really dont want that(neither does he) we both want to have **our** special day. I dont want 60+people there. I dont want to pay for the booze and the food. Id rather have a small personal event celebrating our love.\nTL;DR:"}

I see so many posts on here about people having roommate issues and while of course, not all issues can be avoided, I want to start on as good a foot as I can. Friends who have done similar things have told me that if i post on the university's facebook page or something that I'll surely get a lot of responses, but I want to know what to start off asking people in order to make sure we're compatible in a roommate sense.\n\nI'm practical enough to know the person may not be my best friend, but I've had everything from great experiences to truly lousy ones in terms of roommates, and I'd like anyone's input. I've lived on my own for the last year, and while it was exactly what I wanted at the time, I find now that it does get pretty quiet and that splitting responsibilities as well as cheaper rent would be pretty nice.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: My[23M] younger cousin[17M] asked my girlfriend[22F] if she wanted to hook up. What am I dealing with here?\nPOST: So there is a wedding happening tonight and most of the guests (me, my girlfriend and my family) had to arrive a day early and stay in a hotel. Last night, we all had dinner, and everything was fine and dandy and my girlfriend got well acquainted with everyone. \n\nFast forward to this morning, I get up early to go for a jog and when I come back, I see everyone near the lobby having breakfast except for my girlfriend. I went up to our room and saw that she was eating by herself, and she seemed really troubled. She said it was nothing and eventually warmed up again, after some talking and cheering up. But once I tried initiating some sex, she got REALLY distracted, and we couldn't get things going :(\n\nEventually, she told me that my cousin knocked on our door shortly after I left (he must have watched me leave...). He asked her if she was \"down for a quickie before he gets back\" as she described. I immediately felt disgusted, and angry, and ashamed to be in the same gene pool. This cousin of mine has been my favorite cousin. We were best of friends in the family and were inseparable as kids. Even as we got older, I took him under my wing, and shared my wisdom and experiences with him. I risked my ass for him on several occasions (supplying booze, etc.) and drove him to the parties he wasn't allowed to go to. I've spotted him cash on several occasions because he doesn't have a part-time job yet, and even gave him some driving lessons. All this, for an ungrateful, horny, sheltered little brat! He's gone too far!\n\nI want to beat his face in (despite being smaller, and less athletic) or possibly shun him out of my life forever. But Reddit, he is my cousin, my family. Part of me still wants to believe that all parties can get past this and end up on good terms. Is it possible for us to make peace with this? Nothing happened (physically) between them but my cousin acted very poorly and my girlfriend is left uncomfortable around my family. And I'm a confused mess.\nTL;DR:"}

Maybe 3 texts or snapchats in a day. When I'm lucky, a 20 minute conversation. We don't fight, we both understand that the other has obligations, we trust each other. I would really like a \"Good Morning\" and a \"Good Night.\" Its starting to feel like I have a part time boyfriend with full time commitment.

What do I do?\nPOST: I have been talking to this guy for 5 months now. He was previously in a 3 1/2 year relationship with a girl who manipulated and used him to the point of him being whipped. He now has this fear of all women being manipulative and has all the wrong views of relationships. He knows I am not like this at all, and multiple times we have gotten close to dating, but he always pulls back because I know he is afraid. Every time this happens it hurts me. I don't know what to do other than being his friend to show him I'm not like that. \n\nHe also has told me one reason why he is afraid of dating me is because if we broke up, he doesn't want to lose a good friend. In all honesty, if he got with another girl I wouldn't be able to stick around and watch that in the first place. It would hurt too much. I don't like sounding full of myself, but everything he wants in a relationship, I know I can offer him. He wants to try the single life next semester, and more or less let himself loose, but I don't know if I can hold on that long while he realizes that what he's doing isn't for him. \n\nSo, has anyone been on either end of this situation who can help me? I really like him, and past all his problems he needs to get over, he is everything I look for in a guy. What do I do?\nTL;DR:"}

{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: In my small college town, the police are notoriously bad about raiding parties and assaulting people, breaking down doors and violating domiciles without search warrants. What are ways we can either A: prevent this from happening again, or B: present this problem to the appropriate public officials?\nPOST: Example: One night my fraternity had a party with 200+ people. We had taken the appropriate measures to assure the police couldn't come inside, and there was security to make sure nothing got out of hand. The police were called and showed up to our party. They opened the gate without asking, and preceded to knock on the door. Since everyone was inside, we followed protocol and had our sober over 21 risk management chair step outside to talk to the police. When he opened the door, they pushed him out of the way knocking him to the ground and told everyone to get out. Keep in mind they had no search warrant or permission to come inside. They then proceed to usher everyone out and search the house for \"drugs\". there were no minor arrests, but they still arrested the house owner for providing alcohol to minors. The worst part is, they told everyone to drive home and get off of the property, meaning there were at the time at least 50 drunk drivers on the roads. I have heard multiple other horror stories as well, and have witnessed at least two other occasions in which the police clearly violated their power. I would really like to know how to stop this.\nTL;DR:"}
{"prompt": "Very precise and concise. input: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [19/M] Have no idea what to do...\nPOST: To help you understand a little more I'll go back a little bit... In my first real relationship I was with her for like 8 months...things were great mostly throughout but for some reason the relationship ended up dying and she didn't seem to care about it any-more, so it ended quite badly..After 2 years of emotional repair (I really feel hard for this girl) I'm where I basically am now. A month ago I started dating someone who I met on-line that I got along with massively. We met up a few times and even went to a gig together and I know for a fact at the start I felt very much in love with her. We met up again a few times and in that time I got to know of her past. She went through a lot of traumatic stuff and already being through things already such as helping people with depression/other issues I suddenly felt a dead weight in my chest that this would come and bite me...Other the next few days I started feeling more and more anxious about our relationships and all the things I loved about her I started to not even think of anything I literally just started to worry instead... For some reason the 2 hour distance between us now felt bigger than ever, and all these little problems just started getting to me so badly...enough so that I told her I wouldn't be able to do it any-more and that maybe I wasn't actually fit to be in a relationship. She took it amazingly well and we play to see each-other as friends because we get on really well! But quite honestly I don't even know what to feel any-more cause I 100% still have feelings for this girl...and I also 100% don't want to string her along or anything. Is what I was feeling in the relationship normal? Did I panic and freak out of things way too fast and lose the opportunity to be with a great girl..?\nTL;DR:"}
